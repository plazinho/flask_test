Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black


Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah

Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

See me ride out of the sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right

Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight

'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T., and I'll win the fight
T.N.T., I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode

I'm dirty, mean, I'm mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?

So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
Run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess me 'round

'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T., and I'll win the fight
T.N.T., I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode

Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I’d rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
Woo!

Thunder, ah

I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

You've been - thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow


Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck
 
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me


You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long
 
If you're having trouble with the high school head
He's giving you the blues
You wanna graduate, but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do:
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me anytime

Just ring: 3-6, 2-4, 3-6, hey
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)

You got problems in your life of love?
You got a broken heart?
He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the tear drops start, fella
Pick up the phone, I'm here alone
Or make a social call

Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball

Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)

If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand

For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back-door man

Well I'm rather upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
The social pages say I've got
The biggest balls of all

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
They're such big balls
And they're dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got
Great balls of fire

I've got big balls
Oh, I've got big balls
'N' they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night

We've got big balls
We've got big balls
We've got big balls
Dirty big balls
He's got big balls
She's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

(We've got big balls

And I'm just itching to tell you about them
Oh we had such wonderful fun
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
