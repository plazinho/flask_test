I remember
Ooh, how the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else

Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
Just waiting

I spoke
To a man down at the tracks
And I ask him
How he don't go mad
He said "Look here, Junior
Don't you be so happy
And for Heaven's sake
Don't you be so sad"
Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
Hesitating

Well, the Cadillac
It pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me
All they said, "Get in"
"Get in"
Then the Cadillac
It puttered back into the graveyard
Me
I got out again

Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Over there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
I ain't waitin', uh uh


I remember
How the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It was a tight toy night, streets so bright
The room was so thin between my bones and skin
There stood another person who was a little surprised
To be face to face with a world so alive

How I fell (Did you feel low?)
No (Huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo

You know it's all like some new kind of drug
My senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves
Broadway looked so medieval
It seemed to flap, like little pages
And I fell sideways laughing
With a friend from many stages

How we felt (Did you feel low?)
Not at all (Huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo

Suddenly, my eyes went so soft and shaky
I knew there was pain, but pain is not aching
Then Richie, Richie said:
"Hey man, let's dress up like cops, think of what we could do"
But something, something
It said, "You'd better not"
And I fell (Did you feel low?)
Nah (Huh?)
I stood up, walked out of the arms of Venus de Milo5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What I want, I want now
And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow"
I wanna fly, fly a fountain
I wanna jump, jump, jump, a-jump on a mountain
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no evil
I get ideas, I get a notion
I want a nice little boat made out of ocean
I get your point, you're so sharp
Getting good reactions with your evil talk
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no evil

Don't say unconscious, no don't say doom
Well, if you got to say it, oh let me leave this room
'Cause what I want, I want now
And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow," get it?
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no evil
I'm runnin' wild with the one I love (I see no evil)
I'm runnin' crazy with the one I love (I see no evil)
I keep on dancin' with the one I love (I see no evil)
You control the feelings of the one you love (I see no evil)
You control the feelings of the one you love (I see no evil)
You can feed the fires of the one you love (I see no evil)
You combine fusion with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love...2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I knew it must've been a-some big set-up
All the action just would not let up
It's just a little bit back from the main road
Where the silence spreads and the men dig holes

I start to spin the tale
You complain of my diction
You give me friction (Friction!)
You give me friction (Friction!)
You give me friction (Friction!)

My eyes are like telescopes
I see it all backwards, but who wants hope?
If I ever catch that ventriloquist
I'll squeeze his head right into my fist

Something come a-tracking in
What is it? What's the prediction?
I'll bet you it's friction (Friction!)
I'll betcha it's friction (Friction!)
I'll bet you it's friction (Friction!)
How does a snake get out of its skin?
Here's a depiction...
Oh, stop this head motion, set the sails
You know all us boys gonna wind up in jail

Well, I don't wanna grow up
There's too much contradiction
And too much friction (Friction!)
But I dig friction (Friction!)
You know I'm crazy 'bout friction (Friction!)
F-R-I-C-T-I-O-N

(Friction!)
(Friction!)
(Friction!)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The last word
Is the lost word
Why don't you say so?
Say so

I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores

Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head

Now, you give me no trouble
And you give me no help
It is the clown
That works so well

I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores

Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Our lips are sealed
Our breath is burning
These cold, wild seas
Have left us turning

But I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores

Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Torn curtain reveals another play
Torn curtain, such an expos√©!
I'm uncertain when beauty meets abuse
Torn curtain loves all ridicule

(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Flowing by like tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before

Torn curtain giving me the glance
Torn curtain is bringing on the trance
But I'm not hurting, holding to the thread
Torn curtain lifts me on the tread

(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling by like years
(Years, years) The tears I never shed

Torn curtain, feels more like a rake
Torn curtain, how much does it take?
Burn it down
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before

Do I, do I
Belong to the night?
Only, only
Only tonight
All the ladies
Stay inside
Time may freeze
A world could cry
All this night
Running loud
I hear the whispers
And I hear the shouts
And though they never
Cry for help

Tell me who sends these
Infamous gifts
To make such a promise
And make such a slip
Oh, no
Can't pull a trick
Never the rose
Without the prick
Oh, but tell me
How do I say?
I woke up
And it's yesterday
Do I again
Face this night?

Guiding light, guiding light
Guiding through these nights

Darling, darling
Do we part like the seas?
The roaring shells
The drifting of the leaves
But all intent
Remains unknown
It's time to sit up
Sit up in the throne
You've seen before
But it's always new
So look close
And see who's come through
Never again
To face this night

Guiding light, guiding light
Guiding through these nightsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The docks
The clock
A whisper woke him up
The smell of water would resume
The cave
The waves
Of light, the unreal night
The flat curving of a room
Get funny

Prove it
Just the facts
Confidential
Ah, this case
This case
This case that I
I've been workin' on so long
So long

First you creep
Then you leap
Up about a hundred feet
You're in so deep that you could write a book
Chirp, chirp
The birds
They're giving you the words
A word's just a feeling you undertook

Prove it
Just the facts
Confidential
Ah, this case
This case
This case that I
I've been workin' on so long
So long

Now, the rose
How it slows
You in such colorless clothes
Fantastic! You lose your sense of human
Project
Protect
It's warm and it's calm and it's perfect
It's too "too too" to put a finger on
Prove it
Just the facts
Confidential
Ah, this case
This case
This case that I
I've been workin' on so long
So long

This case is closed2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
O rose of my heart, can't you see
I don't belong to misery
Though she speaks fine with subtle art
Such misery clothes the rose of my heart
Now what I see in the long twilight
A star falls down on a hill so white
On a hill so white
A face that glows in a golden hue
No-one in this world knows what they do
I take my oath and I make my vow
For the tender things are upon me now
In the fragrance sweet of the evening air
I could leave this world quite without a care
O rose of my heart, the vision dims
The time is brief, now the shadow swims
I buy for you a real fine hat
Cause that's for you and that's where that's at
Now what I see in the long twilight
A star falls down on a hill so white
O rose of my heart
O rose of my heart
O rose of my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Guess I need some education
Grab some whilst I have the chance to free
Twice upon a time hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
Plastic bow wow no can't remember, can't remember, no!
In my arms she's warm and smooth
All the bones in heaven move
I'm just a dipstick, yes I like that frying but babe
That cop, that cop, hey! That cop's from
That cop's from MARS, baby!
Ha. Mars. Mars... (Mars...)
Fireballs, in the air
Fireball, everywhere
Hot bubbles, made of light
Zoom into skin all night
All night!
In my arms she's warm and smooth
Make all the bones in heaven move
I'm just a dipstick searching for truth and cop...
Hey, that cop, that cop's from... from... from Mars! Mars!
Ding-a-ling-ding-a-ling-ling-ling time to get up
Must have some coffee, let's have some caw-fee
I die a coupla times for you (for you)
I die a coupla times a night for you
In my arms so warm and smooth
Every bone in heaven moving smooth
(?) You crack up fine and test I'm all forever (?)
That cop, hey, that cop's from
That cop's from Mars, baby!
In my arms so warm and smooth
All the bones in heaven crack and movin' (move in?)
I know I'm offering but that cop's from Mars, Mars, Mars, baby

Up in the high, high hills
With my floating friend
Watching all the silver
No one will ever spend
I feel the touch of her hand
And all it will erase
These footprints I followed
Though they followed my every pace

Days
Days
Days
Be more than all we have

No matter how much I cross
I always see the same stream
I'm standing up on these bridges
That are standing in a dream

Days
Days
Days
Be more than all we have

We did good on an inside job
But now I'm down to wait
No I can't get out
But you could get across with ease
Dial 45‚Ä¶ 41‚Ä¶ oh oh oh
Call Mr Lee
He'll know the code is broken
Tell him the dog is turning red
Call Mr Lee
Just one little trip
And you're sweet for life
Help me out
You know you can't be seen
You could get across with ease
Dial 45‚Ä¶ 41‚Ä¶ oh oh oh

Paint the windows black

The elevator called me up
She said, "You better start making sense."
The stone was bleeding
Whirling in the waltz
I went to see Her Majesty
The court had no suspense
She said, "Dream dreams the dreamer."
I said, "It's not my fault."1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Last night, I drifted down to the docks
The water, glittering and black
The snow fell lightly and disappeared
I felt the old ropes grow slack

I thought I'd dissolve
When the beacon revolved
I just get carried, so carried
Carried away

Once, I had a ship
Yes, I had a map
I had the wind
Like a tree has sap

I sank into
These banks of clay
I just get carried, so carried
Carried...

Those rooms were freezing
And always dark
But where we were never mattered
Your head was golden
There was lightning in your arms
And then the glass shattered
It was noon at midnight
The day that never ends
The lamp, it whispers
And makes amends

Everything was more
Than I took it for
I just get carried, so carried
Carried awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Now Little Johnny Jewel
Oh, he's so cool
He had no decision
He's just trying to tell a vision
But some thought that this was sad
And others thought it mad
They just scratching the surface;
J.J., he could do the floor kiss
Oh, was he on display?
No, no, not today
All that guy ever said
He said, "I want my little wing-head"
He half-asleep at night
Over his head, sensation of flight
And he wake up dreaming
Dreaming...
And he run down to the airport--
The rush, the roar
And he crouched down behind the fence
With a chest full of lights
Then...
He loses his senses
Oh, Little Johnny Jewel
He's so cool
But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gotta come on so boss
And you know that he's paid
You know that he's paid the price
All you gotta do for that guy...
Is wink your eyeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I jump out of bed
I pull down the shade
I used to have such sweet dreams
Now it's more like an air raid
I see the opposition clear
Oh, I see them stare

(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) I never think about it
(I don't care)

Slip out of myself like a shadow
And somersault through walls
I can't tell, it's really so odd
Is it spring or fall?
Your wine is just sour grapes
Pour me a glass anytime I'm not there

(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) I never think about it
(I don't...)
(Careful, careful) I'm not bitter, I just get so sore
(Careful, careful) You know, I need that girl more and more
'Cause when she whispers
Oh, in my ear
It gets so hard, it gets so hard
It gets so hard

To get out of bed
It's more than I can do
If someone must work today
Then let it be you
All this confusion
It hit me like a dare

(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) I never think about it
(I don't care)
(I don't care) It doesn't matter to me
(I don't care) It never enters my mind
(I...)
(I don't care) All of it matters to me
(I don't care) Who cares?
(I don't care)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Soldier boy stands
At a full salute
Wants your orders
To execute
Send him out
'Neath the screaming red lights
In a narrow ditch
For the funny fights

(Foxhole, foxhole) Oh no, danger
(Foxhole, foxhole) Where's my guardian angel?
(Foxhole, foxhole) Oh, no

You show me the war
I don't know what for
You show me the war
But that war - such a bore

In the line of duty
In the line of fire
A heartless heart
Is my proper attire
(Foxhole, foxhole) Too much danger
(Foxhole, foxhole) Where's my guardian angel?
(Foxhole, foxhole) Too much danger

The flashing sword
It's been explored
A perfect slice
A perfect slice of life

I feel the shells hit
Moonlight web
Goodbye arms
So long, head

(Foxhole, foxhole) Too much danger
(Foxhole, foxhole) Hello, guardian angel
(Foxhole, foxhole) Oh, more danger

You pin me down
Go ahead, it's a cinch
You pin me down
You'll feel the pinch
I was trained for the fights
(Foxhole, foxhole)
(Foxhole, foxhole)
(Foxhole, foxhole)
(Foxhole, foxhole)

I was out stumbling in the rain
Staring at your lips so red
You said, "'Blah, blah, blah."
I got a pillow stuck in my head

How could I argue with a mirror?
She looked at me - yes, I hear her

When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry

She said, "There's a halo on that truck."
"Won't you please get it for me?"
I said, "Of course, my little swan."
"If ever and ever you adore me."

She got mad - she said, "You're too steep."
Puts on her boxing gloves and went to sleep
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry
When I see the glory
I ain't gotta worry

(I used to see so poorly) When I see the glory
(And then I saw the glory) I ain't gotta worry
(Now, I used to worry) When I see the glory
(Then I saw the glory) I ain't gotta worry
(Oh, I saw the glory) When I see the glory
(And I see the glory) I ain't gotta worry

(Hurry, hurry, hurry) I ain't gotta worry

Storms all that summer
We lived in the wind
Out in some room in the wind
Your hands, they were folded
You knew no demands
My tongue, it clattered like tin

My eyes repeat
They take my seat
Your eyes, they say you resigned from the heat

We leaned in the cold
Holding our breath
Watching the corners turn corners

Coins on the table
The cards in the air
The face at the window kept smiling
Storms all that winter
We stayed locked away
Waiting, watching, falling
End of the street
Horizons retreat
You, you ran with it
I wish I could
Sleep is not sleep
My eyes repeat
You take the voltage
That watches you weep

You caught the voice
I listen close
All that I heard was the echoes

Praise emptiness
Her rose-colored dress
Her circling motions
Praise emptiness
Everything scattered
Nothing was missed
We took our house in the fire1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
