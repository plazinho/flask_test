Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real, don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it

Come a little bit closer, baby
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out, boy, let's work it out, boy
Any deal that we endeavour
Boys and girls feel good together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it
Are you as good as I remember, baby?
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Be a little bit wiser, baby
Put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Ah, say you'll be there
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear

Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going round in circles
Tell me, will this deja vu never end? Oh

Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, ay
This time you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
(I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there
(Say you will be there)
Ow, say you will be there
A-won't you sing it with me?
If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation then
I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

I'm (I'm), giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And (and), all that I want from you (all I want from you)
Is a promise you (is a promise you) will be there
Yeah, I want you

Any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'll give you everything, on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is a promise you (want you to promise to)
Will be there (always be there)
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)

Will be there (always be there)

You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever

Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do
Do do-do, always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba
Ba da-ba, stay that way forever
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time
You need, less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you, wanna thank you) I need somebody with a human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much, thank you very much) Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Do you still remember
How we used to be
Feeling together
Believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour
My spirit I gave ya
We'd only just begun

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes, I still remember
Every whispered word
The touch of your skin
Giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers
Like the sands of time
Promises made
Every memory saved
As reflections in my mind
Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold
They will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting (everlasting), like the sun (like the sun)
Live forever (live forever), for the moment (for the moment)
Ever searching (ever searching) for the one (for the one)
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting

The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good, as long as you're getting
What's driving you is ambition I'm betting

(I said-a) Who do you think you are?
(Do you think you are?) oh, oh, oh
(I said-a) Who, some kind of superstar?
(You have got to) oh, oh, oh

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show how good you are

You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Climbing the snake up the ladder, but you're wrong

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are

You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control

Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me

Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast

Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me
Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

What part of no don't you understand
(understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can

Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Listen, little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me

Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never change it, no, no, no
(No, no, no, no)

Just a little girl, big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (into the world), what a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never change it, no, no, no
(No, no, no, no)
You know it's time to say goodbye
(No, no, no, no)

The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby
Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never, never ever change it
(No, no, no, no) You know it's time to say goodbye
(No, no, no, no) And don't forget you can rely
(No, no, no, no) You know it's time to say goodbye
And don't forget, on me you can rely
(No, no, no, no) I will help, help you on your way
I will be with you every day
(No, no, no, no) I will be with you every day2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood (Mama)
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend

I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I've had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
You're my friend

But now I'm sure I know why (I know why)
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes (see through your eyes)
All that you did was love (all I can give you is love)

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
You're my friend
