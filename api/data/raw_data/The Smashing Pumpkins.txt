Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around
 
The world is a vampire
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers
Hold you up to the flames
And what do I get
For my pain?
Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I wanna change
What do you got
When you feel the same?

Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, yeah
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son, for you

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage!

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a…
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, for you

And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
 
Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave
Without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change the less you feel

Believe
Believe in me
Believe, believe
That life can change
That you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same
We're different

Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, so bright
Tonight (tonight)

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade
In your city by the lake
The place where you were born

Believe
Believe in me
Believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance

Tonight (tonight)
Tonight, so bright
Tonight (tonight)

We'll crucify the insincere tonight (tonight)
We'll make things right
We'll feel it all tonight (tonight)
We'll find a way to offer up the night tonight
The indescribable moments of your life (tonight)
The impossible is possible tonight (tonight)
Believe in me as I believe in you

Tonight...
Tonight, tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
 
Today is the greatest
Day I’ve ever known
Can’t live for tomorrow
Tomorrow’s much too long
I’ll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I’ve ever known
Can’t wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I’ll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known
 
Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love, I send this smile over to you

Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love, I send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
 
Fool enough to almost be it
Cool enough to not quite see it
Doomed
Pick your pocket, full of sorrow
And run away with me tomorrow
June

We'll try and ease the pain
But somehow, we'll feel the same
Well, no one knows
Where our secrets go

I send a heart to all my dearies
When your life is so, so dreary
Dream
I’m rumored to the straight and narrow
While the harlots of my perils
Scream

And I fail
But when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will


Mother, weep the years I’m missing
All our time can’t be given
Back
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
That cursed you and your reasons
Out of hand and out of season
Out of love and out of feeling
So bad

When I can, I will
Words defy the plans
When I can, I will

Fool enough to almost be it
And cool enough to not quite see it
Dull enough to always feel this
Always old, I'll always feel this
No more promise, no more sorrow
No longer will I follow
Can anybody hear me?
I just want to be me

And when I can, I will
Try to understand
That when I can, I will
 
My reflection, dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover, I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when we're really gonna need 'em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride?

She's the one for me
She's all I really need (oh yeah)
She's the one for me

Emptiness is loneliness
And loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness
And God is empty just like me

Intoxicated with the madness
I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth
I never let on that I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down

You blame yourself
For what you can't ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more

She's the one for me
She's all I really need, Oh Yeah
She's the one for me
She's my one and only
 
Freak out and give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know
Who is righteous, what is bold
So I’m told

Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Hipsters unite
Come align for the big fight to rock (For you)
But beware
All those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down
They are frightened and they're scared
If you don't stare

Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out


Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
I know, I know, I know
Should have listened when I was told

Who wants that honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
(Let)
Let me out
 
Nothing left to say
And all I've left to do
Is run away from you
And she led me on, down
With secrets I can't keep

Close your eyes and sleep
Don't wait up for me
Hush now, don’t you speak
To me

Wrapped my hurt in you
And took my shelter in that pain
The opiate of blame
Is your broken heart, heart, your heart
Soma

I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
And I'll betray my tears
To anyone caught
In our ruse of fools

One last kiss for me, yeah
One last kiss good night

Didn't want to lose you once again
Didn't want to be your friend
Fulfilled a promise made of tin
And crawled back to you

I'm all by myself
(Close your eyes and sleep)
As I've always felt
(Don't wait up for me)
I'll betray myself
(Hush now, don't you speak)
To anyone, lost, anyone but you


So let the sadness come again
On that you can depend on me, yeah
Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah
When God sleeps in bliss

I'm all by myself
As I've always felt
I'll betray myself
To anyone

And you need to resist the devil so that he will flee
 
What moonsongs
Do you sing your babies?
What sunshine do you bring?
Who belongs?
Who decides who's crazy?
Who rights wrongs where others cling?

I'll sing for you
If you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break

I go along
Just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you
And those moonsongs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through

I'll hear your song
If you want me to
I'll sing along
And it’s a chance I'll have to take
And it’s a chance I'll have to break

I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
(So in love)
I'm in love with you
(With you)
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
(So in love)
I'm in love with you
(I'm so in love)
I'm in love with you
With you
 
Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late, supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again

I know I'll make it, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth

And you can make it last forever, you
You can make it last forever, you
Can make it last

And for a moment, I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return

I'll make the effort, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Tomorrow's just an excuse

And you can make it last forever, you
Can make it last forever, you
Can make it last forever, you
Forever, you
 
It’s you that I adore
You’ll always be my whore
You’ll be the mother to my child
And a child to my heart

We must never be apart
We must never be apart

Lovely girl, you’re the beauty in my world
Without you, there aren’t reasons left to find

And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be perfect, just like me
You’ll be a lover in my bed
And a gun to my head

We must never be apart
We must never be apart

Lovely girl, you're the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I've left to die
Drinking mercury to the mystery
Of all that you should ever leave behind
In time

In you, I see dirty
In you, I count stars
In you, I feel so pretty
In you, I taste god
In you, I feel so hungry
In you, I crash cars

We must never be apart

Drinking mercury
To the mystery of all that you should ever seek to find
Lovely girl, you’re the murder in my world
Dressing coffins for the souls I’ve left behind
In time

We must never be apart

And you’ll always be my whore
'Cause you’re the one that I adore
And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be perfect, just like me
In you, I feel so dirty
In you, I crash cars
In you, I feel so pretty
In you, I taste god

We must never be apart
 
Faith lies in
The ways of sin
I chased the charmed
But I don't want them anymore (Yeah, yeah)
And in their eyes, I was alive
A fool's disguise
Take me away from you
Shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than I’d ever been
When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew and revive
It's alright, honey
It's alright, yeah
Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel okay?
It scares the disenchanted
Far away

Yeah, I want something new
But what am I supposed to do about you?
Yeah, I love you, it's true
Life's a bummer
When you're a hummer
Life's a drag, yeah, yeah
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free
Ask yourself a question
Anyone but me
I ain't free
Do you feel
Love is real?
 
Perfect
Perfect

I know we’re just like old friends
We just can’t pretend
That lovers make amends

We are reasons so unreal
We can’t help but feel
That something has been lost

But please, you know you’re just like me
Next time, I promise we’ll be

Perfect
Perfect
Perfect strangers down the line
Lovers out of time
Memories unwind

So far, I still know who you are
But now, I wonder who I was

Angel, you know it’s not the end
We’ll always be good friends
The letters have been sent on

So please, you always were so free
You’ll see, I promise we’ll be

Perfect
Perfect strangers when we meet
Strangers on the street
Lovers while we sleep

Perfect
You know this has to be
We always were so free
We promised that we’d be
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
 
Ten times removed
I forget about where it all began
Bastard son of a bastard son of
A wild-eyed child of the sun
And right as rain, I'm not the same but
I feel the same, I feel nothing

Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again

I sensed my loss
Before I even learned to talk
And I remember my birthdays
Empty party afternoons won't come back

Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again

I forget to forget me
I forget to forget, you see
Nothing is important to me

I knew my loss
Before I even learned to speak
And all along, I knew it was wrong
But I played along, with my birthday song

Holding back the fool again
Holding back the fool pretends
I forget to forget nothing is important
Holding back the fool again
