Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long, ooh!
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long, mmm yeah
If you are going my way (You are going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (All night long)

There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eyes
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (Life is a highway)
I want to ride it all night long (Wooh, yeah)
If you're going my way (Going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (Ooh, yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, I want to ride it all night long, babe)
If you're going my way (You going my way)
I want to drive it all night long
 
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yeah)

Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

That God bless the broken road
That led me straight to you
Oooh
 
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh


What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

Not seeing that love in you
That’s what I was trying to do
 
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything, more than anything

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish

I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you and the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you'd find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything, yeah, more than anything

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish
Yeah, yeah
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish (My wish for you)

This is my wish (My wish for you)
I hope you know somebody loves you (My wish for you)
May all your dreams stay big (My wish for you)
 
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

It's yours if you want it

Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

Oh, oh
I swear, every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby, your name is written on it
Baby, it's yours if you want it
 
She got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

Oh, she does
Back to life
 
Sprayed my name on a water tower
Carved it in an old cottonwood tree
Signed a bunch of high school yearbooks
So they wouldn't forget about me
It wasn't 'til I saw my daddy's name in stone I knew
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die?
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

When you're down to your last dollar
Will you give or will you take?
When the stiff wind blows the hardest
Will you bend or will you break? (Will you break?)
You're gonna leave a legacy, no matter what you do
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you


Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? (What did you choose?)
Oh, when it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you (How they remember you)
 
I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like ain't it me that keeps pushing you away
How any nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left?
Waking up in a stranger's bed
Don't know how I got lost
I don't know how to get back
Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed
Every morning I hear you pray for the old me
Instead of waking up, in a stranger's bed

I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a strangers bed

I know I say too little
Yeah, I'm gone too much
I don't even remember the last time we touched
Every night it's like you're sleeping with someone you've never met
And waking up in a strangers bed
I remember the words that you haven't heard for so long
You're not gone yet

I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a strangers bed
Oh no, oh woah

I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what i say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away

I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
Well, I'm gonna run back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Ooh
 
It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone

I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go

It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh, it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh, but when it rains

I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let you fall

Don't be afraid to fall
I'm right here to catch you
I won't let you down
It won't get you down
You're gonna make it
Yeah, I know you can make it

'Cause I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
Oh, I'm gonna hold you
And I won't let go

Won't let you go
No I won't
 
Someone let your secret out
Everybody 'round here's talking about, how your knight in shining armor let you down
And now you're alone, I told you so
This is what you wanted, baby, now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around, are you happy now?
Oooh, are you happy now?

Yeah, you're gonna  spend some sleepless nights
Crying in the glow of the TV light
With some sad song on and a glass of wine
Just to sit in the pain, baby, what a shame
This is what you wanted, baby now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around
Are you happy now?

Now that I'm not around (now that I'm not around)
Now that you've finally lost what you thought that you needed
Never would have treated your heart like you did

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
Oh, we were so in love, oh, but you gave that up
Just look around
Just look around

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
We were so in love (we were so in love)
But you gave that up (but you gave it up)
Just look around
Just look around
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

What goes around comes back around
