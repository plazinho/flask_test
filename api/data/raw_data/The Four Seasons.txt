Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
(Oh, what a night)
Oh, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do...8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

(Beggin') beggin' (You)
Put your loving hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby

Riding high when I was king
Played it hard and fast
'Cause I had everything
You walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Begging) beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby

I need you to understand
That I tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell
Used to be
Shadow of my life
Is hanging over me
Broken man without a throne
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The day you left me
An angel cried

The sun had faded and died
No one knew the reason why but me
That cloudy day, you went away
The clouds had filled up the skies
Like the tears that filled my eyes, lonely me
That cloudy day, you went away

Then raindrops fell (Raindrops fell)
Down from the sky
The day you left me
An angel cried
An angel cried

(My God, an angel knows)
Yes, she knows
Yes, she knows you hurt me so
She knows the reason why

The raindrops fell (Raindrops fell)
Down from the sky
The day you left me
An angel cried
An angel cried
Woah-oh, she cried
That cloudy day (That cloudy day)
You went away (You went away)
An angel cried
She criedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
My girl said good-bye (my oh my)
My girl didn't cry (I wonder why)
(Silly boy) Told my girl we had to break up
(Silly boy) Thought that she would call my bluff
(Silly boy) But she said to my surprise
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
Baby I was cruel (I was cruel)
Baby I'm a fool (I'm such a fool)
(Silly girl) Shame on you your Mama said
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you cried in bed
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you told a lie
Big girls do cry
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (that's just an alibi)
Big girls don't cry EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Walk like a man
Oh, how you tried to cut me down to size
Tellin' dirty lies to my friends
But my own father said "Give her up, don't bother
The world isn't comin' to an end"
(He said)
Walk like a man, talk like a man
Walk like a man my son
No woman's worth crawlin' on the earth
So walk like a man, my son
Bye bye baby, I don't-a mean maybe
Gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be cryin' on account of all your lyin'
Oh yeah, just look who's laughin' now
(I'm gonna)
Walk like a man, fast as I can
Walk like a man from you
I'll tell the world "forget about it, girl"
And walk like a man from you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Beware of his promise
Believe what I say
Before I go forever
Be sure of what you say

So he paints a pretty picture
And he tells you that he needs you
And he covers you with flowers
And he always keeps you dreamin'
If he always keeps you dreamin'
You won't have a lonely hour
If a day could last forever
You might like your ivory tower

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around

Beware of his promise (Bah duh duh duh duh)
Believe what I say (Bah duh duh duh duh)
Before I go forever (Bah duh duh duh duh)
Be sure of what you say
For the words may come too easy
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
And goodbye may come too quickly
If you really think he loves you
If you really think he loves you
You would give your love so sweetly
If that day could last forever
You would fall in love completely

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you foundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(B. Gaudio - B. Crewe)
Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
(Hand-me-down) When she was just a kid her clothes were hand-me-down
(Hand-me-down) They always laughed at her when she came into town
Called her rag doll, little rag doll
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace
Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
(Sad rag doll) I'd change her sad rags into glad rags if I could
(If I could) My folks won't let me 'cause they say that she's no good
She's a rag doll, such a rag doll
Though I love her so, I can't let her know
Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)
I love you just the way you are
A-ahh, ah-ah-ah-ah ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)

I solve my problems and I see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word
They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand, it's just a crying shame
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel
Grease is the word
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a mеaning
Grease is the timе, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling
This is a life of illusion
Wrapped up in trouble
Laced with confusion
What are we doing here?
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are (be who we are)
Grease is the word
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling
Grease is the word
Is the word...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
