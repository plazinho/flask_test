Tamashek-Berber/Tuareg:
Tenere ti nin
Tenere nekkim
Taqqim tafuk tedu
Teyyed fel shinawan ashni
Itissed ehad hi tismesti
Teyyed fel shinawan ashni
Tenere tekkus akan aman nes
Aman iman
Dagh aytman ghred tendam
S tenere taqqim tossam
Aghregh yallah kay s ammaqqar
Ayyetkalan tumast tartay
Oh, Tenere!
You jealous desert
Why can't you see
You are a treasure
I've seen the world
I love you better
Oh, Tenere!
You are the treasure
Of my soul
Dagh aytman ghred tendam
S tenere taqqim tossam

English:
The desert is mine
Tenere, my homeland
We come to you when the sun goes down
Leaving a trail of blood across the sky
Which the black night wipes out
The desert is hot
And its water hard to find
Water is life and soul
To all my brothers I say
The desert is jealous!
Oh, Tenere!
A jealous desert
Why can't you see
You are a treasure
I've seen the world
I love you better
Oh, Tenere!
You are the treasure
Of my soul
I cry out to God on High
To bring together my people
In unityEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Walking through it
Walking in the winter
The desert
Then I see it
My beloved
Dancing through fire
Dancing through fire
The ideals of the people have been sold off cheap, my friends
Any peace imposed by force is bound to fail
And give way to hatred
My people, where is that self-confidence
Made of dignity and beauty of spirit
That our ancestors bequeathed to us?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
J’ai bu un thé
I drank some tea
Taqqalahi tisnant alshash ere s taqqal sallul asraf

God can bear witness when I think of Chaghaybou
The pain in the stomach that takes hold of me
Has no other remedy than a heart-to-heart with him late at night
I love him and I love those he loves, into the life beyond
I pine for those handsome and brave wearers of double turbans!
Amongst them Ahmad, Hamad Ahad and their friend, Chaghaybou:
The same who dine on grilled ram
When I glimpse him dressed in his beautiful robes
Smelling of a mixture of perfumes...
His headdress crested, giving him the air of gazelles
That race through dunes strewn with desert gourds
If only I could become a stand in his mother's tent
That way I would never miss a moment he inhabits
Especially those when his mother is teaching him Tifinagh
In the sandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
MATADJEM YINMIXAN (Why all this hate between you)
MATADJEM YINMIXAN SARHREMT YARATAN
Why all this hate between you which you teach your children
TOJAWAN ALRHALEM TATERARAWAN
The world looks at you and surpasses your understanding
WAR TOLIHAM ID'KOUFAR WAR TOLIHAM D'ARABAN
You who resemble neither a westerner nor an Arab
TOMANAM ISTIWSATEN TIDIT TINDARAWAN
Your faith in the tribes blinds you to the truth
WADA AL ASSAWKA IYALAH WALAIYEN DOWAN ADAHAR
Even if God were to send a blessing down for you to share
D'IMIDINET TAFLIST IS WADEK ATEKDAR
With a friend, they will only betray your confidenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Friends, companions, hear my truth
And my conviction
These banishments that befall us
Bring no joy, neither to my heart
Nor to that of the youth
You suffer the bitterness of that oppression
Which annihilated the old folk
On whom you counted
And tortures the soul of the heart
That knows no hatredEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That tunnel vision, not television
Behind the curtain, out of the cupboard
You take the first train into the big world
Now will I find you, now will you be there?

Youth of the Sahara
We’re telling you how it is
You mustn’t doubt our aptitude
Or think we’re incapable
That world out there is more advanced
And more powerful than we are
Because it awoke before we did
Now we will awake ourselves
We’ve learned how to use other weapons
Than those our ancestors bequeathed to usEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
