La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da

We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up, come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?

Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happening)
You've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust, but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh-oh, we can learn to love again
Oh-oh, can learn to love again
Oh-oh
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again78EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up

You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out

'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
(My drug) my love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up

Mmm tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh (drug)25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fuckin' comin' true
I wish I was a lawyer
I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog
Take your house, take your shoes
Take your heart (Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
And now here comes that singin' part

I'm daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (Let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (How I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (You pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (Feel the same)
That's my plan (That's my plan), that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (Now, now)

Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh—
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it (Wait for it)
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm, yeah)
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (Let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (How I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (You pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (Feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (Oh-oh, revenge is sweet)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (Revenge is sweet)

Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century
To heal, but just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends
I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM
In my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady
Friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated
And I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up
'Cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count
Get it? (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new
Get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me
Then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Slut!
So when you're driving
Driving to his house
And you pass me
While I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember
You cheated on me first (Bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore (Eminem!)
This is war (Fellas, ladies)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Ha-ah!)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (So sweet, oh-oh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (Uh-uh-uh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Fuck yeah!
Fuck no!56EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try

Eh, eh, eh

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try
Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned

I know that I am runnin' out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please

You just gotta believe

I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)

The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps (Shit!)

At least he'll know how to hit (Oops!)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die

You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool?
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still, you said forever
And ever, who knew?
Yeah, yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and

And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep

There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight

Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss “Knowing it's all good”
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean (You're so mean)
When you talk (When you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voices)
In your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that? (Why do I do that?)

Yeah, oh, oh pretty, pretty please
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
Yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect, oh
Pretty, pretty please
