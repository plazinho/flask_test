Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, no
But when the taxman come' to the door
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!"

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, son, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son, no no no
 
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yeah!

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
 
I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise


Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
 
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

1:14 - 1:50

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
 
Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearing high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doot, doo doo
A wondrous apparition, provided by magician
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door


Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doot, doo doo
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door
 
Early in the evenin', just about supper time
Over by the courthouse, they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard, and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor boy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet


Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner, there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'…
 
Well, take me back down where cool water flow, y’all
Let me remember things I love, ah
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me, aww
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoo fly, dragon fly, get back to your mother
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River
Well


Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world is smolderin'
And if you get lost, come on home to Green River"
Well
Come on home
 
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home


When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
In them old cotton fields back home
 
Whoa, thought it was a nightmare, Lord, it all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow, the Devil's on the loose

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see

Thought I heard a rumblin', callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded, Satan cries, "Take aim"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see


Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom, fill the land with smoke"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
 
Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune
And lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I sung
Every time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
