Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
 
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So (Don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me)
'Cause I'm having a good time
Having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
(Don't stop me now)
'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

(Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me)
Hey, hey, hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I like it
(Don't stop me, don't stop me)
Have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Woah
Let loose, honey, all right


Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit (Hey)
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Hey, hey)

(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call (Ooh, alright)

'Cause I'm having a good time (Hey, hey)

Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

Ah, da, da, da, da
Da, da, ah, ah
Ah, da, da, ah, ah, ah
Ah, da, da
Ah, da, da, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
 
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back
Bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how
I still love you (I still love you)


Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright
 
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can
All over the place, singing

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner
All over the place

We will, we will rock you (Sing it out)
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back
Into your place

We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you, alright
 
(Radio)
(Radio)

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you

(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
 
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...
 
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on
 
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)

Somebody to love?

I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day) I take home
My hard-earned pay all on my own
(Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees) and I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Oh

(He works hard) everyday (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
(He's got) I got nobody left to believe
No, no, no, no


(Ooh, ooh, ooh, Lord)
Ooh somebody
Ooh (Somebody)
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Can anybody find me
Someone to love?)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losin' my beat (You just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
(One day) Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
(Find me, find me)
Find me somebody to love (Find me)

You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you

God knows, God knows I want to break free

And this time I know it's for real

Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
(It comes to you as to us all)
Yeah, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall, yeah

Oh, ev'ry night and ev'ry day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays, yeah

(Tow your line and play their game)
Yeah, let the anesthetic cover it all
('Til one day they call your name)
You know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same
Yeah baby (Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain


For he who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder
And louder and louder

You songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

"Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good
Old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh, let me feel
Your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish
Is my command

“Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What’re you doing tonight? Hey boy”
Write my letter, feel much better
I’ll use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, Love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion
In the good old fashioned
School of lover boys


Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine

In the year of '39
Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew


In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darlin', we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead, pity me
 
I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Can't see a way out

"It ain't much I'm asking"
I heard him say
"Got to find me a future
Move out of my way"

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me?
Just give me the sign

It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
For the dreams of youth

I want it all, I want it all
(Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all
(Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime
(People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all
(And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I want it all)


It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
(Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now
(Ooh, ooh) I want it now

I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh!
 
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home


Each night I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die (Ow!)

Save me, save me, save me (Oh yeah)
Yeah, save me (Yeah)
Save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh (Save me)
I'm naked and I'm far from home
