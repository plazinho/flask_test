Walk along the river, sweet lullaby
They just keep on flowin', they don't worry 'bout where it's goin', no, no

Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walkin' down the road
Early morning sunshine, tell me all I need to know, oh

You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah


Good old Sunday mornin', bells are ringin' everywhere
Goin' to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there

You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah, yeah
 
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Well, my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down Highway 41

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
When it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

All right!

I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They're always having a good time down on the bayou
Lord, and Delta women think the world of me

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
 
Crossroads, seem to come and go, yeah
The gypsy flies from coast to coast
Knowing many, loving none
Bearing sorrow having fun
But back home he'll always run
To sweet Melissa

Freight train, each car looks the same, all the same
And no one knows the Gypsy's name
No one hears his lonely sighs
There are no blankets where he lies
In all his deepest dreams the Gypsy flies
With sweet Melissa

Again the morning's come
Again he's on the run
Sunbeams shining through his hair
Appearing not to have a care
Well, pick up your gear and Gypsy roll on, roll on

Crossroads, will you ever let him go? No, no, no
Will you hide the dead man's ghost?
Or will he lie, beneath the clay?
Or will his spirit float away?
But I know that he won't stay without Melissa
Yes I know that he won't stay without Melissa
 
I've been run down
I've been lied to
I don't know why
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecked my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinking in some crosstown bar

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying


My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand by and take it, babe
All for loving you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
But nothing seems to change
The bad times stay the same
And I can't run

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying


Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying
 
Well, I've got to run to keep from hidin'
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider


And I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
I'm not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
I'm not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

When you can't find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shining bright
You feel like you've lost you're way
When the candle light of home
Burns so very far away
Well, you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say

He used to say soulshine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Hey now people, don't mind
We all get this way sometime
Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

I grew up thinking that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
Life can take the strongest man
Make him feel so alone
Now sometimes I feel a cold wind
Blowing through my aching bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said, "Boy, there is darkness before the dawn"

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah, now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control

Talking 'bout soulshine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Lord now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day
Oh, it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah, now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day
 
Ain't but one way out, baby, Lord I just can't go out the door
Ain't but one way out, baby and Lord, I just can't go out the door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know

Lord, you got me trapped, woman, up on the second floor
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more
So raise your window, baby and I can ease out soft and slow
And Lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
Talking that stuff that they don't know


Lord, I'm foolish to be here on the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place, and
Ain't no way in the world I'm going out that front door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know

'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know
'Cause there's a man down there
Lord, it just might happen to be your man
Oh, it just-a might be your man
Mmm-mm-mmm-mm
Lord, it just-a might be your man
Oh baby, I just don't know
 
Just one more mornin'
I had to wake up with the blues
Pulled myself outta bed, yeah
Put on my walkin' shoes
Went up on the mountain
To see what I could see
The whole world was fallin'
Right down in front of me

'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby
Ah help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah


Pull myself together, put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
Get back in the race

'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby, yeah
Ah help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah

Pull myself together, put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
Get back in the race

'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby, oh
Ah help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah
 
Last Sunday morning, the sunshine felt like rain
Week before, they all seemed the same
With the help of God and true friends, I come to realize
I still had two strong legs and even wings to fly

And oh I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes and faster things

Lord, Lord Miss Sally why are you crying?
Been around here three long days, looking like you're dying
Just step yourself outside and look up at the stars above
Go on downtown baby, find somebody to love

Meanwhile I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like pouring rain and much faster things

You don't need no gypsy to tell you why
You can't let one precious day slip by
Look inside yourself and if you don't see what you want
Maybe sometimes then you don't
But leave your mind alone and just get high


Well by and by, way after many years have gone
And all the war freaks die off, leaving us alone
We'll raise our children in the peaceful way we can
It's up to you and me brother to try and try again

Well hear us now, we ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes
Runnin' after subway trains
Don't forget the pouring rain
 

 
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door

I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
I woke up this morning, had them Statesboro Blues
Well, I looked over in the corner baby, and Grandpa seemed to have them too

Well my momma died and left me, my poppa died and left me
I ain't good looking baby but I'm somewhat sweet and kind
I'm goin' to the country, baby do you wanna go?
But if you can't make it baby, your sister Lucille said she wanna go
And I sure will take her

I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen
Well I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
Now she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah
And she look like a dog gone queen

Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door
