Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black


Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

Ah, yeah

Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door

In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)

And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been - thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me

Well I'm rather upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
The social pages say I've got
The biggest balls of all

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
They're such big balls
And they're dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got
Great balls of fire
I've got big balls
Oh, I've got big balls
'N' they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night

We've got big balls
We've got big balls
We've got big balls
Dirty big balls
He's got big balls
She's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
(We've got big balls
We've got big balls)

And I'm just itching to tell you about them
Oh we had such wonderful fun
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stoppin' on the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll

Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up, broken boned
Getting had, getting took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doing one night stands
Try playing in a rock-roll band
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll


Hotel, motel
Make you want to cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old, gettin' gray
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, second-hand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean

Weighing in at nineteen stone

You're a whole lotta woman

And you're a whole lotta woman
Oh, honey, you can do it

In the beginning
Back in nineteen-fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
An' all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news

He said, "Let there be sound"
There was sound
"Let there be light"
There was light
"Let there be drums"
There was drums
"Let there be guitar"
There was guitar

Oh, let there be rock


And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
And all across the land, every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The businessmen got rich
And in every bar, there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen-million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say:
"Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar"

Oh, let there be rock


One night, in the club called "The Shaking Hand"
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good, and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

"Let there be rock"4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She gave me the queen
She gave me the king
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her deuce was wild
But my ace was high

But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before?
Said she'd never had a full house
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card

But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before?
Said she'd never had a royal flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealing out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else
She's got the jack, yeah yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack

It was one of those nights
When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much
Touch me!


Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much, (much too much)
I really want to feel, yeah (touch too much)
Girl, you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much too much, too much, too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Givin' me a touch, a touch too much
Lay me down and touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
Touch
Come on, touch me
Yeah11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
