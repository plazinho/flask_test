In my room I want you here

And I'll lay right down In my favorite place

And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sands

I'm a street-walking cheetah
With a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

Honey, gotta help me, please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, detonate for me!

Look out, honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a firefight

Honey, gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey, I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin' only to destroy
Hey!
(Hey! hey!
Hey! Hey!)

Look out, honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a firefight

Honey, gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey, I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy

Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy, said, uh
Hey, forgotten boy, said
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, babe, hey, yeah

Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel with you at ease
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel your disease

There's nothing in my dreams
Just some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze

Now, if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you can be my master
I will do anything

There's nothing left alive
But a pair of glassy eyes
Raise my feelings one more time

Find a little stranger
Find a little stranger
Say you're gonna feel my hand
Say, gotta gimme danger, wild little stranger
Honey, gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger

Feelin' that same old way

Freaked out for another day
