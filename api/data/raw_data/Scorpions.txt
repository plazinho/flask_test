(Whistling)

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(Whistling)

The world is closing in
And did you ever think?
That we could be so close?
Like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
(mmmmmmm)
Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing (sing)

Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

Time, it needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there, I will be there
I'll fight, babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love
Can break down the wall someday
I will be there, I will be there

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again
I'm still loving you
Try, baby, try
To trust in my love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, our love
Just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there, I will be there

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know
What you've been through
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end
I'm still loving you
Iâ€™m still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you, I need your love
I'm still loving you25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Are you ready, babe?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
(Come on, come on, babe!)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane!

Wise man said just walk this way
To the dawn of the light
The wind will blow into your face
As the years pass you by
Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and you will find
Passage out of the dark

Here I am
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am
In the land of the morning star!

Wise man said just find your place
In the eye of the storm
Seek the roses along the way
Just beware of the thorns

Here I am
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am
In the land of the morning star!
Wise man said just raise your hand
And reach out for the spell
Find the door to the promised land
Just believe in yourself
Hear this voice from deep inside
It's the call of your heart
Close your eyes and you will find
The way out of the dark

Here I am
Will you send me an angel?
Here I am
In the land of the morning star!

Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since I've been away
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice, I would stay
 x2
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you

Girl, there are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Oh, babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine you'd come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away
 x2
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you

 x2
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do
I just want to be loved by you
No one like you7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Arrive at seven the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encores 'til eleven, then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

I call your number; the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love, I can't tell you how I feel

Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I lose control because of you babe
I lose control when you look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight
I'm not a child anymore, life has opened the door
To a new exciting life

It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart

You and i just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I, we're just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day




Time stands still
When days of innocence are falling for the night
I love you girl I always will
I swear i'm there for you until the day I'll die

Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Exchange the cold days for the sun
A good time and fun
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Exchange your troubles for some love
Wherever you are
Let me take you far away
You'd like a holiday
Longing for the sun here we come
To the island without name
Longing for the sun here we come
On the island many miles away from home
Here we come on the island without name
Longing for the sun here we come
To the island many miles away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Away from home
Away from home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Have you ever climbed the mountain?
Have you ever crossed the sea?
Take a look around the corner
And listen to your heartbeat
Have you ever touched the rainbow
Take a ride in the ferris wheel
It takes one step to start a journey
It's up to you, to make it real
This is the time for yourself to be free
You gotta follow your heart
This is the time in your life and it's never too late
To see the light in the dark
You gotta follow your heart
Walking far away horizons
You will never walk alone
You'll be at home where your heart is
A million miles away from home
Show me the way, who knows the way
This is the only road to go
Life brings me down, it takes me up
And only, only heaven knows1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Humanity, auf wiedersehen
It's time to say goodbye, the party's over
As the laughter dies, an angel cries
Humanity, it's au revoir to your insanity
You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies

You're a drop in the rain
Just a number, not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you got to deal with it
Humanity, humanity
Goodbye

Be on your way, adios amigo
There's a price to pay
For all the egotistic games you played
The world you made is gone
You're a drop in the rain
Just a number, not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you got to deal with it
Humanity, humanity
Goodbye

Run and hide there's fire in the sky
Stay inside
The water's gonna rise and pull you under
In your eyes I'm staring at the end of time
Nothing can change us
No one can save us from ourselves

You're a drop in the rain
Just a number, not a name
And you don't see it
You don't believe it
At the end of the day
You're a needle in the hay
You signed and sealed it
And now you got to deal with it
Humanity, humanity
Goodbye, goodbye
It's time4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
One day, in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to ring
It meant the time had come for one to go
To the temple of the king

There, in the middle of the circle, he stands
Searching, seeking
With just one touch of his trembling hand
The answer will be found
Daylight waits while the old man sings
Heaven help me
And then like the rush of a thousand wings
It shines upon the one
And the day had just begun

One day, in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to sing
It meant the time had come for one to go
To the temple of the king
There in the middle of the people he stands
Seeing, feeling
With just a wave of the strong right hand, he's gone
To the temple of the king


Far from the circle, at the edge of the world
He's hoping, wondering
Thinking back on the stories he's heard
Of what he's going to see
There, in the middle of a circle, it lies
Heaven help me
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
The answer had been found

Back with the people in the circle he stands
Giving, feeling
With just one touch of a strong right hand, they know
Of the temple and the kingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The job is done and I go out
Another boring day
I leave it all behind me now
So many worlds away
I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill
And all we gonna do
Is walk around to catch the thrill
On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo and walk down
42nd Street
You gonna be excited too
And you will feel the heat
We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I realize I missed a day
But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
I look around and see this face
What the hell have I lost my taste

Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

My head explodes my ears ring
I can't remember just where I've been
The last thing that I recall
I got lost in a deep black hole

Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
I grab my things and make a run
On my way out, another one
Would like to know before I stop
Did I make it or did I flop

Don't want to find out
Just want to get out, yeah!

Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I really had a blackout, baby

Don't want to find out
Just want to get out
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout

Just when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
This is the place where I belong
I really love to turn you on
I've got your sound still in my ears
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You give me your smile
A piece of your heart
You give me the feel I've been looking for
You give me your soul
Your innocent love
You are the one I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for
We're lost in a kiss
A moment in time
Forever young
Just forever, just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
It was love at first sight
All the way
When you came into my life
The world was not the same, oh no
Because your love has found it's way
Into my heart, oh yeah

You make me dream
By the look in your eyes
You give me the feel, I've been longing for
I've been longing for so long

Just forever in love

When you came into my life
It took my breath away
And was love at first sight
All the way


When you came into my lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
