Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up, our passion's spent
My heart's a tart, your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is bent
Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed

'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you

Sucker love, a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse
In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone

'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...

Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heavens sake
There's never been so much at stake
I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late

'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...

Like the naked leads the blind
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
Sucker love I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind
All alone in space and time
There's nothing here but what here's mine

Something borrowed, something blue
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
 
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who's dressed in leather
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather

A friend in need's a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she's pressed, she will undress
And then she's boxing clever
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever

Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning

A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed, which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather
A friend in need's a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever,

Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Day's dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning
Pure morning

A friend in need's a friend indeed

A friend who's dressed in leather
 
Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side

Tick - tock
Tick - tock
Tick - tock
Tick - tick
Tick - tick
Tick - tock

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You've never seen the lonely me at all

I
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I
Fall

Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
(Take the plan, spin it sideways)
Without you, I'm nothing at all
 
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill"

It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You want to hear about the deal I'm making?
You (be running up that hill)
You and me (be running up that hill)

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
There's a thunder in our hearts, baby
So much hate for the ones we love
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You (be running up that hill)
You and me (be running up that hill)
You and me won't be unhappy

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh

C'mon, baby, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

If I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

(If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill
If I only could
Be running up that hill)
 
Remember me when you're the one who's silver screened
Remember me when you're the one you always dreamed
Remember me whenever noses start to bleed
Remember me, special needs

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior

Remember me when you clinch your movie deal
And think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels
Remember me through flash photography and screams
Remember me, special dreams

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior

Remember me
Remember me

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior

Remember me
 
You are one of God's mistakes
You crying, tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in
Now, I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space

Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry
My, oh, my

You were mother nature's son
Someone to whom I could relate
Your needle and your damage done
Remains a sordid twist of fate
Now, I'm tryin' to wake you up
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause if I don't, we'll both end up
With just your song to say goodbye
My, oh, my
A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye
A song to say

Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry

It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye
 
Since we're feeling so anaesthetised
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
We're running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter's day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

Every step we take that's synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day

See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
Arouse and see you're mine
(See you at the bitter end)
Love has seen your run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
I'd whine out
(See you at the bitter end)
Love's reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
(See you at the bitter end)
In six weeks' time
The mess you left
Will end
 
I was alone, falling free
Trying my best not to forget
What happened to us, what happened to me
What happened as I let it slip
I was confused by the powers that be
Forgetting names and faces
Passers by, were looking at me
As if they could erase it
Baby...did you forget to take your meds?
Baby...did you forget to take your meds?
I was alone, staring over the ledge
Trying my best not to forget
All manner of joy, all manner of glee
And our one heroic pledge
How it mattered to us, how it mattered to me
And the consequences
I was confused, by the birds and the bees
Forgetting if I meant it
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
Baby..did you forget to take your meds?
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex and the drugs, and the complications
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
Baby..did you forget to take you meds?
I was alone, falling free, trying my best not to forget
 
Coming up beyond belief
On this coronary thief
More than just the leitmotif
More chaotic, no relief
I'll describe the way I feel
Weeping wounds that never heal
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around

I'll describe the way I feel
You're my new Achilles' heel
Can the savior be for real
Or are you just my seventh seal?

No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Just like I swallowed half my stash
And never ever wanna crash
No hesitation, no delay
You come on just like Special K
Now you're back with dope demand
I'm on sinking sand
Gravity, no escaping
Gravity
Gravity, no escaping
Not for free
I fall down, hit the ground
Make a heavy sound
Every time you seem to come around
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
No escaping gravity
Gravity
Gravity
Gravity
 
I hold an image of the ashtray girl
Of cigarette burns on my chest
I wrote a poem that described her world
And put our friendship to the test
And late at night
Whilst on all fours
She used to watch me kiss the floor
What's wrong with this picture?
What's wrong with this picture?

Farewell the ashtray girl
Forbidden snowflake
Beware this troubled world
Watch out for earthquakes
Goodbye to open sores
To broken semaphore
You know we miss her
We miss her picture

Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

Farewell the ashtray girl
Angelic fruitcake
Beware this troubled world
Control your intake
Goodbye to open sores
Goodbye and furthermore
You know we miss her
We miss her picture

Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

Hang on
Though we try
It's gone
Hang on
Though we try
It's gone

Sometimes it's fated
Disintegrated
For fear of growing old
Sometimes it's fated
Assassinated
For fear of growing old

Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
Can’t stop growing old
 
My computer thinks I'm gay
I threw that piece of junk away
On the Champs-Élysées
As I was walking home
This is my last communiqué
Down the superhighway
All that I have left to say in a single tome

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

If I could give it all away
Will it come back to me someday?
Like a needle in the hay or an expensive stone
But I got a reason to declaim
The applications are to blame
For all my sorrow and my pain
A feeling so alone

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

My computer thinks I'm gay
What's the difference anyway
When all the people do all day
Is stare into a phone

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

I'll never be there
I'll never be there
I'll never be there
I'll never be there
 
We were tight, but it falls apart as silver turns to blue
Waxing with a candlelight, and burning just for you
Allocate your sentiment, and stick it in a box
I've never been an extrovert, but I'm still breathing

Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)

With hindsight, I was more than blind, lost without a clue
Thought I was getting carat gold, and what I got was you
Stuck inside the circumstances, lonely at the top
I've always been an introvert
Happily bleeding

Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)

4 7 2 3 9 8 5 - I gotta breathe to stay alive
And 1 4 2 9 7 8 - feels like I'm gonna suffocate
14 16 22 - this skin that turns to blister blue
Shoulders toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees
Shoulders toes and knees,I'm 36 degrees
Shoulder toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees
Shoulders toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees
Shoulder toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees
Shoulder toes and knees, I'm 36 degrees
 
Never thought you'd make me perspire
Never thought I'd do you the same
Never thought I'd fill with desire
Never thought I'd feel so ashamed

Me and the dragon
Can chase all the pain away
So before I end my day
Remember
My sweet prince
You are the one
My sweet prince
You are the one

Never thought I'd have to retire
Never thought I'd have to abstain
Never thought all this could backfire
Close up the hole in my vein

Me and my valuable friend
Can fix all the pain away
So before I end my day
Remember
My sweet prince
You are the one
My sweet prince
You are the one
You are the one 

Never thought I'd get any higher
Never thought you'd fuck with my brain
Never thought all this could expire
Never thought you'd go break the chain

Me and you, baby
Used to flush all the pain away
So before I end my day
Remember
My sweet prince
You are the one
My sweet prince
You are the one
You are the one 
My sweet prince
My sweet prince
 
Bring me back to life
Never let me go
Your troubles and your heart strife
I saw them
Take me by the hand
As we cross through battlefields
Nobody understands
Cause there's nobody at the wheel

Beautiful James
I don’t wanna wake you
Beautiful James
I don't wanna wake you

Everybody lies one hundred times a day
The silence in your hard eyes
Is far too rare to give away
And it's exactly why I stay

Beautiful James
I don’t wanna wakе you
Beautiful James
I don't wanna wake you
(Don't wanna wakе you)
Beautiful James
(Don't wanna wake you)
I don't wanna wake you
(Don't wanna wake you)
Beautiful James
(Don't wanna wake you)
I don't wanna wake you

Though I may have to
I may have to
I may have to

Beautiful James
I don’t wanna wake you
(Don’t wanna wake you)
Beautiful James
(Don't wanna wake you)
I don’t wanna wake you
(Don't wanna wake you)
Beautiful James
(Don't wanna wake you)
I don't wanna wake you
 
The sea's evaporating
Though it comes as no surprise
These clouds we're seeing
They're explosions in the sky
It seems it's written
But we can't read between the line

Hush
It's okay
Dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soulmate dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soulmate dry your eye
Cause soulmates never die
This one world vision
Turns us in to compromise
What good's religion
When it's each other we despise
Damn the government
Damn their killing
Damn their lies

Soulmates never die
Never die
Soulmates never die
Never die...
Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
 
I know, you love the song but not the singer
I know, you've got me wrapped around your finger
I know, you want the sin without the sinner
I know
I know

I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster
I know, the last in line is always called a bastard
I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster
I know
I know
I know, you cut me loose in contradiction
I know, I'm all wrapped up in sweet attrition
I know, it's asking for your benediction
I know
I know

I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster
I know, the last in line is always called a bastard
I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster
I know
I know
I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster
I know, the last in line is always called a bastard
I know, the past will catch you up as you run faster
I know
I know
 
I love you more than any man
But something's getting in the way
I do you harm because I can
For the second time today
Victims we are not of happenstance
But you're a victim all the same
Stuck inside a circumstance
With your confusion and your blame

And when I get drunk
You take me home
And keep me safe
From harm
When I get drunk
You take me home

I ask you for another second chance
But then I drink it all away
And I get bellicose when you react
Full of frustration and dismay
I was so delicate when we began
So tender when I spoke your name
But now I'm nothing but a partisan
To my compulsion and my shame

And when I get drunk
You take me home
And keep me safe
From harm
When I get drunk
You take me home

You know, I'm grateful
I appreciate
But in fact, it's baleful
How I suck you dry
How I suck you dry
How I suck you dry
How I suck you
How I suck you dry
How I suck you dry
How I suck you dry

I love you more than any man
But I seem to lay it all to waste
I do you harm because I can
With a joke in questionable taste
I've such duplicity at my command
So I keep on lying to your face
Then I run away to wonderland
And disappear without trace

And when I get drunk
You take me home
And keep me safe
From harm
When I get drunk
You take me home

You know, I'm grateful
I appreciate
But, in fact, it's baleful
How I suck you dry
How I suck you dry
How I suck you dry
How I suck you
 
There are twenty years to go
And twenty ways to know
Who will wear
Who will wear the hat
There are twenty years to go
The best of all I hope
Enjoy the ride
The medicine show

And thems the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye

There are twenty years to go
The faithful and the low
The best of starts, the broken heart
The stone
There are twenty years to go
The punch-drunk and the blow
The worst of starts, the mercy part
The phone

And thems the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
And thems the breaks for we designer fakes
But it's you I take, cause you're the truth, not I

There are twenty years to go
A golden age I know
But all will pass, we'll end too fast
You know
There are twenty years to go
And many friends I hope
Though some may hold the rose, some hold the rope
And that's the end, and that's the start of it
That's the whole, and that's the part of it
That's the high, and that's the heart of it
That's the long, and that's the short of it
That's the best, and that's the test in it
That's the doubt, the doubt the trust in it
That's the sight, and that's the sound of it
That's the gift, and that's the trick in it
You're the truth, not I (X8)
 
One last thing before I shuffle off the planet
I will be the one to make you crawl
So I came down to wish you an unhappy birthday
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
One more thing before we start the final face off
I will be the one to watch you fall
So I came down to crash and burn your beggar's banquet
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
(And the dark is running after you, I swear it, the dark is running after you. The dark is after you...)
Someone call the ambulance, there's gonna be an accident
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
There is no running that can hide you
'Cause I can see in the dark
I'm coming up on infra-red
Forget your running, I will find you
I'll find you, I'll find you
 
I, I, I will battle for the sun, sun, sun
And I, I, I won't stop until I'm done, done, done
You, you, you are getting in the way, way, way
And I, I, I have nothing left to say, say, say
I, I, I, I, I will brush off all the dirt
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
And I, I, I, I, I will pretend it didn't hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
You, you, you, you, you are a black and heavy weight
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
And I, I, I, I, I will not participate pate
Pate, pate, pate, pate, pate, pate

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
I, I, I will battle for the sun, sun, sun, sun
Cause I, I, I have stared down the barrel of a gun
Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
No fun if you, you, you, you
You are a cheap and nasty fake
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
And I, I, I, I am the bones you couldn't break
Break, break, break, break, break, break, break

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
I, I, I will battle for the sun
