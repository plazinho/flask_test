If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need


I don't want to touch you too much, baby

It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies...
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites
 
Out of touch, out of reach, yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shaking to my knees

I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

Out of me, into you, yeah
You can hide, it's just a one way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide that's right, dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me

Huh!

Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch

I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done

(Photograph)
I don't want your (Photograph)
I don't need your (Photograph)
All I've got is a photograph

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

A wild ride, over stony ground
Such a lust for life, the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones, on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs, like a fire needs flame
Oh, I burn for you

I got to feel it in my blood, whoa, oh
I need your touch don't need your love, whoa, oh
And I want, and I need, and I lust, animal
And I want, and I need, and I lust, animal

I cry wolf, given mouth to mouth
Like a moving heartbeat, in the witching hour
I'm running with the wind, a shadow in the dust
And like the driving rain, hey, like the restless rust
I never sleep


Huh! Oh! Cry wolf baby, cry tough
Going to hunt you like an, uh, uh, animal
Going to take your love and run


And I want (And I want)
And I need (And I need)
And I lust (And I lust)

Sergeant Pepper and the band
Ziggy, Benny and the Jets
Ah, take a rocket

You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it
But are you getting it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come get it from me

(Give me all of your loving)
Every little bit
(Give me all that you got)
Every bit of it
(Every bit of your loving)

(Armageddon it)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Yes, Armageddon it)
Come on get it
Yeah
Do, do, do
Uh oh

You try coming on when you need some
But then you don't because you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while you're shaking your
And drive the pretty boys out of their heads
You got it
But are you getting it?
You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumping Jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back



Yeah, but are you getting it?
(Armageddon it)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Yes, Armageddon it)
Come on, Steve, get it, huh

Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, come on trigger the gun
Because the best is a yet to come
I say
(Because the best is yet to come)

Oh, are you getting it?
Oh, really getting it?
Yes, are you getting it?
Whoa, really getting it?

Come get it from me

(Never want it to stop)
Whoa
(Give me all of your loving)
 
Lady luck never smiles
So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill
On and on we rode the storm
The flame has died and the fire has gone
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago

Is anybody out there, anybody there?
Does anybody wonder, anybody care?
Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there and you really care
Because baby I'm not
Fooling, ah fooling, fooling, ah fooling
Won't you stay with me awhile?

Close your eyes don't run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just waking up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad


I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
 
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl, for the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall, but I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby, united we fall

Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I can't fight this flame
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby, like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know got to win this time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby...Crazy...Crazy

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
If you have a heart at all
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide
