All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day

All we do is lie and wait
All we do is, all we do is lie and wait
All we do is feel the fade
All we do is, all we do is feel the fade

I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground

All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day
All we do is play it safe
All we do is live inside a cage
All we do is play it safe
All we do, all we do

I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground

All we do is hide away
All we do is, all we do is hide away
[All we do is chase the day
All we do is, all we do is chase the day]
All I did was fail today
All I wanna be is whites in waves
All I did was fail today
All we do, all we do29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Step out into the sun
Skies above they radiate me
Lift up, carry the love
Do you know?
That I've been out of my mind
This slow life I'm waiting for you
To swing me all of your light
Do you know?

Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
Hi fi getting down low
Hide until tomorrow
Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lines
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Step out into the dark
Where were you when I was trying
To lift up, carry the love
Do you know?
That I've been closing my eyes
Love me slow, hallucinating
Swinging me all of your light
Do you know?

Since I've been walking solo
Dreaming you were back home
Hi fi getting down low
Hide until tomorrow
Come back into the good life
Lose these hazy love lines
I've been chasing my mind
Lonely in the cold nights
Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Hold me close when it's over
Life goes slow loving sober
Feel my bones getting older
Sadness grows when you go
'Cause I am one step heavy and two steps high
Holding steady with you by my side
One step heavy and two steps high
Two steps high

Cause I'm kicking up stones without you
Can't pick up the phone without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you

Without you
Without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you
And I'm digging down holes without you
Can't be on my own without you
I'm a little bit lost without you
Without you18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones
Looser we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three

And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Your name I’ll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones
Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one, two, three

And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are from the start
Won't you dance with me?
Make a spark, break the dark
Find a light with me
Who we are chasing stars
Won't you dance with me?
Won't you dance with me?

And don’t you stop the music
Get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a place and lose it
You can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it'

Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it (all), (we gotta) lose it, lose it (all)
We gotta lose it
Lose it (all), (we gotta) lose it, lose it (all)
We gotta lose it
Move your feet and feel it in the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment, let your body be

I know it hurts sometimes but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
But you'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

I know your hope is heavy but
You'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
And I know you feel like everything
Is fallen to the wind
But don't you let the thunder in
'Cause I know you'll get over it
So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

You fell down by the wayside
Love-locked in an overflow
And you threw stones at the starlight
As I stood on the sideline telling you
That I get that you're lonely
And I see that you feel alone
But I'll hide in your heartbeat
I'll be there for you, you know

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sat back with the window down
Eighty an hour and the radio loud
The same songs with the same old rhymes
Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights

But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

Count stacks of the routine lies
Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there’s a place I’d rather be
And I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you

See, I remember all the times you made me covered in crazy
I can’t forget about the way you played me
Like I was never gonna change your world
It ended long ago, so please just let me go
It ended long ago, so please just let me go

Cause loving you, loving you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you leaves me hurt
All I do, all I do is get burned
Loving you, loving you
I cannot be loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
All I do, all I do
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Lay down your slow
Come settle down, settle down
Let loose your glow
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Beat, beat, beat

Warm, unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat, beat

Give me one drop, I can feel you
Make me lose control
We'll be walking, on the water
When we're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat (falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me (found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream (we're moving), in a technicolour beat
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream (we're moving), in a technicolour beat

I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
Down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
I'm ready to climb this mountain inside
Impossible heights

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Here with me

I'm ready to go, I’m ready to go
Can't do it alone, can’t do it alone
I’m ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can’t do it alone, can't do it alone
I’m ready to hope, swing me out of the low
Wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
I’m ready to fly, uncover the light
Impossible heights
Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
I need you right here with me
Here with me

(Whoa)
(Woo-oa)
(Woo-oo)

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me

Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
Before I found you

Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife
I'm living ultralife

Turn down the voice inside my head
Cos heaven only knows why we feel this emptiness
But I will climb out, find another view
Now I've found you
Days passed slowly, lost and low
You gave me hope and now there's only

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)

(Ultralife with me)
Found me on a basement floor (Ultralife with me)
Back when I had lost it all (Ultralife with me)
Told me what the fight was for (Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up no more (Ultralife with me)
You elevate the life in me (Ultralife with me)
Illuminate the in-between (Ultralife with me)
Forever gonna feel this free (Ultralife with me)
And I'm not giving up now
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Lights out solo in the blue
But now I've found you

Blood running in my veins
I've never been here before
And I got love falling like the rain
I never could've asked for more
I got so much soul inside my bones
Take a look at me now
I'm young, forever in the sun
Ever since you came, I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
Oh, we're living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me, oh)
We're living ultralife

Before you came round, my heart would never beat much faster
Before you came round, I was ready to slow down
Before you came round, I was heading for a small disaster
Before you came round, I was ready to blow me down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

Before I was found, I felt like I could drain the ocean
Before I was found, I didn't want to breathe out
Now my soul beats a sound, loud enough to quiet the thunder
A love with no doubt, and now I'm never gonna slow down
Never gonna slow down

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
And we will talk with our head in the clouds
And we will walk with our feet on the ground
On the ground, on the ground, on the ground

Let it go, paint my body gold
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher
Let it go, paint my body gold
We can go, until the morning glow
We can go higher and higher and higher

(And we will walk with our feet on the ground)
Let it go, paint my body gold
(And we will talk with our head in the clouds)
Take our bodies higher and higher and higher
(And we will walk with our feet on the ground)
We can go, until the morning glow
(And we will talk)
We can go higher and higher and higher10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I'll walk the world for you
Doing it right, doing it right
Seconds, minutes, hours, lifetimes
Doing it right, doing it right
I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right

Hands up for a miracle
Up high for a miracle
Oh the smoke don’t stop but we let it go
But we let it go on and on
Flash back to a year ago
Count stacks, fifty-two ago
All the hope, drop down like a domino
But we let it go on and on

Will someone take a ride with me?
Back to the world where we can see
Echo strong, river deep
Concrete hazy
Won’t you take a ride with me?
Take a ride with me
It’s easy come never go
Please make way for telephones
Call me crazy, call me slow
Go hang up but
Won’t you take a ride with me?
Come on take a ride with me

'Cause I found love in you
Doing it right, doing it right
I’ll walk the world for you

Will someone take a ride with me?
Back to the planet sanity
Desert plain, ocean wave
Techno crazy
Won’t you take a ride with me?
Take a ride with me
It’s easy come, never go
Please make way for climaphobes
Two degrees, you’re spilling seas
Toupée queen
Oh, won’t you take a ride with me?
Come on take a ride with me

Swing sweet light this earth of mine

I'm getting high, getting high
Getting high on humans

Sitting in the next seat, dead heat summer
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide

And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy

'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide

And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy

'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans

We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop, we won't stop
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop, no, we won't stop
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop lighting our minds up
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop lighting our minds up
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans

You got diamonds in your eyes tonight
Throwing fire, trying to make it right
You’re getting higher than the ceiling lights
And falling hard enough to lose the fight

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

There’s a human in your heart of hearts
Hiding true colours made you fall apart
In the mirror you’re a work of art
But this is real life, real life

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose
Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

Give me neon lights, roll me paper heights
I can feel the dice, cooling me
See the plastic life through my bloodshot eyes
I am wild alive, I am wild alive

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You got that throne
Baby you got that throne
That golden majestic glow
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I got that hope
Ready electric go, go
Super volcano flow
Delight, delight, delight, delight

And I could hold you endlessly
Ultralife just you and me
Oh my heart is aching
Feel my body breaking
There's magic in the way you move
Stop the world it's only you
Oh my heart is waking
'Cause I could be your one and only

We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until we're too bright, all night, all night
Yeah, we can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until we're too bright, all night, all night

Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I got that taste
Hope in a one night blaze
That animalistic chase (da dee, da de)

Made a home in a basement
Didn't think that I'd need the light
'Cause all these plans I've been making
Get me out of here in time
But it's always two steps backwards
Too much gravity to feel the highs
And all these plans I've been chasing
Getting caught up and wasted

I don't know where the money goes
I get broke as the city glows
Shines bright as I sink down low
Down low

But I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know?
Gonna build a paper plane to float to you
You know, don't you know?
We'll be scraping the skies with our fingertips
Screaming "This is the life, we were born for this"
See I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I've got a hope in the headlights
Stood still but I'm feeling fine
'Cause all these plans I've been making
Will get me out of here in time
But it's always two steps backwards
Too much gravity to feel the highs
And all these plans I've been chasing
Getting caught up and wasted

I don't know where the money goes
I get broke as the city glows
Shines bright as I sink down low
Down low

What a way to wake up
Feeling like I'm overexposed
I guess it’s kind of messed up
That I just wanna keep myself closed

Nothing hurts like being blindsided by love
Nothing hurts like thinking I'm not good enough

I wish I never met you
But it's a little too late
I wish I never met you
But it’s a little too late
You left me with these issues that I just can't seem to shake
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late
Yeah, it's a little too late
It's a little too late

When I was a young one
Never saw a cloud in the sky
But now I'm coming undone
Staring at myself, wondering why
Nothing hurts like being blindsided by love
Nothing hurts like thinking I'm not good enough

I wish I never met you
But it's a little too late
I wish I never met you, oh
But it’s a little too late
You left me with these issues that I just can’t seem to shake
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late
Yeah, it’s a little too late
Yeah, it's a little
It's a little too late

I cry like a river
Fist fight with the mirror
I guess life ain't all glitter
I wish I never met you
It takes time to get bigger
Shine bright, find a rhythm
And I’ll try not be bitter

I just wish I never met you
But it's a little too late
Yeah, I wish I never met you
Yeah, it's a little too late
I wish I never met you
But it's a little too late
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late
You left me with these issues that I just can't seem to shake
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late

You left me with these issues that I just can't seem to shake
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Beyond the oceansize, I'm unaware
Locked out the other side
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
They said the boat had sailed
I'd left them bare
Oh how the wind would wail
Like I was never there
Like I was never there

Oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

Beyond the oceansize, I'm unaware
Locked out the other side
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
I lost my only space
To empty stares
Oh how the light would change
Like I was never there
Like I was never there
Oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
And oh my friends
I am ready
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends

And I can’t forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can’t forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can’t forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
All of the love
And I can’t forget it
All of the love
All of the love
As we stood tall together
All of the love
And oh my friends
I am heavy
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends
And oh my friends
I am ready
Can I beat within your heart?
Can I bleed within your love?
Oh my friends4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Never thought I'd be happy
Never thought I'd be happy

I didn't think that I'd see you here tonight
But there's something kinda nice about it
It's been a year since you gave me back my love
And I wonder how you've been without it

You're holding someone close
Should hurt, somehow it don't
I guess that's how I know I've finally let you go

I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like you're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new

Never thought I'd be happy
Never thought I'd be happy

Spent all my weekends pretending I was fine
Just to get you out my mind for an evening (For an evening)
I used to wish you would never find the one
But it's good to see you loved, let's call it even
You're holding someone close
Should hurt, somehow it don't
I guess that's how I know I've finally let you go

I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like
You're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new

So many nights of barely sleeping
Wide awake and dreaming
I wanted you back (I wanted you back)
It's clear we're good without each other
Dancing with another
It's better like that

I never thought I'd be happy
Never thought I'd be happy
With somebody else, it's like
You're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like you're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody newEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
They're building towers that are high enough to see the clouds
Yet it don't bother me
The elevator's working overtime up and down
Yet it don't bother me

'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self deep within
'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self, a higher self

And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope

They're building aeroplanes faster than the speed of light
Yet it don't bother me
The endless cities multiplying out oceansize
Yet it don't bother me

'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self deep within
'Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self, a higher self
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
'Cause there is something more than everything
So feel the love and let it in
'Cause I know we need a little heart hope


And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
'Cause there is something more than everything
So feel the love and let it in
'Cause I know we need a little heart hope4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Standing on the world outside
Caught up in a love landslide
Stuck still, colour blind
Hoping for a black and white

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?
My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?

Walking on the clouds unknown
Drop down oh I will never go, never go, never go
Floating like gravity has grown
Reach down to a deep deep hole, deep hole, deep deep hole

Are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna be mine?
I feel it falling from the skies above
Are you gonna be mine?
My wave, my shark, my demon in the dark
The blue tide pulling me under
Or are you my soul, my heart, pull everything apart?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Woa oh oh, are you gonna, are you gonna be my love?
Standing on the world outside
I’m a shark in a love landslide14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hanging on a silver string
All the love that we could’ve been
Summer fading out the spring
Feel the warmth underneath your wings
And I will never let you go
All the words you want to scream
Take my heart slowly out of me
Forever falling in a dream
All the love that we could’ve been

I never get high when you’re feeling low
I’m pulling down stars just to make you glow
It’s just the way you are when you’re overgrown
And in the middle of the night when you’re on your own
I’m chasing down light in the indigo
It’s just the way you are when you’re overgrown
And I will never let you go
And I will never let you go

Promise I will never run
Catching fire, let the light become
Shallow edges left of sun
Feel the heat, hold it in your lungs
Never could’ve loved you more
By your side in a quiet roar
This is what my hope is for
Watch you float when the water’s gone
I never get high when you’re feeling low
I’m pulling down stars just to make you glow
It’s just the way you are when you’re overgrown
And in the middle of the night when you’re on your own
I’m chasing down light in the indigo
It’s just the way you are when you’re overgrown
And I will never let you go
No I will never let you go

Did I, did I, did I do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I do you right?
Did I, did I, did I, do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I, did I, did I?
Did I, did I, did I do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I do you right?
Did I, did I, did I, do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I, did I, did I?
Did I, did I, did I do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I do you right?
Did I, did I, did I, do you wrong?
Did I, did I, did I?
And I will never let you go

I never get high when you’re feeling low
I’m pulling down stars just to make you glow
It’s just the way you are when you’re overgrown
And in the middle of the night when you’re on your own
I’m chasing down light in the indigo
It’s just the way you are when you’re overgrown
And I will never let you go
And I will never let you go
And I will never let you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
