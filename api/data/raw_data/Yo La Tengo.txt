When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off?

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always, but it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I stare into space
I'm looking for you
And I can see you
At times
I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around
See the kaleidoscope girl
In the doorway
She's looking my way
At times
I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around
Washing the dirt from your face
I'm looking for you
And I still miss you
At times
I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I remember a summer's day
I remember walking up to you
I remember my face turned red
And I remember staring at my feet
I remember before we met
I remember sitting next to you
And I remember pretending I wasn't looking

So try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might, try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

I remember your old guitar
I remember, I can't explain
I remember the way it looked around your neck
And I remember the day it broke
I remember the song you sang
I remember the way you look tonight
And I remember the way it made me feel
We'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might we'll try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

You'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

Yeah, we're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Do you know how I feel?
How I feel about you
Do you know this is real?
How I feel around you
When I see you look at me
I'm not sure of anything
All I know is when you smile
I believe in everything
Do you know how I dream?
How I dream about you
Do you know how I feel?
Do you know?
Do you know how I feel?
How I feel about you
Doesn't take much to tell
That I love, oh, I
Everyone is here
But you're nowhere near
No, you're nowhere near
No, you're nowhere near5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I followed you foolishly
You were at a smoky bar, you were out till three
Sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four
Couldn't wait for you all night
So I broke the door
I was going to spend the night, could have been okay
We were going to talk all night till I went away
Remember how you used to say, can't stay up late
A minute later and we're older now, I can't stay awake
I'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet
I remember that rusty car, like it was yesterday
Saw my brother driving by the other day
Wished that I'd go out to him, but he drove away
Saw my sister standing there accepting blame
Then I thought of how nothing ever feels the same
Another day come and gone
Don't think I can ever sing that song
Little secrets we bring along
I'm taking my time trailing behind
I thought of you
Another day come and gone
Don't think I can ever sing that song
Little secrets we bring along
Today is the day, today is the day
I think of you
Another day come and gone
Don't think I want to sing that song
It's always trouble that makes you strong
Today is the day, today is the day
I think of you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
"We proudly welcome Tony Orlando"
The state fair marquee reads
Inside 1,000 people with yellow ribbons sing
And clap on one and three

Watch him burn
He's dropping to his knees
Watch him burn
A medley, hits from Grease
Watch him burn
He never fails to please

Meanwhile in Tahoe, outside Casa Tony
Wetting rags in gasoline
A jealous Frankie Valli says, "Dawn, I want you back"
Lights a match and counts to three

Watch it burn
Reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn
Acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn
Humming "Sherry," splits the scene
Watch it burn
Reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn
Acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn
Humming "Sherry," splits the scene

We're sorry to inform you
Tony Orlando has been postponedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Since you left me I've been out with other guys
But they don't see the love light shining in my eyes
And when they want to kiss goodnight
I just can't seem to do it right
My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you
Cause when I think that someone else has won my heart
I find it's only wishful thinking on my part
And there's just nothing I can do
To get that feeling I had with you
My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you
I don't know just what my friends are telling you
But if they say I'm doin fine, it's just not true
I may run with the crowd and stay out late
But baby let me set you straight
My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you
My heart's not in it, oh no1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What's the matter?
Why don't you answer?
What's the matter with me?
Cause it's so hard to be
Free and easy
We'll disappear completely
Hardly as I've known it's glad
Your heart is broken
And the doors are open
As you're hoping to be
There's brighter places to see
Hands need warming
Early in the morning
Hardly as I've known
A surprise
No, don't warn me
I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't
Take long
And I know, you know
It makes me sigh
I do believe
In love
No, don't warn me
I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't
Take long
And I know, you know
It makes me sigh
I do believe, I do believe
Another season
But the same old feelings
Another reason to be
I'm tired of aching
The summer's what you make it
But I'll believe what I want to believe3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
From a sugarcube

Try to be more assured
Try to be more right there
Try to be less uptight
Try to be more aware

Whatever you want from me
Is what I want to do for you
Sweeter than a drop of blood
On a sugarcube

And though I like to act the part of being tough
I crumble like a sugarcube
For you

Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I will try
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
Squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcubeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Late at night gazing out into the late at night
I see deep in the world 'til I open my eyes
Every day brakes screech outside my window
Those crashing cars never seem to collide

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
Catch the stars and watch as they go by

I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
It blows my mind

Every day I'm drawn to my window
I can hear it if I open my eyes
Sometimes flashing lights seem so familiar
I know I've seen them circling me at night

I've been sending signals into outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
It blows my mind
Every day the restlessness takes over me
I can see it as I'm closing my eyes

I've been sending signals into outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
I've been getting messages from outer space
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
They spiral like a finger in the sky
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You tell me summer's here
And the time is wrong
You tell me winter's here
And your days are getting long

Tears are in your eyes
Tonight

You tell me that you haven't
Slept in days
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired
Anyway

Tears are in your eyes
Tonight
Tears are in your eyes
Every night

Although you don't believe me, you are strong
Darkness always turns into the dawn
And you won't even remember this for long
When it ends all right
Please tell me how you'll know tomorrow
Staring at your shoes

Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Tonight1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
