Rumor spreadin' 'round in that Texas town
About that shack outside La Grange
And you know what I'm talkin' about
Just let me know if you wanna go
To that home out on the range
They gotta lotta nice girls
Have mercy
A-haw haw haw-haw
Heh, a-haw haw haw

Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
And the ten to get yourself in
A hmm, hmm
And I hear it's tight most every night
But now I might be mistaken
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Have mercy
 
Yeah

Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (Black tie)
I don't need a reason why

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out, I'm gonna do you in

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Uh-huh

Top coat, top hat
And I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white glove
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Would you get behind them
If you could only find them?

Girl, you got it right

Shit I got to have her
The girl is alright

Cause what you got is oh, so sweet
You got to make it hot

All your hugs and kisses too

Well, I was rolling down the road
In some cold blue steel
I had a blues man on the back
And a beautician at the wheel
We going downtown
In the middle of the night
We laughing and I'm joking
And we feeling alright

Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide

Easing down the highway
In a new Cadillac
I had a fine fox in front
I had three more in the back
They sporting short dresses
Wearing spike-heel shoes
They smoking Lucky Strikes
And wearing nylons too

Cause we bad, we're nationwide
Yeah we bad, we're nationwide


Well, I was moving down the road
In my V-8 Ford
I had a shine on my boots
I had my sideburns lowered
With my New York brim
And my gold tooth displayed
Nobody give me trouble
Cause they know I got it made

I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Well, I'm bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, I'm nationwide, yeah, yeah
 
When you wake up in the morning
And the light is hurt your head
The first thing you do
When you get up out of bed
Is hit that streets a-runnin'
And try to beat the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Spied a little thing and
I followed her all night
In a funky fine Levi's and her
Sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut
That was sweet as molasses
But what really knocked
Me out was her cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah


Now go out and get yourself
Some thick black frames
With the glass so dark
They won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you
Cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades
And cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
 
Just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
Said, I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
If you believe like working hard all day
Just step in my shoes and take my pay

I was born my papa's son
When I hit the ground I was on the run
I had one glad hand and the other behind
You can have yours, just give me mine
When the hound dog barking
In the black of the night
Stick my hand in my pocket
Everything's all right


I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
Said, black sheep black
Do you got some wool?
Yes, I do man, my bag is full
It's the root of evil and you know the rest
But it's way ahead of what's second best
 
She's really upset with me again
I didn't give her what she likes
I don't know what to tell her
Don't know what to say
Everything got funky last night

She was really bombed
And I was really blown away
And when I asked her what she wanted
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace

She gets a charge out of being so weird
Digs getting downright strange
But I can keep a handle on anything
Just this side of deranged

She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace


She is so tough
And pure as the driven slush
And that's not jewelry she's talking 'bout
It really don't cost that much

She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
