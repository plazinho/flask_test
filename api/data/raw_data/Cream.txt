In a white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves
You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

It’s getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I’ll soon be with you, my love
To give you my dull surprise
I’ll be with you, darling, soon
I’ll be with you when the stars start falling

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Take me, if you please"

I went down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside


Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside


You can run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads believe I'm sinking down

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now, what you gonna do?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

Strange brew
Strange brew

Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Yes, before they bring the curtain down, woo-ooh

Get up, get up, get up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You thought the leaden winter
Would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer
To the violence of the sun

And the colors of the sea
Bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind
The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes
Run lauging through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
(ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...)
(x9)
Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
I, I, I, I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I... I...4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me at night
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone
You've got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard

Running to me a-cryin', when he throws you out
Running to me a-cryin', on your own again
You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
But the picture has a mustache

You're comin' to me
With that soulful look on your face
Coming lookin' like you've
Never ever done one wrong thing


You're comin' to me
With that soulful look on your face
You're comin' lookin' like you've
Never ever done one wrong thing
So many fantastic colors, I feel in a wonderland
Many fantastic colors, makes me feel so good
You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
Got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beardEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me

And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?

I can hear all the cries of the city
No time for pity
For a growing tree
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me

And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
One summer day she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

All the summer working on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard
Gonna catch me a freight train
Going to leave this town
Work done got too hard
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car
Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car
I want to just show you
What my politics are

I'm a political man
And I practice what I preach
I'm a political man
And I practice what I preach
So don't deny me, baby
Not while you're in my reach

I support the left
Though I'm leaning, leaning to the right
I support the left
Though I'm leaning to the right
But I'm just not there
When it's coming to a fight

Hey now, baby
Get into my big black car

Could fill spoons full of diamonds
Could fill spoons full of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Will satisfy my soul
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Could fill spoons full of coffee
Could fill spoons full of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Is that enough for me?
Men lies about it
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies about it
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Could fill spoons full of water
Save them from the desert sands
But a little spoon of your forty-five
Saved you from another man
Men lies
Some of them cries about it
Some of them dies
Everything's a-fightin' about it
Everything's a-cryin' about it
Everything's a-diein' about it
Everything's a-cryin' about it
Everything's a-liein' about it
Little old, little old spoonful
Die'n about it
Cryin about it
That spoon, that spoon
Little old, little old spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
Everything's a-diein' about it1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you lose your money
Great God, don't lose your mind
If you lose your money
Great God, don't lose your mind
And if you lose your woman
Please don't fool with mine

I'm gonna buy me a bulldog
Watch my lady whilst I sleep
I'm gonna buy me a bulldog
Watch my lady whilst I sleep
'Cause women these days
They're so doggone crooked
That they might make off 'fore day creep

Well, you can't watch your wife
And your outside woman too
You know you can't watch your wife
And your outside women's too
'Cause when you're out with your woman
Your wife will be at home
Cooking your food, doing your dirt
Buddy, what're you trying to do?

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble's my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

More wine and women is all I crave
Big bad women gonna carry me to my grave

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble's been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Pressed rat and warthog have closed down their shop
They didn't want to; 'twas all they had got
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat
And pressed rat's collection of doglegs and feet
Sadly, they left, telling no one goodbye
Pressed rat wore red jodhpurs, warthog a striped tie
Between them, they carried a three-legged sack
Went straight round the corner and never came back
Pressed rat and warthog have closed down their shop
The bad captain madman had told them to stop
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat
And pressed rat's collection of doglegs and feet
The bad captain madman had ordered their fate
He laughed and stomped off with a nautical gait
The gate turned into a deroga tree
And his peg leg got woodworm and broke into three
Pressed rat and warthog have closed down their shop
They didn't want to; 'twas all they had got
Selling atonal apples, amplified heat
And pressed rat's collection of doglegs and feet1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Gonna build myself a castle
High up in the clouds
There'll be skies outside my window
Lose these streets and crowds

Dance the night away

Will find myself an ocean
Sail into the blue
Live with golden swordfish
Forget the time of you

Dance the night away

Dance myself to nothing
Vanish from this place
Gonna turn myself to shadow
So I can see your face

Dance the night awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Are we rollin'? A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four...

A mother was washing her baby one night
The youngest of ten and a delicate mite
The mother was poor, and the baby was thin
Twas naught but an skellington covered with skin
The mother turned 'round for a soap off the rack
She was only a moment, but a-when she turned back
Her baby had gone and in anguish she cried
"Oh, where 'as my baby gone?" The angels replied
"Oh, your baby has gone down the plug-'ole
Oh, your baby has gone down the plug
The poor little thing was so skinny and thin
He should 'ave been washed in a jug, in a jug
Your baby is perfectly happy
He won't need a bath anymore
He's a-muckin' about with the angels above
Not lost, but gone before"

Thank you
Do you wanna do it again?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Don't take the wrong direction passing through
Instead of deep reflection of what's true
For it's a combination of judgments made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through

No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition

Early rising every day
You must be enterprising in your way
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun
Life would be one disaster all the way through

No relaxation, no conversation, no variation
In a very dark blue, blue condition

Don't take the wrong direction passing through
Instead of deep reflection of what's true
For it's a combination of judgements made by you
That cause a deep dejection all the way through
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation

Upon this street where time has died
The golden treat you never tried
In times of old, in days gone by
If I could catch your dancing eye
It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah
The street is cold, its trees are gone
The story's told the dark has won
Once we set sail to catch a star
We had to fail, it was too far
It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams
I felt the wind shout like a drum
You said, "My friend, love's end has come"
It couldn't last, had to stop
You drained it all to the last drop
It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah
On this dark street, the sun is black
The winter life is coming back
On this dark street, it's cold inside
There's no retreat from time that's died
It was on the way
On the road to dreams
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
