In a white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves
You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
 
It’s getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
I’ll soon be with you, my love
To give you my dull surprise
I’ll be with you, darling, soon
I’ll be with you when the stars start falling

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love


I’m with you, my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes, I’m with you, my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you, darling, now
I’ll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up

I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love
 
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Take me, if you please"

I went down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside


Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside


You can run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads believe I'm sinking down

Uh, Eric Clapton lead, uh, vocal
 
Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now, what you gonna do?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you


On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you
 
Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Yes, before they bring the curtain down, woo-ooh

Get up, get up, get up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle
 
You thought the leaden winter
Would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer
To the violence of the sun

And the colors of the sea
Bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes
Run lauging through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter
 
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
(ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...)
(x9)
Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
I, I, I, I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I... I...
 
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me at night
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone
You've got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard

Running to me a-cryin', when he throws you out
Running to me a-cryin', on your own again
You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
But the picture has a mustache

You're comin' to me
With that soulful look on your face
Coming lookin' like you've
Never ever done one wrong thing


You're comin' to me
With that soulful look on your face
You're comin' lookin' like you've
Never ever done one wrong thing

So many fantastic colors, I feel in a wonderland
Many fantastic colors, makes me feel so good
You've got that pure feel
Such good responses
Got that rainbow feel
But the rainbow has a beard
 
Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me

And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?

I can hear all the cries of the city
No time for pity
For a growing tree
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me


Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me

And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me
 
One summer day she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

All the summer working on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard
Gonna catch me a freight train
Going to leave this town
Work done got too hard
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
