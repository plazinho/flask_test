One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad

But "got it" just don't get it till there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)

Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times150EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

Yuh
Uh-huh
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
(Y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

Yeah

Now is the time to get on—like Spike Lee said, "Get on the Bus"
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping—it's a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack-man
Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (Real)
You can go on and chill out and still build
Let your paper stack 'stead of going into overkill
And pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch
Yeah
Yuh, yuh (Yeah)
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from "home of the brave," with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope like the words "maybe," "if," or "probably"
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift—I'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?
Naww, so don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, "Aquemini": another Black experience
Okay

Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-Black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
G—Get back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
You 'ear that? You can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (Quit)
Because "Aquemini" is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, André Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
"André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends"
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
Master: Finally, Igor! We've done it, we've done it!
Igor: Yes, master! Yes, master!
Master: Igor, we've done it!
Both: Uh-oh

Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol, so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Whoo!)
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I'll be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ha!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should've held back, but you throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty-pat rappers trying to get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, ha!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

Bombs over Baghdad!
Bombs over Baghdad!
Bombs over Baghdad!

Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James

Dickie shorts, Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out, here come the folk—"Damn"
Oh, Lord


As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set It Off" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
"Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!"
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—"Wham! Wham!"
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, "Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like "Freeze!" We making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

Check it, a-one-two, a-one
"Two dope niggas in the Cadillac," they call us
Went from "Player's Ball" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say "motherfuck that playin'", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now"
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone!
Like this, East Point and we gone
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something "Hey, man, you remember me from school?"
"No, not really"
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you41EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down
But us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now, say

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, "Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'"
That's one to live or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
André, got to her station, here's my destination she got off the bus The conversation lingered in my head for hours took a shower Kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, "It's weak" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, "Them niggas earned that crown", but until then
Ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Say ah ha, hush that fuss

Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate you, playa
I'm dicking the ho down—never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty—that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though—maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck; I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too"
She said she understood and everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now

It's like that, now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)
It's like that now, t's like that now
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha... Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning, yawning, dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain, and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back staring at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, "What you wanna be?" She said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong (Man)
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
Grandmama: Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!
Keisha: Ugh, alright
Child 1: Grandmama, what’s all that noise?
Child 2: I’m scared
Grandmama: Baby, don’t be scared. It's gonna be alright. It’s just the Lord doin' His work, okay?33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "Timber!" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move, wooo

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me
(Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me out of my, out of my mind
Out my mind, ooooh, baby
If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

I like the way you move (I like the way you move)

Yeah, yeah it goes like this right here
Like uh, niggas always be hollering "peace"
You know what I'm saying, "peace my brother"
Peace this, peace that, you know what I'm saying but
Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind
Niggas try to get a piece of mine
So I gotta grab my piece
It's the return of the gangster, thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow that run up in your crib
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit, get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that think you soft and say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed
Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin', get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
Seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass
Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?
When y'all gon' break up? When y'all gon' wake up?
Nigga I'm feelin' better than ever what's wrong with you
You get down!
Gangsta (it's the return, it's the return–turn–turn–turn)
Ooh (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn, it's the return, return)
Gangsta (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn)
Ooh (It's the return, it's the return–turn–turn)

Man, a nigga don't want no trouble
A playa just want to kick back with my gators off
And watch my lil' girl blow bubbles
But still ready to rhyme, standing my ground never back down
Willin' to rob steal and kill any thang that threatens mine
But good luck couldn't be bought, see
Many a fights had to be fought, G
For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon' be the first nigga we attack
Don't want that, but it comes though, most of the time when you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon' stick up for
Each other, like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin' punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors
We ain't Club Nouveau
Gangsta (it's the return, it's the return–turn–turn–turn)
Ooh (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn, it's the return, return)
Gangsta (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn)
Ooh (It's the return, it's the return–turn–turn)

Man let me hit that
You gon' pass that?
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm full as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
