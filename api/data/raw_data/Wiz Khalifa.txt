It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)
Uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you

Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho

So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces

And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is

You be anything you want
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
It don't stop here nigga

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your word so never break it
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it
Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good Cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

You known I’m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we owners
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in the hall
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
All we do is get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Grab a lighter uh huh, something I can steam uh huh
Bong rip uh huh, make sure its clean uh huh
Smoke sesh uh huh, nigga what you mean uh huh
In my car uh huh, cruising down the street uh huh
So stoned I'mm need something to eat uh huh
No tray uh huh, ashes on my seat uh huh
Highed up uh huh, Taylors on my feet uh huh
Cloud 9 uh huh, going through my mind uh huh
Take a toke uh huh, hold it 'til you choke huh uh
Moving forward uh huh, cruising on my board uh huh
Still got more uh huh, burn it til it’s short uh huh

And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(Higher than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating)
And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(High than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be higher than a motherfucker)

High up and we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
Higher then we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling

Tell that nigga use a grinder for that weed uh huh
And tell him "roll another joint don't fall asleep" uh huh
Smoke peace uh huh, pipe like a chief uh huh
Heard you got a cheaper price for that reefer huh
What you need? Uh huh, never find a seed uh huh
Take a dab uh huh, straight THC uh huh
For the highest in the room look at me uh huh
Somewhere in the clouds that's where we wanna be uh huh
Got you shook uh uh, not just for the look uh huh
Half the day uh huh, rolled the whole book uh huh
Drive slow uh huh, blow it by the O uh huh
Eyes low uh huh, everybody know it damn

(And I be floating)
And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(Higher than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating)
I get so high
Fuck around and never come down
(and I be higher than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(and I be higher than a motherfucker)

Higher then we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
Higher then we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling

Growing up uh huh, never gave a fuck uh huh
Pulling out the 62 and showing up uh huh
Twenty-six, guess that mean I'm growing up uh huh
Pouring up uh huh, all my niggas rolling up
Making sure that...

And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(Higher than a motherfucker)
I get so high, I get so high
(And I be floating)
And I get so high, fuck around and never come down
(and I be higher than a motherfucker)

We're rolling, rolling, rolling
Higher then we're floating
Don't know where we're going
Night until the morning
We're rolling, rolling, rolling
 
I'm gettin' high as fuck in this, trippy niggas
Must be some real shit though
Let's get it, hear we go
I looked in the mirror today
And seen the realest nigga I ever met in my life
Hahahahaha, uhh

I done smoked weed where they said I can't
Got rich when they said I can't
Got high and got on the plane
And brought all my niggas when they said I can't
Went shopping places they said I can't
Bought some shit that they said I can't
Jumped on the road and did all them shows
Cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't
Went hard in places they said I can't
Promoters call and try and set up dates
Bought the car with that yellow paint
Go to parties now and they set up drinks
And it's first class, so I'm private plane
Nudie jeans with my get up mane
Rolling papers and Mary Jane
I made 11 mil' and I'm still the same

What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, mane?
All of this and I'm still the mane
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business mane
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest mane

Out of all these niggas, they callin' me the realest
Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling
Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million
Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'
Gold Rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don
Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm
Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar
Everything Hermes, Chanel seats in the car
When you all know them fuck niggas start hatin'
Talkin' 'bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'
When you getting rich, they doubt you, but shout-out my gang
And my brother Will cause I couldn't do this without you, fo' real

What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, mane?
All of this and I'm still the mane
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business mane
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest mane

18 racks, I pay the dough, to send them goons straight to ya door
To show you niggas what's real, and let you meet that .44
Run your mouth, you in the trunk
Glock to your head, nowhere to run
Catch you niggas when you by yourself
We gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums
Boat load, no babbage, good drank, I'm famished
Bank account outlandish, big real estate, sittin' on land, bitch
Niggas out there tryna test me, I put the AK where his chest be
Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas
No security, bitch, so don't test me
Double cup full, I be sippin' up
Mob niggas, man, real criminals
If a nigga find you, they gon' hit ya up
With a Bin Laden chopper that'll split ya up
All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us
They gon' swallow this nut, no spittin' up
Your niggas get murked, your niggas in jail
My team gettin' money stay filled with drugs

What's with all these niggas and their feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money, I'm a business man
Out of all these niggas, I'm the realest man
What's with all these niggas and their feelings, mane?
All of this and I'm still the mane

I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
I'm the realest mane, I'm the realest mane
 
Say baby, I'ma wait up for you
I'ma have my way with your body
And when I’m done touching you
I bet you won’t wanna
Give yourself to nobody
Baby when the lights go out
It’s like we’re the only ones
And I already feel it now
It’s like you’re the only one
Only one who knows just how
How to make the time stand still
We’re caught in the moment

So don’t let me down
You made those promises
Don’t take em back now
Don’t let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let’s get caught in the moment
Let’s get caught in the moment

Smoking one and rolling one
I come and break you down for fun
You love it when I get up in it
Kiss your body when I’m finished
My drop crotch is by Knomadik
My drop top is automatic
Put you in it, now you tweaking
I kidnap you for the weekend
Rolling up and going up
I’m smoking weed and pouring up
I take that money, hold it up
I take your legs and fold em up
I take my time, I break it down
I tell you not to make a sound
I take that KK, pass it round
Your clothes keep dropping to the ground

So don’t let me down
You made those promises
Don’t take em back now
Don’t let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let’s get caught in the moment
Let’s get caught in the moment
