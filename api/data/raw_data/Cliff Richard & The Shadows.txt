We're all going on a summer holiday
No more working for a week or two
Fun and laughter on our summer holiday
No more worries for me or you
For a week or two
We're going where the sun shines brightly
We're going where the sea is blue
We've seen it in the movies
Now let's see if it's true
Everybody has a summer holiday
Doing things they always wanted to
So we're going on a summer holiday
To make our dreams come true
For me and you
We're going where the sun shines brightly
We're going where the sea is blue
We've seen it in the movies
Now let's see if it's true
Everybody has a summer holiday
Doing things they always wanted to
So we're going on a summer holiday
To make our dreams come true
For me and you
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmmEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The young ones
Darling we're the young ones
And young ones shouldn't be afraid
To live, love
While the flame is strong
'Cause we may not be the young ones very long
Tomorrow
Why wait until tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow sometimes never comes
So love, me
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing while we're young
Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this
I need you and you need me
Oh my darling can't you see
Young dreams
Should be dreamed together
Young hearts shouldn't be afraid
And some day when the years have flown
Darling, then we'll teach the young ones
Of our own(x2)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Bye, bye, baby doll, I find you too high class
I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass
This pink champagne and caviar are all very grand
But I prefer just rocking to a rock 'n' roll band
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby
High Class Baby
Well, go and find a rich man, put your arms around him
Tell him that you love him and go out and drown him
May be wich you're riches, you'll find true happiness
But I'll stay here a-rocking, 'cause it's what I love the best
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby
High Class Baby
Bye, bye, bye, bye, baby doll, I find you too high class
I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass

There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
You've got sable mink and a Cadillac
Believe me honey, you're taking things too far
You can't find a true love with a sack of gold
Come on and love me, little honey, before you grow too old
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoes
Honey, I soon lose the blues, wait until you hear the news
You're still my own true, my very own true
You're still my high class baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
(High class baby, high class baby) Don't be mean to me, baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
(High class baby, high class baby) Don't be mean, babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When the girl in your arms
Is the girl in you heart
Then you have got everything
When you are holding the dream
You have been dreaming you would hold
You're as rich as a king
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
Make her yours for evermoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walkin', talkin', livin' doll
Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk, so no big hunk
Can steal her away from me
Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walkin', talkin', livin' doll
(instrumental)
Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk, so no big hunk
Can steal her away from me
Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walkin', talkin', livin' dollEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh darling, will our love be like an evergreen tree
Stay ever green and young as the seasons go
Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree
Bloom in the summer's sun and the winter's snow
On every branch will blossom
Dreams for me and you
Our tree of love will stay ever green
If our hearts stay ever true
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
On every branch will blossom
Dreams for me and you
Our tree of love will stay ever green
If our hearts stay ever true
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
On the evergreen tree
On the evergreen treeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, I never felt more like singing the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love, baby, you got me singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause everythin's wrong, and nothin' ain't right
Without you, you got me singing the blues
Well, the moon and stars no longer shine
And the dream is gone that I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But cry over you
Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
Didn't want to go, but I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singing the blues
Ooh, the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone that I thought was mine
Well, there's nothin' left for me to do
But cry over you
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause everythin's wrong, and nothin' ain't right
Without you, you got me singing the blues
You got me singing the blues
You got me singing the blues
You got me singing the bluesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If some guy tells you I don't care
And tells you lies while I'm not there
Don't talk to him
And if he tells you I'm untrue
Then darling here's what you must do
Don't talk to him
And if he tells you I've been seen
Walking round with Sue and Jean
He's lying again
Do anything that you want to
But darling this I beg of you
Don't talk to him
If you hear the words he has to say
He'll break your heart
Let your love for me prove strong while we are far apart
So just remember what I say
And trust in me while I'm away
For I'll be true
And just remember my true love
Is brighter than the moon above for only you
And if this guy should try to say
My love for your is only play, merely a whim
Just close your eyes and count to ten
Think of me again
But don't you talk to him
