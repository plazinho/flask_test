Am I throwin' you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know

Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey, don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' ya name
But you're drivin' me crazy the way you're makin' me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more

Frk-frk-down
Hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey

In the day, in the night
Say it right, say it all
You either got it, or you don't
You either stand, or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

But you got what it takes to set me free (Hey, oh, oh, hey)
Oh, you could mean everything to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body (From my body), I could show you (I could show you)
A place (A place) God knows (That only God knows)
You should know the space is holy (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Do you really wanna go?
(Three, four)

Hey, hey, hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey
 
You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely, but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears (Oh)
Even after all these years, years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try
To tell me, me that you love me (Oh-oh)
Each and every single day
I know I'm gonna have to eventually
Give you away

And though my love is rare, rare, rare
And though my love is true, yeah
Hey, I'm just scared
That we may fall through
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm like a bird (I'm like a bird)
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)

Honestly, what will become of me?
Don't like reality, it's way too clear to me
But really, life is dandy
We are what we don't see, we miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Come to an end, come to an...
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an...
Why do all good things come to an end?

Traveling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay (Stay)
Young and restless
Living this way, I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in, and I don't cry
I only feel gravity, and I wonder why

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Well, the dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon, so that they could—
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon, so that they could—

Die, die, die, die

Flames to dust, lovers to friends (Dust, friends)

Well, the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should
Stay away for a day
'Til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping
And the rain forgot how to bring salvation
The dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon, so that they could die
 
It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say "woe is me" instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me, "You're better off alone"

But after midnight, morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know, she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know, she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (By the moon)
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go

But after midnight, morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some

They say that girl ya know, she act too tough tough tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know, she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you come and be with me?
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find?
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me?

All in me yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
Do you see all my dreams? (Yeah)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
Follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Follow me down, follow me
Down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Do you see all my dreams?)
See all my dreams
Follow me follow me follow me
Down down down down
See all my dreams
See all my dreams

All in me yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Where can you turn?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?

I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

They got my rump, rump shakin', I'm another bad creation
All real and I never have to fake it, fake it
You know I gotta move quick and I gotta move slow
'Cause there ain't no end in the road

I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow

All I know
Is everything is not as it's sold
But the more I grow, the less I know
And I have lived so many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
The fewer the seeds, the more I sow

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people are really not real at all
The more I learn, the more I learn
The more I cry, the more I cry
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try

All of the moments that already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be
And that's wonderful, and that's life
And that's you, baby
This is me, baby
And we are, we are, we are, we are
Free
In our love
We are free in our love
 
Someone needs to rap off, in, off the top
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah

You're standing at the door
I'm falling to the floor
You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while, but I couldn't forget you

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't wanna do

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (It's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (Just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath (I can feel your breath)
I wanna touch your hand, but I lay back
'Cause you know this thing could spiral in the night
I've changed my mind, I'm ready for you this time

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little touch has got me seeing things
Just a little taste has got me off the chains
Doing things that I don't wanna do

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (It's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (Just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (It's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (Just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, but I lay back
We're sitting real close, I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand, I cannot fight it off
(D-d-d-d-do it)

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (It's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (Just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
Do it like you do it to me (It's not enough)

Don't you know how much I want you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Yeah, yeah
 
Paint my face in your magazines
Make it look whiter than it seems
Paint me over with your dreams
Shove away my ethnicity
Burn every notion that I
May have a flame inside to fight
And say just what is on my mind
Without offending your might

’Cause this life is too short to live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her face outside today
Weatherworn, lookin' all the rage
Took her passion and her gaze and made a poster
Now it’s moccasins we sport
We take the culture and contort
Perhaps only to distort what we are hidin’

’Cause this life is too short to live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
But say what you want
Say what you want (Say, say)

Hey you, the one, the one outside, are you gonna get in, get in?
Hey you, the one that don’t fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in?
Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your
Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo?

Yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?

’Cause this life is too short to live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
’Cause this life is too short to live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?

Say what you want (Life is too short)
Say what you want
Say what you want (Just for you)
Say what you want
Say what you want (feel powerless)
Say what you want
Say, say, say, say, yeah (Gonna do)

Life is too short
Just for you
Feel powerless
Gonna do
 
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live with you through everything
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live in a kaleidoscope
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
Wanna be the one to spin the wheel

I know that we can only give
When we have hope
But I wanna live
Without any ghosts
Can't protect me from nothing
Can't save me from the truth
You can't even save me from
You

So don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna feel the good and bad in everything
Even when it hurts, even when it hurts

I know that we can only give
When we got a little hope
But I don't like the burden
Of living with these ghosts
Yes, I will hold my head high
When I walk in your parade
But I will always check my gait
I will always watch my gait

Pipe dreams
Pipe dreams
Pipe dreams
Pipe dreams
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
Walk on, walk on
 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a very popular song

You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
Well, I hate to say, but pop ain't going solo
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no
You liked me 'til you seen me on your TV
Well, if you're so low below, then why you watching?
You say good things come to those who wait
I've been waiting a long time for it

Remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you?
Be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?
Now that I've flown away, I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well, I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath, I think it's a lot of yearning
Your face, the colours change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what I'm about

And remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you?
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?
Now that I've flown away, I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

It's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight (Open fire)
Turn in the spitfire (Open fire)
Scream without making a sound (Open fire)
Be up here and without looking down (Open fire)
Because we're all afraid of heights (Bang, bang)

And remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you?
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?
Now that I've flown away, I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And now you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself
