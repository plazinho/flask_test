Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my soul
Staring me up until I can't get enough
When you move it makes my sweat turn cold

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam

Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my mind
Three seconds time, I'm 'bout to redline, singing
Ooh, yeah you shake it so fine

'Cause when you move it slow, my bones start shaking
You move it slow, I can't stop

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
I've got you in the palm of my hand
That's my jam
'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam
But you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

You know I love the way the girl, them shake it up
Cyaan with men, only gyal, then make it up
I love strong, I make way long, long, long up
Drop the rythm and the gyal, then give it up
Confidence from dusk till dawn
Lock the door and turn the lights on
Exodus from the beat of me bone
Now I'm crawling out by morning
Pour your sugar all over me
Wine that body, take you home with me
Feels so good you've got to raise your hands
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance

Every time that I get around ya
Something takes a hold of my soul
Staring me up until I can't get enough
When you move it makes my sweat turn cold

'Cause you're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
And now I've got you in the palm of my hand
Get all dramatic, erratic, your moves are automatic
You're a freak for the rhythm, slave to the dance
That's my jam

That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
That's my jam
 
Too much of us caught in a rat trap we ah fe bust out ah that
Too much of us caught in a rat race ah fe bust out ah that

They're in a contest and a competition
Caught in the snare material suction
If what you've got is all you mention
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you
Pushing and pulling juggling it no stop
There's always free cheese inside a rat trap
You better watch before the snap goes pop
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you

Don't even bother with the boasting
Just take care, cause this ya rat race ain't fair
Even the saints them are falling
So beware! You'll find no winners in there
You know its gonna get you whoa
And it will never let you go(x2)
Rat trap we can't escape from it whoa!
And it will never let you go whoa whoa(x4)
Can't get out of there

Chatty people they will talk all day
Talk your business and they feel no way
Elaborate and make up the story
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you
You're always watching what they got next door
If your belly is full and you still want more
Helping the rich when you go down with the poor
Move on go way I tell you, move on go way I tell you

It's a rat race; it's a rat race
Someone, come on, tell me what is wrong with the human race
Fury breaks the chain! Let us go. (x4)
 
Big tings running through my mind
I think about them all the time
I'm gonna do my ting the way I wanna do it
And everything will be alright
Big tings burning up my soul
I think I'm bout to lose control
Do I tell myself that I can get through it?
Maybe I'll never know

Big tings all in my brain
Big tings got me again

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself

Big tings gonna have their way
I think about them every day
Do I step inside and enjoy the ride?
To hell with what people say

Will I ever be satisfied?
Big tings still on my mind

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself

I can see them coming over the horizon
I don't think that I can trust myself
I can see them coming over the horizon
I don't think that I can trust myself

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than you
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than you
I can't trust myself

Caught in chains, shackles on too tight
Squirmin' for your life because you've gone and lost your freedom
Manacles, cut deep when they're too tight
You have to break the lock or find the key so you defeat dem
Enslaved by the wickedest power
We're smashin' up the cells and all the right ones gonna follow
Uprisin', we need not the chains
And we aren't gonna make the same mistakes again
If you want it, you got to rise and take it
You gotta wake up, you know you can't contain this
Stand for something or you'll fall for anything
If you want it, you got to fight for it
Wake up, you'll never contain it
Stand for something or you'll fall for anything
Wolves they creep, out to take the sheep
The vulnerable, the easy led, the weak, who will protect dem?
Against the wall, now they execute
The blind can't lead the blind
They always need someone to lead dem
Restrained by the evillest power
Captive of the chains because these things you've done are so-ah
Not surprising, it's all done in vain
But you have gone and made the same mistake again
If you want it, you got to rise and take it
You gotta wake up, you know you can't contain this
Stand for something or you'll fall for anything
If you want it, you got to fight for it
Wake up, you'll never contain it
Stand for something or you'll fall for anything
Caught in chains, shackles on too tight
Squirmin' for your life because you've gone and lost your freedom
Manacles, cut deep when they're too tight
You have to break the lock or find the key so you defeat dem
Enslaved by the wickedest power(x4)
Everyday you live, you gotta fight
You got to stand your ground
If you want it, you got to rise and take it
You gotta wake up, you know you can't contain this
Stand for something or you'll fall for anything(x3)
If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything

As poor as you may be
The only one you're hurting is your family
Robbing yourself, it makes no sense
You steal a million but then end up with pence..
'Cause the devil dances in empty pockets
And you're never gonna win by firing rockets
Hear me when I say
So much chaos in these streets, you see that
From the heat there's no retreat, you know that
To the less you only beat, you hear that?
You can't handle no defeat..
But the devil dances in empty pockets
And you're never gonna win by firing rockets
Hear me when I say
Oh, we don't need that no
Oh, we don't need that
Because you're playing with the devil
Causing lightning and thunder
Playing with the devil
Causing lightning and thunder
Oh, here's what we gotta do is move this firewood
Tell him that we're coming through(x3)
Oh, here's what we gotta do is move this firewood
Rise and take over
I smell that plastic burning
Sobered from burning plastic
I smell that plastic burning
Sobered from burning plastic
Playing with the devil, ya gonna get burned!
Because you're playing with the devil
Causing lightning and thunder
Playing with the devil
Causing lightning and thunder
Oh, here's what we gotta do is move this firewood
Tell him that we're coming through(x3)
Oh, here's what we gotta do is move this firewood
Rise and take over

Nuff of the youths in the ghetto firing shots now everyday
Fighting against the ways of Jah, Jah know dem feel no way
If you carry on so then there is a price to pay
Life inside a cell is not a place you wanna stay
Nuff youth them come from good families, families
Too much of them them just ah end up in a cemetery, they're history
Influenced by the badness that them see, What them ah see
Coz there's a lesson to be learn and you just don't have to be, a memory
What you're dealing with you know that that ain't right
The way you carry on the way you love to fight
If you are a rude boy for life, always running into worries and strife
Rude boy for life always walking on the edge of a knife
Top shotter outer road dem, just ah going like them ah don
War for territory, war for own all the land
Gangstarfari Babylon dem pon the pay roll
You can have it all, but end up losing your soul
Infamous roughneck of society
Yes I'm talking to you
Don't wanner hear a word I say
Are you listening to me?
Coz I'm talking to you
If you are a rude boy for life, always running into worries and strife
Rude boy for life always walking on the edge of a knife
Because you're running out of school and you're breaking the rule
You dress up in a suit and you think say you cool
You's a rude boy running round and you're not a clown
Any boy stepping up you ah go push them down
Rude boy for life you want the trouble and strife
Re check your steps turn from death unto life
Another message to you rudie
Burra man ah me say message to you rudie
 
They never realize that they come til we late
Now time done and the worlds on fire
