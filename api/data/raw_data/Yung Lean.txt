Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow

I got an empire of emotion
Squad see me cruisin', cruisin' in my go kart
I'm War ho, I'm Warhol
I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart
Topping the charts, Ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino and I see my own white shadows
A tad too close, rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose, too weird for them other fuckboys
Catch Lean and Sadboys out in Europe, sippin' Cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bro
Don't close your eyes and lean back though
Y'all ain't ready for the Lean attack though
Lean, lean, lean, youngin' with my team
Pumpin' RZA, eating pizza

When I send it, I spit fire, I'm an element
I’m everything, you're irrelevant, ta-take it easy, yeah, we getting it
BBC pants, yeah, I'm getting rich, all this love, I'm melting it
Don't let me down, I'm not meant for it
If you ask me, I might come for it
I'll take you back to the rainforest
My heart and soul, yeah you tore it
I don't want to be here, my life's more of it, there's more of it
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the club with it tatted on my chest
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the cut with it tatted on my chest
See, see me on the bus, blowing sesh
Nothing less, we the best, fuck the rest
Water in my lungs, finna quest, I won't hit the earth
Fire, water, dirt, too turnt, too burnt
Make mistakes, I guess I'll never learn, see, see, see that's my firm
Nike, Nike on my shirt, bubbles, bubbles, blowing bubbles
But I guess they'll never burst, em-empire of my state of mind
I'ma do me, I'ma make her mine

Emotional boys, 2001
Emotional shawties in this bitch
Makaveli

Bitches come and go, brah
But you know I stay
Bitches come and go, brah
But you know I stay

Got my balls licked
By a Zooey Deschanel look-alike cocaine addict
Razor blade to your head
Conflict, I'm a contradicted shit
Peeing on old people's houses is an inflict
2003 shit
This ain't no splitting bills shit
I'ma peel banana skids
While listenin' to R. Kelly's greatest hits

Yung Lean in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)
Yung Lean up in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)
Poppin' pills like zits
While someone vomits on your mosquito tits
Slitting wrists while dark evil spirits like Slytherin
Slither in with tricks, I'm sick
Acid trip makes my spitting sick
And makes me start hitting chicks
Knitting thick, shitting quick, fitting dick
Like transmitting shit with an AIDS stick
Think you're gay as fuck like a fish stick
Tequila shots and salt licks
Getting balls in your face like a free kick
Yung Lean stays motherfuckin' freaky (Bitch)

Yung Lean in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)
Yung Lean up in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)

Rotten teeth like Gargamel
Cast a spell, you keep on tryin' to yell
Bet your dead body stinks worse than my S'well
Well, Lean expels
Diagrams as if they were made in Excel
Fuck fat hoes like Adele
Get my dick stuck inside a lamp shell
Get it out with sperm cells and hair gel
Swim in Mexico, mademoiselle
Point and laugh while he fell
Who's laughing now, now that I'm explosive like Alfred Nobel
Yung Lean only attracts an older clientele
Very well (Bitch)125EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Am I awake? I gotta check
Went to sleep, never came back
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack
Iced out, right back
PCP attack, 3D pills
Hoes on my ball sack
They don't know how to act
High tech watch, high tech locked
Broken skies, fantastic fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock
Emotionalboys we in the UFO
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playing Mario
Sadboys blastin' your stereos
Sucking on my nuts like pistachios
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio
Slangin' dough, hoe I'm in that polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio
Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let 'em in

My life's on the line

Clearly on drugs
That will make you hear, clearly wrong
Longer than my yearly bong hit
Shawty thinks she got style
Leandoer dresses slicker
I'm so iced out that it's winter
Destroy my stupid liver
I be on that Bape shit, you rocking Quicksilver
Never hesitate shit, to pull the trigger
Luxurious steak before my dinner
Throw bodies down the river
Yeah, you get that picture
Gold and silver 'round my finger
Shawty on that West Side, she a gold digger
Wake up and I'm a winner
Showering in five star
Hoe take a look in the mirror
I'm on my grind like all the time
Bitch I'm Murakami
Shawty sucking on my pastrami, get that salami

Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely

Be the only hope I got left
Blessed without success
Fuck stress I'm gonna trust the best
I'm nervous that she's so upset
She don't want me, bitch I'm flustered
I'm an aristocrat without the progress
Roses all on her wedding dress
Blood from her mouth, I'm a mess
Alien faces everywhere I go
Downtown bitch that's where I smoke
Got my heart next to my phone
Do or die? Stupid high
Lonely nights, finna sacrifice
Fuck your life, I need mine
I'll take yours and rewind
Walk in my shoes, you'll see why
Fuck everyone, I don’t reply
Sad boys bitch, we world wide
Grey sweatshirt, L size
Wakizashi and grape Nikes
Fuck norms, fuck a normal life
Fuck norms, I'll break em out
A year and I'll blow that’s what I said
Lean, lean, lean you got it in your head
Like a disease you know I spread
I can't sleep without you on my bed
Yoshi city, that's the town
All me, I came up now
Sad boys, time to burn it down
Windows down, face out
Squad up when we riding out
We riding out
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down

You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

I be, I be grinding, making money, it's for me and you
I love the way you dancing and your top is see-through
We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through
Money in my pocket and you know I want you
I've been busy, got so much work, I can't always be with you
Percocets my system, when I go to sleep I know it's you
When I was in the hospital, I saw you
I know what you feel inside 'cause I feel you
I gotta stay true, my money rain blue
Hennessy and Sailor Moon, I just wanna be with you
I know what your feelings are 'cause I know I feel you
My money rain blue, Hennessy and Sailor Moon

I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true

You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you (All I ever see)
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
She shouldn't have to ask, whatever she wants
I stay up till dawn, barbed wire on my arm
They wanna see me fall, they wanna see me fall
I don't care at all, I'm a young rockstar
Livin' in the dark, livin' in the dark
Leandoer the God, we've been goin' hard
Ever since she called, I don't have a heart
I went to the stars
What you want from me? I can get it for you
Get-get-get-get-get it for you
You-you-you don't, you don't want me, do you? (Do you?)
You don't want me, do you? (Do you?)
Know what I'll do to you

Paranoid, sledgehammer, that's my Ruger
Woke up, realized I had to move up (Leandoer)

I'm chasing witches in the street
I'm the last page in your book
Can't write a song, only do hooks
Watching horses in the fields
The dragon rests in agony
When I'm afraid I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time
When I'm afraid I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time

Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin

So many lies that I found
Blood, heaven, I stick to the ground
So many times I realized
What I seek for is right in front of my eyes
I'm alone in a hole in the ground
A theatre of dogs is still around
My furniture has come alive
I'm dancing with a candlestick tonight
Flying kites, raven outside my window
Smiles with fright
Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin
Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin
