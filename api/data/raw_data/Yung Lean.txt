I fuck the shine, I said fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind
Yung Lean swervin' in, see me fucked up
See me swervin' through, they want me locked up
Been locked up in my own mind
My thoughts will never be shallow

I got an empire of emotion
Squad see me cruisin', cruisin' in my go kart
I'm War ho, I'm Warhol
I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart
Topping the charts, Ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino and I see my own white shadows
A tad too close, rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose, too weird for them other fuckboys
Catch Lean and Sadboys out in Europe, sippin' Cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bro
Don't close your eyes and lean back though
Y'all ain't ready for the Lean attack though
Lean, lean, lean, youngin' with my team
Pumpin' RZA, eating pizza
Man I'm living my dreams, living my dreams
(Fucked your bitch in the…)

My life comprehended, it's not a lie, I'm depended on my team
When I send it, I spit fire, I'm an element
I’m everything, you're irrelevant, ta-take it easy, yeah, we getting it
BBC pants, yeah, I'm getting rich, all this love, I'm melting it
Don't let me down, I'm not meant for it
If you ask me, I might come for it
I'll take you back to the rainforest
My heart and soul, yeah you tore it
I don't want to be here, my life's more of it, there's more of it
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the club with it tatted on my chest
S-A-D B-O-Y-S
See me in the cut with it tatted on my chest
See, see me on the bus, blowing sesh
Nothing less, we the best, fuck the rest
Water in my lungs, finna quest, I won't hit the earth
Fire, water, dirt, too turnt, too burnt
Make mistakes, I guess I'll never learn, see, see, see that's my firm
Nike, Nike on my shirt, bubbles, bubbles, blowing bubbles
But I guess they'll never burst, em-empire of my state of mind
I'ma do me, I'ma make her mine
I say fuck the shine, I say fuck the shine
Bitch, I grind, bitch, I grind, I'm hard to find

Makaveli

Bitches come and go, brah
But you know I stay
Bitches come and go, brah
But you know I stay

Got my balls licked
By a Zooey Deschanel look-alike cocaine addict
Razor blade to your head
Conflict, I'm a contradicted shit
Peeing on old people's houses is an inflict
2003 shit
This ain't no splitting bills shit
I'ma peel banana skids
While listenin' to R. Kelly's greatest hits

Yung Lean in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)
Yung Lean up in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)

Poppin' pills like zits
While someone vomits on your mosquito tits
Slitting wrists while dark evil spirits like Slytherin
Slither in with tricks, I'm sick
Acid trip makes my spitting sick
And makes me start hitting chicks
Knitting thick, shitting quick, fitting dick
Like transmitting shit with an AIDS stick
Think you're gay as fuck like a fish stick
Tequila shots and salt licks
Getting balls in your face like a free kick
Yung Lean stays motherfuckin' freaky (Bitch)

Yung Lean in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)
Yung Lean up in the club
For some morphine (Morphine)

Rotten teeth like Gargamel
Cast a spell, you keep on tryin' to yell
Bet your dead body stinks worse than my S'well
Well, Lean expels
Diagrams as if they were made in Excel
Fuck fat hoes like Adele
Get my dick stuck inside a lamp shell
Get it out with sperm cells and hair gel
Swim in Mexico, mademoiselle
Point and laugh while he fell
Who's laughing now, now that I'm explosive like Alfred Nobel
Yung Lean only attracts an older clientele
Very well (Bitch)
 
What's up, what's up
Suicideyear, ooh

Sadboys, we on deck
Am I awake? I gotta check
Went to sleep, never came back
I'm the same guy smoking loud pack
Iced out, right back
PCP attack, 3D pills
Hoes on my ball sack
They don't know how to act
High tech watch, high tech locked
Broken skies, fantastic fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock
Emotionalboys we in the UFO
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playing Mario
Sadboys blastin' your stereos
Sucking on my nuts like pistachios
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio
Slangin' dough, hoe I'm in that polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio
Louis duffle bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let 'em in
Louis duffle bag filled with heroin

Bitch I light up the sky, call me Charmeleon
My life's on the line
I ain't Charmander, but I'm nearly on
Clearly on drugs
That will make you hear, clearly wrong
Longer than my yearly bong hit
Shawty thinks she got style
Leandoer dresses slicker
I'm so iced out that it's winter
Destroy my stupid liver
I be on that Bape shit, you rocking Quicksilver
Never hesitate shit, to pull the trigger
Luxurious steak before my dinner
Throw bodies down the river
Yeah, you get that picture
Gold and silver 'round my finger
Shawty on that West Side, she a gold digger
Wake up and I'm a winner
Showering in five star
Hoe take a look in the mirror
I'm on my grind like all the time
Bitch I'm Murakami
Shawty sucking on my pastrami, get that salami
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt

Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely

Be the only hope I got left
Blessed without success
Fuck stress I'm gonna trust the best
I'm nervous that she's so upset
She don't want me, bitch I'm flustered
I'm an aristocrat without the progress
Roses all on her wedding dress
Blood from her mouth, I'm a mess
Alien faces everywhere I go
Downtown bitch that's where I smoke
Got my heart next to my phone
Do or die? Stupid high
Lonely nights, finna sacrifice
Fuck your life, I need mine
I'll take yours and rewind
Walk in my shoes, you'll see why
Fuck everyone, I don’t reply
Sad boys bitch, we world wide
Grey sweatshirt, L size
Wakizashi and grape Nikes
Fuck norms, fuck a normal life
Fuck norms, I'll break em out
A year and I'll blow that’s what I said
Lean, lean, lean you got it in your head
Like a disease you know I spread
I can't sleep without you on my bed
Yoshi city, that's the town
All me, I came up now
Sad boys, time to burn it down
Windows down, face out
Squad up when we riding out
We riding out

Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely clown
I'm a lonely clown, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely; I'm a lonely, lonely
 
I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

I be, I be grinding, making money, it's for me and you
I love the way you dancing and your top is see-through
We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through
Money in my pocket and you know I want you
I've been busy, got so much work, I can't always be with you
Percocets my system, when I go to sleep I know it's you
When I was in the hospital, I saw you
I know what you feel inside 'cause I feel you
I gotta stay true, my money rain blue
Hennessy and Sailor Moon, I just wanna be with you
I know what your feelings are 'cause I know I feel you
My money rain blue, Hennessy and Sailor Moon

I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you (All I ever see)
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through

She shouldn't have to ask, whatever she wants
I stay up till dawn, barbed wire on my arm
They wanna see me fall, they wanna see me fall
I don't care at all, I'm a young rockstar
Livin' in the dark, livin' in the dark
Leandoer the God, we've been goin' hard
Ever since she called, I don't have a heart
I went to the stars
What you want from me? I can get it for you
Get-get-get-get-get it for you
You-you-you don't, you don't want me, do you? (Do you?)
You don't want me, do you? (Do you?)
Know what I'll do to you

I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you (Fiending for you)
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true (Don't know if it's true)
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you (Fiending for you)
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true (Don't know if it's true)

I lost everything, only thing I'm scared is to lose you
I heard voices in my head, yeah, they whispered to us
Paranoid, sledgehammer, that's my Ruger
Woke up, realized I had to move up (Leandoer)
Worked my soul away everyday, now my loot up
But the truth is, I wish I never knew us
God of violence, pink dreams in my two cup

Take a pill and go to sleep
I'm chasing witches in the street
I'm the last page in your book
Can't write a song, only do hooks
Watching horses in the fields
The dragon rests in agony
When I'm afraid I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time
When I'm afraid I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time

Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin

So many lies that I found
Blood, heaven, I stick to the ground
So many times I realized
What I seek for is right in front of my eyes
I'm alone in a hole in the ground
A theatre of dogs is still around
My furniture has come alive
I'm dancing with a candlestick tonight
Flying kites, raven outside my window
Smiles with fright

Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin
Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin
Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin

Catch me in a Hummer with your mother and Macy Gray
Million ways, posted up in the Milky Way
Silky lake with a couple hundred bills to pay
Stuck in a Monday with Bill all day
Neon lights and I swerve around

Shawty what you sippin' on? Gatorade
Shawty what you smokin' on? Lemonade
I'm up in the sky, finna elevate
Mix it with some Kool-Aid
Pop 'em pills cos I get paid
 
Yung Leandoer
Shawty, you know what it do
2015, MIA, skrrt

'Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
'Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
'Cause I keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan

'Cause I keep that kush from Afghanistan and I smoke that OG
I'm fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold
I'm a cannon, I'ma blow, dirty jeans on my bodyguard
I'll take ya to the cold, yeah, I'll take ya to the cold (Keep that)

'Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
'Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
'Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
'Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me

Gl— Gl— Gl— Gl— Glass interior, yeah, I broke the barrier
I don't want that shawty, yeah, you should go and marry her
I'm on my cellular, we rollin' Jheri curls
Yeah, I'm elegant for the hell of it
Roll that shit, water it like a fish and sell that shit
Twelve a bag, twelve a bitch, Acne jeans, I'm on my shit
Sewer cup, double up, James Bond, hit and run
Hit 'em up, fuck my guts, I'm in it for the fuckin' lunch
Captain Crunch, blowin' bubble gum, pitbull jaw on the hunt
Mind of a maniac, money on my mind
Had to leave that place, couldn't take it at the time
Now I'm on my fuckin' grind, yeah, I'm on my fuckin' grind (Leandoer)

'Cause I keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me
'Cause keep that kush up on me, kush from Afghanistan
Keep that kush up on me, keep that kush up on me

Fucked, I roll, posted up in the cold
Yeah, I'm fucked, I roll kush from Afghanistan
 
Tryna tell me something, I don't listen
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I see green lights, missed misfits smokin' cannabis
THC bliss, I'm a dove, you're a counterfeit
Draped in silk, but I ain't pay shit for this outfit
Saw you in the lobby once
Robin jeans, my wings were up
Don't fuck with me I'm Hulk Hogan, you saw my face but I'm so numb

Hundred stacks, hundred stacks on me
Can't leave, can't be free, hunnid stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
Hundred stacks, hundred stacks on me
Can't leave, can't be free, hunnid stacks
(Stacks on me)

Yeah, I got the knife, I don't wanna use it tonight
Let the stars decide if I'm gonna live or die
Gonna lose my mind, runnin', runnin' through the night
Creepin' up outside, with my team, you know I'm high
Pull up with no lights, blowin' smoke, drinkin' ice
What's your blood type, what does it taste like?
Ridin' on my bike when this rain is comin' down
All my boys can fly, we're like angels in the night

Hundred stacks, hundred stacks on me
Can't leave, can't be free, hunnid stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll up!

Louis, Gucci, Polo, I rock all that shit every day
Catch me in a four-door with Yung Sherman, hop out in LA
Buildings fallin' down, I need money, I need mine today
You can do it how you like, I know I'm stuck up in my ways
I woke up in a Gucci linen bed, I'm feelin' fine today
Make it rain, I make it burn
Take my chances, take my turns

Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Runnin' up the highway on a mission, mission
 
Lean
Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin', homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris

Two dead rats, Hennessy, a gallon
Got a lotta shit in my bag like Santa
Bitches see me, hoes gettin' tantrum
Rockstar bitch, I'm like Marilyn Manson
Dirt on my face, bitches think I'm handsome
18, but my money likes expansion
Me and my boys was just out in Aspen
Actin' reckless, people call us madmen
I've always been this way and I call them has-beens
Never gave a fuck 'cause nothing ever mattered
Accept the actions, forget the sanction
Blowin' smoke in your face, became a dragon
Money in my right and my left hand
Ridin' on a horse with a dead man
Xans in my left hand

Lean
Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin' homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris

Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin' homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris
 
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
I see her

I see her
At the back of the club with my boys blowing dub
We don't talk, don't show love
White shoes, white gloves
Dark night, end of
You got dro? Lots of
In the sky, like a dove
I wanna die and reach above
I never lie, as I seek of
The one who walked out of my life
I can’t get a hold of
SBE is who you speak of
I wanna be the one who you speak of
The one who you dream of
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
I see her

Thinkin' bout what once was
And how I should have done it better
Smokin' drugs
'Till I'm reckless
Now I'm wrecked and you miss me like I reckon
Snow White coke
I'ma die as a legend
Never felt threatened
We used to be peasants
Me and my boys blowin' up like nuclear weapons
Spray painted heaven
My shit together
The whole world infected
Only the fans get it
I see my reflection
Get my money, then I check in
You’re blessed by my presence
I just died and I checked in to heaven
To heaven

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
I see her
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down
Lay me down
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
I see her
I see her
 
Heart, heart, heart of a lion, lion
Heart departed from my soul
Thanks to everyone who hates me, only makes me fit my role
I got orange juice and doobies
I'll be tourin' troops and groupies
Shed fire, vampire, diamonds, diamonds, I got rubies
I got pills in my smoothies
SBE, just some loonies
Move like gang, hit the scene with my trueies
Money, money in my bank account
You know I've gotta spend it all
Flick the lighter's light
If I die you'll never see me fall
Fuck the police, till the, till the, till the curtain call
Ball? No, basketball, New shoes, bank calls
Mix it with some alcohol, Adderalls, till I fall
Not supposed to make it so we chase it till we got 'em all
Made it, did it, out of zero
Flipped it, got it, made a hero
Fuck the game, I've been a year old
Faster than you like De Niro
If you don't like me, get the fuck out my face
I'm ridin' in a starship, get the fuck out my way
 
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour

Optimus Prime
Do her from behind
Police knocking on my door I've done my time
Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind
I'm grinding grinding
Sad boys they be shining shining
Focus on whining whining
When the neon lightning strikes and then I'm on the floor crying, crying

Why do I gotta be alive
I ain't about that life I ain't bout that life
Fuck all of y'all no one can tell me shit
I'm with my team I'm so high please get up off my dick
I love nature and everything around me
But when an eye press into find me
I'm on the floor crying, crying
Sad boys says that I'm dying, dying

Optimus Prime
Do her from behind
Police knocking on my door I've done my time
Wake me up at 7 just to fuck with my grind
I'm grinding grinding
Sad boys they be shining shining
Focus on whining whining
When the neon lightning strikes and then I'm on the floor crying, crying

Rocks got me chipping
Pussy starts a-dripping
I might just have to slip in
Grey Goose sipping
Pink skies got me tripping
Never catch me slippin', never catch me slippin'
High-tec polo gear sipping
Up that Jack when I'm in Narashino flipping
Sushi bars after bars catch me whipping
Up that ho while she dripping
Glock in my Gucci belt got you equipping
Anime shawtys be stripping
I get paid by the bars but you never catch me slipping
No you never get me slipping

Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour
Bitches on my dick cause I'm so luxurious
Light Saber in one hand, I can be your saviour

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears... Time to die

B— B— Bitch it's lil' Lean, emperor of the city
Silver rings on, sitting on fifty
Blowing on winter, icy like a stunner
Looking like winter, temperature like the summer
Chain like a seahorse, is that really Leandoer?
All white Dior, all I wear is neon
Catch me on my Samsung, SBE anthem
I be in the night creepin' 'round like the phantom

Airbrushed Aerox like I'm nineteen
Light speed, color lime green, look like ice cream
Light beam, Cola Light stream on your white jeans
Five ki's and my eyes bleed on the Nikes
Headlock, scope, red dot, it's a headshot
Shell shock, do the airdrop, I got dead stock
Flood light, purple drug, Sprite, that's my blood type
I wish none of this was real life, burning sunlight

You don't know what I'm up to
You don't talk about it 'less you do
Got a flight crew, we Sky Team
Seen you 'round town, got bad dreams
It's that weed and purple we up to
Just got a bunch of 'em Nike shoes
I make money, my whole crew do
It's Sadboys, we'll fuck you
