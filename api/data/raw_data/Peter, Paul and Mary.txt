Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Little Jackie Paper
Loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax
And other fancy stuff

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Together they would travel
On a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a look-out
Perched on Puff's gigantic tail

Noble kings and princes
Would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags
When Puff roared out his name

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

A dragon lives forever
But not so, little boys
Painted wings and giants' rings
Make way for other toys

One grey night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon
He ceased his fearless roar

His head was bent in sorrow
Green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
Along the cherry lane

Without his lifelong friend
Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon
Sadly slipped into his cave

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
 
If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way
This a-way, this a-way, this a-way, this a-way
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way

If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
 
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I think of you
Every song I sing I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring (I'll wear your ring)

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the time I won't have to say (I won't have to say)

Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
 
When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me
"Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree"
"Don't put your faith in love, my boy" my father said to me
"I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree"

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day she left without a word, she took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind I knew what she had done
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

Lemon tree (Lemon tree)
Lemon tree (Lemon tree)
Lemon tree (Lemon tree)
Lemon tree
 
If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger

I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land, ooh

Well I got a hammer
And I got a bell
And I got a song to sing (Song to sing)
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for Him who made us all

And all the little children that round your table grow
The cattle in your stable, the dog by your front door
And all that dwells within your gates, we wish you ten times more

I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand
I'll love you more than anybody can
And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time

The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime

I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes
And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
Whisper all the joy that is mine

The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime

I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand
I'll love you more than anybody can
Mmm
Mmm

The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
