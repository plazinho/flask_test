I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way59EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

(Help me)
I broke apart my insides
(Help me)
I've got no soul to sell
(Help me)
The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything
(Help me)
You tear down my reason
(Help me)
It's your sex I can smell
(Help me)
You make me perfect
Help me become somebody else

I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scraped off my knees
I drink the honey
Inside your hive
You are the reason
I stay alive51EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within

Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure

Give it

Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness
I now know the depths I reach are limitless
Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
Oh, my beautiful liar
Oh, my precious whore
My disease, my infection
I am so impure16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He couldn't believe how easy it was
He put the gun into his face
Bang!
(So much blood from such a tiny little hole)
Problems do have solutions, you know
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash
Everything's blue
Everything's blue in this world
The deepest shade of mushroom blue
All fuzzy
Spilling out of my head14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Step right up, march, push
Crawl right up on your knees
Please, greed, feed
(No time to hesitate)
I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
Don't like the look of it
Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?

Shove it up, inside, surprise!
Lies, stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?
The pigs have won tonight
Now they can all sleep soundly
And everything is all right14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hey pig
Yeah you
Hey pig piggy pig pig pig
All of my fears came true
Black and blue and broken bones
You left me here, I'm all alone
My little piggy needed something new

Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I just don't care

Hey pig
Nothing's turning out the way I planned
Hey pig
There's a lot of things I hoped you could help me understand
What am I supposed to do?
I lost my shit because of you

Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I don't care anymore
Nothing can stop me now, 'cause I just don't care

You had all of them on your side
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies
Didn't you? Didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left
In my fucking world is wearing your disease

How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd it get so hard?
How'd it get so long?

You had to give them all a sign
Didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine
Didn't you?  Didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd it get so long?
And what you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are

You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now

Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me

This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell
Twenty-six years, on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me, I hate everyone

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back
I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to, but I can't turn back

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you
Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

This world full of you
This world full of you

I beat my machine
It's a part of me, it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream
It's changing me, I am becoming
The me that you know
He had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs
He is broken and sore
The me that you know
He doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore

All pain disappears
It's the nature of of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear
No escape from this, my new consciousness
The me that you know
He used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping
And he is left to decay
The me that you know
Is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you
I'm so far away
I can try to get away
But I’ve strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away
The sound in my ears
I can see it killing away
All of my bad parts
I don't want to listen
But it's all too clear
Hiding backwards inside of me
I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter
I might just slip away

It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head
It won't give up, it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Focus?
We didn't even notice
We awake in a place
We can barely recognize
Yeah, hypnosis

And you can justify it all
Your back was up against the wall again

Shut up, silence
Add a little violence
And offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

So, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Go and look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Needful
Too many fucking people
You'll have to take care of yourselves
You know I've got my hands full

And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

Oh, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Hey, look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?


So, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than? (Are you less- Are you less than?)
And look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?
Yes this is about you

True believers
Did it feel that hole
Doesn't it make you feel better3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
