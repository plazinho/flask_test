Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Hey, hey, hey, hey53EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out

Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)

To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't stop me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't choke me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

I'm feeling the pressure
I can't break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face, out of my mind
I see your corruption
I'm not blind
I'll carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done I will make you pay

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve, mmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

And now I need to know - is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? mmm
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you need
But now I have finally seen the end
(finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no
(expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light
(finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized
(realized)
I need to love
I need to love

Come to me, just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know I can be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonflies out in the Sun
You know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies are all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace
When the day is done
And this old World is a new World and a bold World
For me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine and you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
Butterflies, ooh
Oh, ooh ...
Ooooh...freer than you...ooooh...

Far away
This ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die
Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms

My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away

Black holes and revelations

Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night

Love, it will get you nowhere
You're on your own
Lost in the wild
So come to me now
I could use someone like you
Someone who'll kill on my command
And asks no questions

Are you a human drone? (Aye, sir)
Are you a killing machine? (Aye, sir)
I'm in control, motherfucker, do you understand? (Aye, sir)

Your mind is just a program
And I'm the virus
I'm changing the station
I'll improve your thresholds
I'll turn you into a super drone (A super drone)
And you will kill on my command
And I won't be responsible

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game, I tried to infiltrate but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
Wooaahhh24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Come ride with me through the veins of history
I'll show you a god falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time, or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive


No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

It's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah, I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out

'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now, I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out, escaping now
Feeling my faith erode21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dead inside
(Dead inside)
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me, babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died, long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside


You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside
(Dead inside)

Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting, babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything, I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside
(Dead inside)36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
