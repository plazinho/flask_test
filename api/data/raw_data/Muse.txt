Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out

And when I am done I will make you pay

And now I need to know - is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? mmm
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

And I have finally realized what you need
But now I have finally seen the end

Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game, I tried to infiltrate but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living

Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

My plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, whoa
My plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living
And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble

Come ride with me through the veins of history
I'll show you a god falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time, or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive


No one's gonna take me alive

It's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah, I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out

'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

'Cause I want it now, I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now, I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out, escaping now
Feeling my faith erode21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dead inside
(Dead inside)
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me, babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like it died, long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside


You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside, you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside
(Dead inside)

Feel me now, hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me, stop hiding from me
It's hurting, babe
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything, I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside

I have lived in darkness
For all my life, I've been pursued
You'd be afraid if you could feel my pain
And if you could see the things I am able to see

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

I hail from the dark side
For all my life, I've been besieged
You'd be scared living with my despair
And if you could feel the things I am able to feel

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free

Break me out, break me out
Let me flee
Break me out, break me out
Set me free
Save me from the dark side
Break me out, break me out

Is our secret safe tonight?
And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?

It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm

Bound and restricted
I tried to give you up
But I'm addicted

Sense of elation
You'd never dream of
Breaking this fixation
You will squeeze the life out of me

Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth?

You're swelling up, you're unstoppable
'Cause you've seen, seen
