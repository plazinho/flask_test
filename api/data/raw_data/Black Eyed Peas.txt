What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)80EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Layin' on the ground died from a choke

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The energy never dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite
Welcome

From all intellect, collect the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition

Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Honey got her sexy on steamin'

Perfection, mami, you gleamin'
Inception, you got a brother dreamin', dreamin'
Damn, baby, I'm feenin'
I'm tryna holla at you, I'm screamin'
Let me love you down this evenin'
Lovie lovie, yeah, you know you are my demon
Girl, we can form a team, and
I could be the King, you could be the Queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin'
I love you long time, so you know the meanin'

Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signs her name on my heart with an "XO"
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime, I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm
Something 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto​

Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

This is mega switch-up
Switch-up, switch-up
I just can't switch-up

Locked, sunk in your bedrock
Heart, pumpin' your love-shot
Knocked out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your headlock (Switch up)
Can't stop, won't quit
Makin' me fiend, give it to me
I want it all, you know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (Switch up)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (Switch up)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory

I just can't switch-up25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Oh no)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
"I love you, boo", "I love you too"
"I miss you a lot", "I miss you even more"
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy (Why, why, why)

Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering, kill it with the sound and
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control

Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
I never been a quitta
But I do deserve betta
Believe me, I will do bad
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing, same ass excuses
Boy, you're useless, woah, oh!

A day in a life of a kid in America
Everyone's a critic, watch them criticize your character
Everybody watching ya
People love to stare at ya
Everybody's greedy ain't nobody tryna share with ya
Our leaders are embarrassing
I think they need some parenting
Tell me why they playing with the fire and the kerosene?
Kids on the Percocet, trippin' on the medicine
Call it like I see ya we some drugged up Americans
Everybody's following
Ain't nobody leading
People lovin' guns more than kids is the season
And they say the reason is to protect their freedom
But we don't believe 'em

'Cause all that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
And all that we have
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love
When I was a young boy
Used to hear the people say
Power to the people but we them people nowadays
We ain't never giving up
Now we got our hands up
We can't breathe, cause their hearts ain't big enough
All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing
War is the answer but really, what's the question?
Money got 'em stressin'
Fear got 'em flexin'
Phones got us zoned out
Now we lose connection, please stand by
It takes you and I to keep the hope alive
'Cause we're living in a time where you're fighting to survive
And all we need is love

All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love
Life is a blessing
Knowledge is a weapon
You should choose love instead of being reckless
Candle in the darkness, hope changes the heartless
Here's love to guide you, I'll be there regardless
Situation global, we're like in a rowboat
Swimming up the river, so I can deliver
Messages to masses, no matter your status
Nothing's ever over, we believe in second chances
Many people dying, governments are lying
Stand for our rights and please no more violence
Talk with the kindness, together we're united
When we are one
Nothing can divide us

All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Pt.1
Wake up!

I wanna say what's on my motherfuckin' conscious
The whole world right now is fucking bonkers
The internet is the brand new conqueror
So watch out for the motherfuckin' monsters, yikes
The trolls are the taunters
Whoever controls the data got the answers
They the ones that got the code to the launcher
And they be having dinner with the Pope and the mobsters
They know the cure for the cancer
Cure for the AIDS and they prolly killed the Panthers
Put us in a cage, got us living like hamsters
Put us in the dark but I got me a lantern
Open up my third eye, then I illuminate
Willy got a bird eye view when I elevate
No Illuminati, baby, I'm god body
The rapture like Blondie, wakin' up zombies
(Wake up!)

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
(Wake up!)

A wise man said knowledge is king
Know thyself and you can do anything
Know thyself and you can shine like bling
Know thyself and you the king of the ring, ha
But they don't teach kids nothing
All they know is iPad, sugar in their muffin
They don't know division, don't add to nothing
Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing
He in the streets cause he always cuttin'
The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'
All they do was stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em with stuff he can't use
So he sell crack, that's what he know to do
His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too
And that's why you see the lil' killer in the news
It's kinda like they got us in a trap
It's kinda like they knowin' how we act
I'll be like "fuck your fuckin' laboratory, I am not a rat"
I am light, I am God body, wise to the fact
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
(Wake up!)

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Pt.2
Shh
Wake up!
Wake up!
Eyes open, who's watching the watchers?
Clock ticking like we're running out of options
Villains in the White House, heroes in their coffins
Leaders double cross while we kneeling to our crosses
Whose policing the police, why they stalking?
All lives matter 'til your color is the target
Fox rounding up the sheep for the slaughter
Money over people while they reaching for that dollar
All I see's lies on the screen
Land of the free, but what the fuck's free?
What does it cost to let a nigga breathe?
King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh
They robbed you blind and knowledge is a crime
This shit's designed to keep you on a grind
Rise and shine 'cause now it's the time
We all God body if you open up your mind
(Wake up!)

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Pt.3
Ain't nothing impossible, I tell myself
That I am possible, I know that devil
Is out there and plotting those plans
To stop me and put me in a hospital bed
I said "Yo, I will not be toppled
I'm down with Jesus and I roll with apostles"
We got that big love, that love that's colossal
We meditate, ain't no need to get hostile
You cannot penetrate me with the hate
We got that good vibration on vibrate
Stay on that way up 'cause we elevate
We got that big love, that love heavyweight

Wait, wait, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Ha, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel

I tell them, yo
The movement's unstoppable
Pausing the flow, that is not optional
I let 'em know, everything's solvable
When you know science, everything is plausible
I am defiant, I'm also logical
Politicians be tripping, they comical
So I sit back and listen to audio
Spiritual hip-hop, I call that hypnoticals
We Budda-Boy, B-Boy phenomenals
We Zulu-kill zombies in chronicles
We ain't falling 'cause we ain't dominoes
That revolution is on go, go

Go, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Yup, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
