Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind
T-T-This is real salvation in the flesh
I-I-I do not care what they're thinking anyway (Fuck)

H-H-Hide your shame, so two-faced with the shit you say
Stay away, everything you do makes me so enraged
Wide awake, I can't fucking sleep or give my mind a break
Fuck, how can I support myself in such a state?
Why would I wait and assume this shit?
I put my heart and the truth in it
Niggas so blind that they shoot and miss
All of these scars, they consumed my wrist, yah
North Face on my coat, yuh
Better go change your tone, yah
What drugs help you cope? ayy
They don't need to know, yuh (Die)
Slipping isn't something that I like

Pedal to the metal when I drive
Wrestling with The Devil all the time, oh yah, oh yah
Jumping up a level at a time (Ayy)
Scar sound-waves can't die, oh yah, oh yah (Die)

Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind
T-T-This is real salvation in the flesh
I-I-I do not care what they're thinking anyway

These acts of mine, these facts I stay with
These hands of God, these hands I came with
I let them go, these days I regret
These doubtful flaws, I've got no patience

Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life (Ayy, ayy)
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind
 
What you're looking at, is the aftermath of the grand jury deciding not to indict, Officer Wilson
Eurgh

Pretending everything is fine won't help
You say you're happy with the shit that sells
This fucking life really sounds like Hell
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself, eugh
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself
Don't act like you're no sinner
This time, I shall not forget
This time, I rise from the dead
This time, I am not afraid
I don't see the meaning in these fucking games

(And why?)

Change facts, live fast, it helps us forget pain
Reach back, no thanks, I still go against grains
Point fingers away, don't blame 'til they break
Hype up and see your life's covered in flames
I'm so done with the waiting
Will I find my relief from this mind?
My whole body is craving
A better way of living my life

Eh yah yah, Scar, a-Lxrd, yeah
Laughing

I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself

There ain't shit that I'm proud of
I'm so sick of this household, we call Earth
I would love it, but it's fucking filled with assholes
B-B-Beat us down with passion, aye
We will go out laughing, aye

Helps me to chill and unload, aye
Nothin' but gas in the roach, aye
Grey clouds help me cope, aye
Doing fine for so long, yeah

Spent too much time on my own, hey (Aye, aye)
Might wrap that rope 'round my throat, hey
I like to save, I don’t spend
I got some shit I regret

Invite me, I still won't attend (Fuck)
Find yourself, that's the mission

My mental is all aching, it's all good (Yeah)
They wanna know how I'm coping

Nothing's really tragic when they sitting at the door
Anything can happen when your mind is not a flaw
Reconsider patterns that be flowing out your jaw
Go and live life to the fullest like fuck it then
Angels and demons don't love you no more
Clipped both your wings, now you're stuck on the floor

Fuck nigga, you don't want war
Spit bars around your head 'til it's gone
My mouth's got them clips in the jaw

I don't give a fuck about contracts
Wear a lawsuit if you're on that
Used to be broke as fuck doin' videos
Now I tour the world with 30 grand in my backpack
We had to split the money three ways
Otherwise, we ain't even getting through customs
Walk from a friend if they seem fake
It looks like life's too short to be runnin', I think
I really should be happy with the places I've been
I blame my expectations for this lavish life I live
King Scarlxrd still scratched on my fist
If life be sending jabs, then I take them to the chin
Never gonna stagger, I still stand tall
Think you'll catch me flopping, nigga, I ain't got a glass jaw
Wake up in the morning and I browse upon my wish list
I'm prone to handle business, I get everything I ask for
I'm focused on getting higher
Old friends talk shit, say I'm a mean cunt
Had to work hard, I put faith in desire
Someone gave me this life on a plate, I'd be nicer
Stacks increased in my face, now I'm wiser
Every day long nights, I don't get tired
False claims is the game, I'm a lone survivor
Drugs come with the fame, I don't want neither
Dangerous form, I'm breaking the norm
I'm taking it all, believe in the storm, I'm raging of course
I got no problems, I've handled them all
There's just no stopping, I got talent, it's raw
Ducking from that broke nigga energy
If it ain't about the money, give it to my enemies
I've been workin' hard so I don't get to sleep
Plotting on the future, all my movements are hereditary

Fuck nigga, you don't want war
Spit bars around your head 'til it's gone
My mouth's got them clips in the jaw
Put you in the ground, then they mourn
Fuck nigga, you don't want war

Better than running in cribs
I can not stand all the talk that they spit, it's so shit
I lose sleep in the night when I think 'bout the biz
There's too much in my mind, I still think that I'm sick
All these racks that I've save, they don't save anything

Staying up all night n’ write, uh

I let you take my kindness and give it up
And I say no to violence because it's not enough
You're gonna fuck up for thinking that I'm weak
Put a mask on my face when I don't wanna speak
I will show you the passion you want to believe
I got several mansions and they’re all just for me (Yeah)
I just upped my percent
I'm not helping anyone, yeah (No way)
Pretentious little prince, uh (Oh yeah)
I'm a selfish-ass cunt
Don't rock chains so they think I'm poor
Mask on my face, don't watch my mouth
Head to the bank and I withdraw
Mad high numbers I can't count
I still get texts I ignore
Don't care 'bout no nigga with clout
Me, myself and I is all
They can't vibe or ride this route
Watch your tone
I been in the deep end
I don't want no help
Walk alone
Never need distractions from somebody else
Getting bigger
Yeah, I've been that figure
My tongue still a trigger
Leave them bitter
Life been giving lemons and they made me richer
Cunt, you're just a cunt
Do what I want, leave me alone
Take a percentage of shit that I run
They cannot catch up, I'm gone in the dust
Rippin' off heads, I want them dead
Won't forgive niggas for taking my bread
Fuck it, I'm blessed
Never been scared
I asked for stadium tours in my prayers
Watch me get it, bitch, uh
On my reckless shit, uh
Living legend, bitch, uh
My life’s easy, not tough

I pride myself on moving forward with some class, yeah
I let these niggas hate then I go buy another house

Throw my foot on the fucking gas, bitch, I like to speed
Digital dash, racking up miles on the map
Dodging and weave, never crash
Hide from the fact the shit that you did is in the past
But you would die for the cash
Never realising everything is just a vision
Can I keep myself together? Gotta keep the tunnel vision
Maybe killing off myself is something that of an envision
But I always find a way to hang on to an ambition, yeah, uh
Lately, I've been panicking, all my hope is slightly vanishing
My own life that I gamble with, this the motherfucking thanks I get

All these scars on my back, I know nothing's fine (DIE!)
Went to Hell, made it back and I'm still alive (Break!)
All this hatred of this world, it ain't ease my mind (Break!)
