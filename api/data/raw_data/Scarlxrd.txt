Nobody knows where my passion is
But they gon' know where the mansion is
I'm so cut throat, I can't manage it
Don't get too close, blow your ass to bits
When did my life turn to savageness?
Pick up the bond, and then plan this shit
I pop the shit in my cabinet
How can my body still handle this?

We all know that you're nervous
I can see it when you walk

Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time
Watching what you spend to control your mind
T-T-This is real salvation in the flesh
I-I-I do not care what they're thinking anyway (Fuck)

H-H-Hide your shame, so two-faced with the shit you say
Stay away, everything you do makes me so enraged
Wide awake, I can't fucking sleep or give my mind a break
Fuck, how can I support myself in such a state?
Why would I wait and assume this shit?
I put my heart and the truth in it
Niggas so blind that they shoot and miss
All of these scars, they consumed my wrist, yah
North Face on my coat, yuh
Better go change your tone, yah
What drugs help you cope? ayy
They don't need to know, yuh (Die)
Slipping isn't something that I like
But I be sliding like I'm skating when I rhyme, oh yah, oh yah
Creeping like a villain in the night
I got to keep myself together this time, oh yah, oh yah
Pedal to the metal when I drive
Wrestling with The Devil all the time, oh yah, oh yah
Jumping up a level at a time (Ayy)
Scar sound-waves can't die, oh yah, oh yah (Die)
Is it in your head like it is in mine?
All the hurt you shed, it won't save your life
They still want you dead, better take your time

These acts of mine, these facts I stay with
These hands of God, these hands I came with
I let them go, these days I regret
These doubtful flaws, I've got no patience

What you're looking at, is the aftermath of the grand jury deciding not to indict, Officer Wilson
Eurgh

Pretending everything is fine won't help
You say you're happy with the shit that sells
This fucking life really sounds like Hell
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself, eugh
I hope you're happy with the lies you tell yourself
Don't act like you're no sinner
This time, I shall not forget
This time, I rise from the dead
This time, I am not afraid
I don't see the meaning in these fucking games

(And why?)

Change facts, live fast, it helps us forget pain
Reach back, no thanks, I still go against grains
Point fingers away, don't blame 'til they break
Hype up and see your life's covered in flames
I'm so done with the waiting
Will I find my relief from this mind?
My whole body is craving
A better way of living my life

Eh yah yah, Scar, a-Lxrd, yeah
Laughing
Euh ah, blegh

Mind your business, lost control of all my feelings
I'm still sat here in this building
Fucking dying, fucking breathing
You're not happy, you're still bleeding
Your existence has no meaning
And it makes you fucking sick, eugh

Earth is a place in Hell

Pull up then I tear down every stigma that they made
They’ve been plotting on my downfall like I'm gonna change my ways
You live life for nothing
You’re so fucking disgusting
Everything you said to me
That shit wasn’t meant to be
There is nothing left for me
Death is the enemy
You live life for nothing
You’re so fucking disgusting
Clawing at my scars
They would heal if I ain’t touch it
I think staying sober's hard
Yeah, I put that shit out public
Wanna talk shit? Then go on
I can really handle judgment
Got these markings on my arm
Because I'm fucking self-destructive
There ain't shit that I'm proud of
I'm so sick of this household, we call Earth
I would love it, but it's fucking filled with assholes
B-B-Beat us down with passion, aye
We will go out laughing, aye
It's true to say I lost all my patience when I got betrayed
When I speak like a nihilist
They say I'm pushing for violence
When they are the serpents
That slither in silence
I like the hide on my own, aye
Helps me to chill and unload, aye
Nothin' but gas in the roach, aye
Grey clouds help me cope, aye
Doing fine for so long, yeah
Live life through my songs, aye
Wanna know what my life is like
I count cash all day long

Fuck clout, fuck numbers, fuck plans, fuck whores
I've been going in until my right hand's sore
I feel like the Jedi with the gold on my belt
You're too worried bout the bitches that be worried bout the wealth
Having big dreams is really bad for your health
I deserve this shit more than anybody else
Who are you, bitch? No one knows your name
But you're so hell bent on the drugs and the fame
Bite your tongue until it fucking bleeds and never speak again
Never told a soul all the pain I've been coping with
I've been on my own, get the fuck up out my face bitch
Better give me one good reason not to tear your limbs
You don't know my motherfucking story bitch you don't know shit

Open the door, never look back, leave me here in hell
Even the score spit on the track, maybe I'm tipping the scale
So you want more, they never ask
This is my cry for help
I told them before don't bring up my past, I might kill myself

Never told a soul all the pain I've been coping with
I've been on my own, get the fuck up out my face bitch
Better give me one good reason not to tear your limbs
You don't know my motherfucking story and you don't know shit

So stuck that you can't move
Really thinking that you're hurt 'cus you want to
I've been putting in the work like I got to
Big dreams in your head are they not true
Don't you let these motherfuckers try stop you
Don't be a bitch, get it like its not hard to
Get up and get it then
Harm your affiliates
