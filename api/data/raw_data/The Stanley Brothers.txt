Down the road here from me there's an old holler tree
Where you lay down a dollar or two
Go on round the bend come back again
There's a jug full of that good ole mountain dew

Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew
Now Mr. Roosevelt told 'em just how he felt
When he heard that the dry law 'd gone through
If your liquors too red it'll swell up your head
You better stick to that good ole mountain dew

The preacher rode by with his head hasted high
Said his wife had been down with the flu
He thought that I o'rt to sell him a quart of my good ole mountain dew

Well my uncle Snort he's sawed off and short he measures four feet two
But he feels like a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain dew

My latest sun is sinking fast
My race has nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph is begun
O come, angel band, come and around me stand
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
O bear my longing heart to Him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory
O come, angel band, come and around me stand
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I am the Man, Thomas, I am the Man
Look at these nail scars here in my hands
They drove me up the hill, Thomas, I am the Man
They made me carry the cross, Thomas, I am the Man
I am the Man, Thomas, I am the Man
Look at these nail scars here in my hands
They crown my head with thorns, Thomas, I am the Man
They nailed me to the cross, Thomas, I am the Man
They pierced me in the side, Thomas, I am the Man
I died on the cross, Thomas, I am the Man
They buried me in the tomb, Thomas, I am the Man
In three days I rose, Thomas, I am the ManEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, God spoke to Moses at the burning bush
Burning bush, Lord the burning bush
God spoke to Moses at the burning bush
Saying I am the Lord, thy God
Take your shoes off Moses you're on holy ground
Holy ground, you're on holy ground
Take your shoes off Moses you're on Holy ground
For I am the Lord, thy God
Go yonder Moses and smite that rock
Smite that rock, Lord smite that rock
Go yonder Moses and smite that rock
For I am the Lord, thy God
Stand still Moses see salvation work
Salvation work, see salvation work
Stand still Moses and see salvation work
For I am the Lord, thy GodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There waits for me a glad tomorrow
Where gates of pearl swing open wide
And when I've passed this vale of sorrow
I'll dwell upon the other side
Some day beyond the reach of mortal ken
Some day God only knows just where and when
The wheels of mortal life shall all stand still
And I shall go to dwell on Zion's hill
Some day I'll hear the angels singing
Beyond the shadows of the tomb;
And all the bells of heaven ringing
While saints are singing, "Home, sweet home."
Some day my labors will be ended
And all my wand'rings will be o'er
And all earth's broken ties be mended
And I shall sigh and weep no more
Some day the dark clouds will be rifted
And all the night of gloom be past;
And all life's burdens will be lifted
The day of rest shall dawn at lastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oft I sing for my friends
When death's cold hand I see
When I reach my journey's end
Who will sing one song for me
I wonder (I wonder) who
Will sing (will sing) for me
When I'm called to cross that silent sea
Who will sing for me
When friends shall gather round
And look down on me
Will they turn and walk away
Or will they sing one song for me
So I'll sing til the end
Contented I will be
Assured that some friends
Will sing one song for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I wandered again to my home in the mountains
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me
Now they've all moved away said the voice of a stranger
To a beautiful home by a bright crystal sea
And some day I'll meet them all up in Heaven
Where no one will be a rank stranger to meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was borned and raised
(The place where he was borned and raised)
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I find
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
(He has no friends to help him now)
It's fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train)
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
(While he is sleeping in his grave)
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There'll be shouting on the hills of glory
Shouting on the hills shouting on the hills
There'll be shouting on the hills of glory
There'll be shouting on the hills of God
Oh what a blessed reunion
Oh what a blessed reunion
When will we gather over yonder
There'll be shouting on the hills of God
No more sorrow in that city
No more sorrow in that city
Jesus prepared a place in heaven
There'll be shouting on the hills of God
Now's the time to make your preparations
Now's the time to make your preparations
So stop and make your reservation
There'll be shouting on the hills of GodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I heard about a man one day who wasted not his time away
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the things of man he trusted one who would not fail
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night
Oh, Daniel served the living God while here upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the kings decree he trusted God to set him free
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night
They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God soon got them
Safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night
Now brother, let us watch and pray like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
We too can gladly daring do the things that God will take us through
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
