Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time, I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me, don't let me down, oh

Although we've come to the end of the road (End of the road)
Still I can't let go (The end of the road and I know I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Baby, I'm here for you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alrright
Heh, I love you anyway (Baby, you tried)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me (Yeah, yeah)

(Lonely) Yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts, baby
(Lonely) Yes, I feel pain too
(Lonely) Baby, please

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road (We've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural (Baby), you belong to me (Baby), I belong to you (Baby)
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Alright, alright, alright)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you, woah)
Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
 
Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended...
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Wanna build a new life
Just you and me
Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family
 
Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all through the night

Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl, your wish is my command
I submit to your demands
I will do anything, girl, you need only ask

I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

Girl, relax, let's go slow
I ain't got nowhere to go
I'm just gonna concentrate on you
Girl, are you ready? It's gonna be a long night
Throw your clothes (Throw your clothes)
On the floor (On the floor)

I'm gonna take my clothes off, too
I've made plans to be within you
Girl, whatever you ask me, you know, I could do

I'll make love to you
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you
When you want me to
And I will not let go
'Til you tell me to

Baby, tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask
I will give you the love of your life, your life, your life

I'll make love to you (I'll make love)
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight (Hold you tight)
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you (I'll make love)
When you want me to
And I will not let go (Will not let go til you)
'Til you tell me to  (tell me to)
I'll make love to you  (I'll make love)
Like you want me to
And I'll hold you tight (Hold you tight)
Baby, all through the night
I'll make love to you  (I'll make love)
When you want me to
And I will not let go (Will not let go til you)
'Til you tell me to (Tell me to, tell me baby)
 
How do I say goodbye
To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad

I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through, ooh

If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
 
You taught me everything
Everything you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
You're the driving force in my life, yeah
There isn't anything
Or anyone that I could be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were gray
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be
What you have been to me you will always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times

Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know lovin' you is like food to my soul

You're always down for me
Have always been around for me even when I was bad
You showed me right from my wrong
Yes you did
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There ware so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you come to me and say to me
I can face anything
And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be, you will always be
The girl in my life, ooh oh

Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know lovin' you is like food to my soul

Never gonna go a day without you
Fills me up just thinkin' about you
I'll never go a day
Without my mama

Mama, Mama you know I love you
Mama, Mama you're the queen of my heart
Your love is like tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know lovin' you is like food to my soul
 
We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say "I love you" no more
Cause saying how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it, baby

Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow

Hey, it's another Christmas Holiday
It's a joyous thing let the angels sing
Cause we're together
We got a thing here, can't let it slip away
Though outside is rain and sleet
When our bodies meet...
I don't care 'bout the weather

Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Ohhhh, come over here and help me trim the tree
I wanna wrap you up baby
Then you'll see you're the only present I need
There's so much more
Waiting for you in store
From this precious day
I can gladly say
There's no place that I'd rather be

And ohhh, you are my everything, come a little closer
God must have sent you down from heaven

Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow baby, let it snow
I don't care about the weather baby
Let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow,
Let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow
I don't care 'bout the weather baby
All I need you to do is be with me baby
Let it snow
As long as you're here with me
Let it snow
I don't mind, I don't mind
Let it snow
I don't care what the weather may be
As long as you're here with me
 
I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

Remember
The warmth of
Days gone by
 
There was a time, when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
Cause it may seem hard to believe, but I

I'm doin' just fine, getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
But I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

You were my earth, my number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me, I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told
Me that you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone, all gone
Now you say you never meant to play your games
But girl don't you know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart

I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
But I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
I don't need you anymore

When you said goodbye, I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
Baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you at all

I'm fine, (I'm doin' just fine baby)
Getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
I'm fine (said I'm doin' just fine)
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

See, baby when you walked away
(I'm doing just fine)
You didn't think it would end up this way
(getting along very well without you in my life)
But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday
(I don't need you in my life)
Just as sure as my name is Wanya
Said I'm, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger your no longer on my mind
