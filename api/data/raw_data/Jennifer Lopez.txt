In love with the money, so no need to mingle (Let's ride)

I just want my money, chips, guap, and queso
Y'all can kiss my ass, dame un beso
Dominicana, drippin’ in designer
I got the juice, no Tropicana
I got the box that got the most flavor
Big fat cat like in the bodegas
Still making money moves (Yeah)
Tell me what you think (Yeah)
Merengue to the money (Woo)
Bachata to the bank (Oww)

I'll backhand a bitch like Serena
We need the guap, run up in your spot
Put it to your head like, "Give me what you got"
Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx
Cardi from the pole and Jenny from the block (Block)

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love…
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad (Don't bounce, baby)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (Uh)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have (Baby, don't go)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)

I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?
 
Letra de "Ni Tú Ni Yo" ft. Gente De Zona

¡Gente de Zona!
Lo mejor que suena ahora
JLo

Como en la vida, el amor es así
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor

El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Nada de lo que hagamos ahora es inmoral porque Cupido ya flechó
Si el amor es inmortal entonces la inmortalidad nos eligió
Tus labios son agua pura y mi mirada ya refleja el Kamasutra
Me gusta mi cama, pero prefiero la tuya

El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera
Porque a mi me da lo mismo
Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera

Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Que sea lo que Dios quiera (¡Motif! Yo te lo dije)
Lo hacemos a tu manera (Magnus, pero esta vez es con JLo)
Que sea lo que Dios quiera (lo mejor que suena ahora)
Lo hacemos a tu manera (desde Cuba, vamos a ver hasta que suba)

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (Yeah, yeah)

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
(You said that we could possibly spend eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams

And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah (How you knew)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Na, na, na, na, na)

You said you want my love and you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you trying to get with me (Don't want you)
(Don't want you trying to get with me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you
(So before I do give myself to you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave you trust)
Would you comfort me? What would you do, babe? Tell me right now
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (I need to know, be untrue)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't lie, don't you lie to me)

Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?
 
Oh, yeah

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh (Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
 
Me tratas como una princesa y me das lo que pido
Tú tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito
Cuando estamos solos, te juro, no me falta nada
Te pongo un trece de diez cuando estamo' en la cama

Nunca había sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
Tú me has dado tanto que he estado pensando
Ya lo tengo todo, pero...

¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Yeah, yeah)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Te tiene loca)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Yeah, yeah)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Te tiene loca)

Hueles como me gusta
Me besas como me gusta
Me agarras como me gusta
Así, así, que a mí me gusta
Como muerde la fruta (Wuh)
Si sale de noche, me asusta
Sin mapa conoces la ruta
Así, así, que me gusta
Sigue aquí, papi, estoy pa' ti
Dale atrás, que así somos las del Bronx
Don't stop, muévete más
Que siga la fiesta conmigo no más
No pierdas el enfoque
Papi, tienes la clase cuando apenas la toque
Home run con tres en base (damn, baby)

Nunca había sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
Tú me has dado tanto que he estado pensando
Ya lo tengo todo, pero-

¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Yeah, yeah)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Te tiene loca)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Yeah, yeah)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (Te tiene loca)
(Mira, yeah)

No te pido na', yo no soy mujer regala' (he)
Ponte en eso ya, si no papi, echa pa'llá, oh
Tú sabes que yo tengo lo que no tienen otras
Cuando muevo mi cuerpo, el tuyo se alborota
Las mujeres sabemos lo que nos toca
Si quieren todo eso, que nos pongan la roca

Nunca había sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
Tú me has dado tanto que he estado pensando
Ya lo tengo todo, pero...

¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (yeah)
(It's not like I need more jewelry, I mean)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando?
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (yeah, yeah)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (¿te gusta verme bailar?)
(Te tiene loca)
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando?
 
Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?

We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove, true

Hold up, I can get you fun up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up

Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage

Take the pins out her hair, drop to her knees (Whoop!)
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar (Omar)
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma (Haa)
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us (Haa, whoop!)
From the bottom it been real
From the bottom shorty been trill (Ha)
And even though we made it to the top
Still JLo from the-the the block
Ay, I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami

We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin, all the way to the end
And we started as friends, boy, I do love

Hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out you're shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Young Money

You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spellbound
Let me no other choice but to get down

It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, ah
It's too late, tell 'em
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, ah

When I look into your eyes, it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller (Yeah)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Come on, ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)

Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh

Listen, now I'm strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharpshooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, come on
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you (Ayy, hahah!)
I'm into you, yeah

Okay, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

When I look into your eyes, it's over (When I look into your eyes, baby, yeah)
You got me hooked with your love controller (I know)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Come on)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)
