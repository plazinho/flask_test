Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream

When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream
I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream

I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it—be--me2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain

Love hurts
Love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
It burns you when it's hot

Love hurts
Love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might've been

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurtin' me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
Rain drops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

I've got to stand tall, you know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears them passing by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad, that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses , that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown, that's Cathy's clown2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned bad
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her I had to see the world
Or tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please don't mention the stagecoach
And the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding day
But please don't mention my lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying day
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart's aching for Mary
Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold
Mary, Mary
Oh, Lord this cell is coldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

We've both been sound asleep
Wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over
It's four o'clock
And we're in trouble deep

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell all our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, I told your mama that
You'd be in by ten
Well, Susie, baby
Looks like we goofed again
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
We gotta go home

Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep
Our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothin' seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away, oh me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothin' seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away, oh me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day
I'm so lonesome every day

(Oooooooooo)
On a weekend pass I wouldn't have had time
To get home and marry, that baby of mine
So I went to the Chaplain and he authorized
Me to send for my Ebony Eyes
My Ebony Eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two, I would whisper "I do"
To my beautiful Ebony Eyes
Spoken:
The plane was way overdue
So I went inside to the airline's desk and I said:
"Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late"
He said: "Oh they probably took off late
Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course"
I went back outside and waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for –
My Ebony Eyes
And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker
"Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once"
Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life's most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
If I ever get, to heaven I'll bet
The first angel I'll recognise
She'll smile at me and I know she will be
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
(Ooooo)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat a-courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below
I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly
My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run, beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose ConnellyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How did I exist until I kissed ya
Never had you on my mind

Darlin' you can count on me
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then I'll always be devoted to you
I'll be yours through endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm devoted to you
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
I'll never be untrue
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years my love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
I'll never be untrue
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years my love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Johnny is the joker (he's a bird)
A very funny joker (he's a bird)
But when he jokes my honey (he's a dog)
His jokin' ain't so funny (what a dog)
Johnny is the joker that's been tryin' to steal my baby (he's a bird dog)
Johnny sings a love song (like a bird)
He sings the sweetest love song (you ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal (what a howl)
To me it's just a wolf dog (on the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy love my baby (he's a bird dog)

Hey bird dog, get away from my quail
Hey bird dog, you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog, get away from my chick
Hey bird dog, you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own
Johnny kissed the teacher (he's a bird)
He tip-toed up to reach her (he's a bird)
Well, he's the teachers pet now (he's a dog)
What he wants he can get now (what a dog)
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby (he's a bird dog)
Hey bird dog, get away from my quail
Hey bird dog, you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog, get away from my chick

I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved
I've been turned down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved

When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
When will I be loved1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Like strangers
That's what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far?
Like strangers
How can it be?
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly
I love you, truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too
Let's forget that we've been angry
Let's be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers, anymore
Let's forget that we've been angry
Let's be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers, anymoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
"I'm not in your town to stay,"
Said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
"I'm not in your town to stay
And I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail"
"I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden
At last I've found my baby here in jail"
"It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
T’was then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden
The county laid his daddy in the grave"
"I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
If that will get my baby out of jail"
Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
"I'll go bring your darling baby to your side"
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
"I'm not in your town to stay,"
Said a lady old and gray
"I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
All these many years I've loved you
No-one has ever known
No-one has ever known but you alone
I've kept it locked inside my heart
And smiled through all my tears
My darling, I have loved you oh so many years
Each night within my lonely room
I cry dear, over you
And pray to God that things will turn out right
But when the dawn of day appears
I brush away my tears
My darling, I have loved you oh so many years
I'll go on pretending that my life is oh so gay
And happy dear without you by my side
When all the time my heart is
Longing just to have you near
My darling I have loved you oh so many years
Maybe fate will lead us down a path where we will meet again
And then we will be free to love anew
Then one sweet kiss from your dear lips
Will banish all my fears
My darling I have loved you oh so many yearsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We used to have good times together
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad

Remember how you used to feel, dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart, to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad

Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you

Remember how you used to feel, dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart, to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad

So sad to watch good love go badEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Some sunny day, baby
When everything seems OK, baby
You'll wake up and find that you're alone
'Cause I'll be gone
Gone gone gone
Really gone
Done moved on
'Cause you done me wrong
Everyone that you meet, baby
As you walk down the street, baby
Will ask you why you're walking all alone
Why you're on your own
Just say I'm gone
Gone gone gone
Done moved on
'Cause you done me wrong
If you change your way, baby
You might get me to stay, baby
Better hurry up if you don't want to be alone
Or I'll be gone
Gone gone gone
Really gone
Done moved on
'Cause you done me wrongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
