Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream

When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream

I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
 
I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it—be--me
 
Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain

Love hurts
Love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
It burns you when it's hot

Love hurts
Love hurts

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts
 
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might've been

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
 
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurtin' me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
Rain drops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
 
Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

I've got to stand tall, you know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears them passing by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad, that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses , that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown, that's Cathy's clown
 
These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned bad
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her I had to see the world
Or tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please don't mention the stagecoach
And the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding day
But please don't mention my lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying day
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart's aching for Mary
Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold
Mary, Mary
Oh, Lord this cell is cold
 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

We've both been sound asleep
Wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over
It's four o'clock
And we're in trouble deep

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell all our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, I told your mama that
You'd be in by ten
Well, Susie, baby
Looks like we goofed again
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
We gotta go home

Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep
Our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
 
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothin' seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away, oh me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
I'm so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothin' seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away, oh me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me, don't send it
I'm so lonesome every day
I'm so lonesome every day
I'm so lonesome every day
 
(Oooooooooo)
On a weekend pass I wouldn't have had time
To get home and marry, that baby of mine
So I went to the Chaplain and he authorized
Me to send for my Ebony Eyes
My Ebony Eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two, I would whisper "I do"
To my beautiful Ebony Eyes
Spoken:
The plane was way overdue
So I went inside to the airline's desk and I said:
"Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late"
He said: "Oh they probably took off late
Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course"
I went back outside and waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for –
My Ebony Eyes
And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker
"Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once"
Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life's most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
If I ever get, to heaven I'll bet
The first angel I'll recognise
She'll smile at me and I know she will be
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
(Ooooo)
