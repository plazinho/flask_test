I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah!

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)

Every timeâ€‹ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away


Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear

There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me

Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me

'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me
Baby, baby, baby

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet
I was cryin' when I met you
 
Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this


Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Just give me a kiss
Like this
 
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

That kinda loving
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy

Crazy, crazy, crazy, I go crazy
You turn it on

Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on, then your gone

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year


Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did


You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand

Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!

That, that dude looks like a lady

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?

They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

She said, "'Cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same"

Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....


"So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night."
