Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Cool town, evenin' in the city
Dressin' so fine and lookin' so pretty
Cool cat, lookin' for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
'Til I'm wheezin' like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city

Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face in somebody's new-mowed lawn
I've been havin' a sweet dream
I've been dreamin' since I woke up today
It's starrin' me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for droppin' my load
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy bull toad
And you can be sure that if you're feelin' right
A daydream will last along into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be dreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Come and talk of all the things we did today
Hear and laugh about our funny little ways
While we have a few minutes to breathe
And I know that it's time you must leave

But darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

And now a quarter of my life is almost past
I think I've come to see myself at last
And I see that the time spent confused
Was the time that I spent without you
And I feel myself in bloom

So darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

So darling, my darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

Go and beat your crazy head against the sky
Try and see beyond the houses and your eyes
It's okay to shoot the moon

Darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was down in Savannah
Eatin' cream and bananas
When the heat just made me faint
I began to get cross-eyed
I thought I was lost, I'd
Begun to see things as they ain't
As the relatives gathered
To see what's the matter
The doctor came to see was I dyin'
But the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
I was told a little tale
About a skinny as a rail
Eight-foot cowboy with a headache
He was hung-up in the desert slottin' rats
And tryin' to get a drink of water
With his knees a-gettin' mud-caked
And I'll tell you in a sentence
How he stumbled into Memphis
Tennessee, hardly crawlin' lookin' dust-baked
We gave him little water, a little bit of wine
He opened up his eyes
But they didn't seem to shine
And the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
So, if you ever get sickly
Get sis to run quickly
To the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard
And play a guitar chord
And do a little do-it-yourself
Call on your neighbors
To put down their labors
And come and play the hardware in time
'Cause the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
I was floatin' in the ocean
Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy
He was surfin' when he hit me
But jumped off his board to get me
And he dragged me by the armpit
Like a child's toy
As we staggered into land
With all the waders eatin' sandwiches
And tried to mooch a towel from the hoi polloi
He emptied out his eardrums
I emptied out mine
And everybody knows that the very last line
Is the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
And the doctor said "Give him jug band music

Don't give me a place for my memories to stay
Don't show me an end or a light to find the way
I ain't got time for the things on your mind
And I'm leavin' you today
On my way

Please don't you cry when the time to part has come
It's not for what you've said or anything that you've done
I've got to go anywhere any time
And I'm leavin', gone today
On my way
I'm goin' home


Please don't stick around to see me when I'm feelin' low
Don't pass the cards to me to deal the crushin' blow
I'll even close the door so you won't see me go
When I'm leavin', gone today
I'm on my way

I'll walk away like a shadow in the night
I won't give cause for you to feel we have to fight
I'll make it easy so that you won't really - quite
Know I'm leavin' you today
On my way
And now I'm goin'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's really true how nothin' matters
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters
In Coconut Grove
Don't bar the door, there's no one comin'
The ocean's roar will dull the drummin'
Of any city thoughts and city ways
The ocean breezes cool my mind
The salty days are hers and mine
Just to do what we want to
Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly she will speak the stars
Until sunup
It's all from havin' someone knowin'
Just which way your head is blowin'
Who's always warm, like in the mornin'
In Coconut Grove
The ocean breezes cool my mind
The salty days are hers and mine
Just do what we want to
Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly she will speak the stars
Until sun-up
It's really true how nothin' matters
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters

Why must every generation think their folks are square?
And no matter where their heads are they know mom's ain't there
Cause I swore when I was small that I'd remember when
I knew what's wrong with them that I was smaller than

Determined to remember all the cardinal rules
Like sun showers are legal grounds for cutting school
I know I have forgotten maybe one or two
And I hope that I recall them all before the baby's due
And I know he'll have a question or two

Like "Hey pop, can I go ride my zoom?
It goes two hundred miles an hour suspended on balloons
And can I put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue
And imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?"
And I must be permissive, understanding of the younger generation

And then I'll know that all I've learned my kid assumes
And all my deepest worries must be his cartoons
And still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done
Relating to what he can do when he becomes a man
And still he'll stick his fingers in the fan
And "Hey pop, my girlfriend's only three
She's got her own videophone and she's a taking LSD
And now that we're best friends, she wants to give a bit to me
And what's the matter, daddy?  How come you're turning green?
Can it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
You pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Did you ever have to finally decide?
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl

And then you know you better make up your mind
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you a line
And says, "Better go home, son, and make up your mind"

Then you bet you'd better finally decide
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You didn't have to be so nice
I would have liked you anyway
If you had just looked once or twice
And gone upon your quiet way
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
And it's true
You came upon a quiet day
You simply seemed to take your place
I knew that it would be that way
The minute that I saw your face
And when we've had a few more days (When we've had a few more days)
I wonder if I'll get to say (Wonder if I'll get to say)
You didn't have to be so nice (Be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked)
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you (Today, said that the time was right to follow you)
I knew I'd find you in a day or two (I knew that I would find you in a day or two)
And it's true
You didn't have to be so nice (Didn't have to be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked you anyway)
If you had just looked once or twice (Once or twice)
And gone upon your quiet way (Quiet way)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
