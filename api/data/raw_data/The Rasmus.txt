No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer

Sometimes
I feel like goin' down
I'm so disconnected
Somehow
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows, all my life
In the shadows

They say
That I must learn to kill
Before I can feel safe
But I, I'd rather kill myself
Than turn into their slave

Sometimes
I feel that I should go
And play with the thunder
Somehow
I just don't wanna stay
And wait for a wonder

I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows, all my life

Lately, I've been
Walkin', walkin'
In circles, watchin'
Waitin' for somethin'
Feel me, touch me
Heal me, come, take me higher

I've been watchin', I've been waitin'
In the shadows for my time
I've been searchin', I've been livin'
For tomorrows, all my life

I've been watchin'
I've been waitin'
I've been searchin'
I've been livin' for tomorrows
In the shadows
I've been waitin'
 
It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralyzed my body with a poisoned kiss
For forty days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom came alive
Livin' in a world without you

You told me, "My darling
Without me, you're nothing"
You taught me, to look in your eyes
And fed me, your sweet lies

Suddenly someone was there in the window
Looking outside at the sky that had never been blue

Oh oh oh oh
There's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh oh oh oh
There is hope to guide me
I will survive
Livin' in a world without you

It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralyzed my body with a poisoned kiss
For forty days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Then something inside me called freedom came alive
Livin' in a world without you

You put me, together
Then trashed me, for pleasure
You used me, again and again
Abused me, confused me

Suddenly naked, I run through your garden
Right through the gates of the past and I'm finally free

Oh oh oh oh
There's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh oh oh oh
There is hope to guide me
I will survive
Livin' in a world without you

It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss (Livin' in a world without you)
For fourty days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom came alive
Livin' in a world without you
It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss
For fourty days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom came alive
Livin' in a world without you

Oh oh oh oh
There's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh oh oh oh
There is hope to guide me
I will survive
Livin' in a world without you

Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
 
I'm dead, but I'm living
I played a part I've been given
I'm still kicked out of heaven
I'm into nothing new
Everyday is a battle
I made a deal with the devil
And I'm deep into trouble
So tired
I was trying to find a better way but every day's the same
I'm trying to break the numbness and it's driving me insane
You could be my saviour, you could be just what I need
So I lay down and pray for something better
Go ahead and leave me paralyzed
There's nothing left to sacrifice
In hell I'm shooting paradise
I'm ready so I'll close my eyes
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
It's gonna hurt but I'm ready
It's clear where I'm heading
Don't call paramedics
I'm into nothing new
I'll be gone in a minute
I'm not afraid to admit it
So wrong but I love it
So tired
I was trying to find a better way but every day's the same
I'm trying to break the numbness and it's driving me insane
You could be my saviour, you could be just what I need
So I lay down and pray for something better
Go ahead and leave me paralyzed
There's nothing left to sacrifice
In hell I'm shooting paradise
I'm ready so I'll close my eyes
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
I made a deal with the devil
Everyday is a battle
Everyday is a battle
This is my paradise
I made a deal with the devil
Everyday is a battle
Everyday is a battle
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
This is my paradise
 
I have always been around
But you never really noticed
Cause I don't draw a lot of attention
I'm a stranger in a crowd
Blame it on the evolution
Trying to find a way to say this

I've been living in a hurricane
I've been running in the stormy raine
I've been lying on the razor blades
All I wanted was to kill the pain
I've been giving all my life for you
Cause I laugh and I cry for you
Anything to be close to you

All by myself, all by myself
All by my ordinary solitary self
I still believe we live for the pain
And someday the stranger in the corner wins the game
And gets the crown
Gets the girl
The Holy Grail

Days go on with no remorse
I heard you're gonna throw a party
They say it's gonna be amazing
Surrounded by these silent walls
Who are they to say I'm crazy
It's something that they can't imagine

Cause I'm living in a paradise
Every time when I close my eyes
Now it's never gonna be the same
All I wanted was to kill the pain
I've been giving all my life for you
Cause I live and I die for you
Still I'm nothing but a ghost to you

All by myself, all by myself
All by my ordinary solitary self
I still believe we live for the pain
And someday the stranger in the corner wins the game
And gets the crown
Gets the girl
The Holy Grail

Someday
The stranger in the corner gets the girl
Somehow
I stand against the laws of universe

I have always been around
But you never really noticed
 
She was like April sky
Sunrise in her eyes
Child of light
Shining star
Fire in her heart
Brightest day
Melting snow
Breaking through the chill
October and April
He was like frozen sky
In October night
Darkest cloud
Endless storm
Raining from his heart
Coldest moon
Deepest blue
Tearing down the spring
October and April
Like hate and love
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Like light and dark
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
We were like loaded guns
Sacrificed our lives
We were like love undone
Craving to entwine
Fatal touch
Final thrill
Love was bound to kill
October and April
Like hate and love
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Like light and dark
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Hate and love
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Light and dark
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
October and April
October and April
October and April
 
Once upon a time we had a lot to fight for
We had a dream, we had a plan
Sparks in the air – we spread a lot of envy
Didn't have to care once upon a time
Remember when I swore
My love is never ending
And you and I will never die
Remember when I swore
We had it all
We had it all
Sail away
It's time to leave
Rainy days
Are yours to keep
Fade away
The night is calling my name
You will stay
I'll sail away
Once upon a time we used to burn candles
We had a place to call a home
The dream that we lived
Was better than divine
Every day was like a gift
Once upon a time
Remember when you swore
Your love is never ending
And you and I will never die
Remember when you swore
We had it all
We'd never fall
Sail away
It's time to leave
Rainy days
Are yours to keep
Fade away
The night is calling my name
You will stay
I'll sail away
No reason to lie
No need to pretend
I'm grateful to die
To live once again
I'm fearless to fly
And reach for the end
And reach for the end
Sail away
Sail away
It's time to leave
Rainy days
Are yours to keep
Fade away
The night is calling my name
You will stay
I'll sail away
Sail away
The night is calling my name
Sail away
 
In my mind, I always thought I was a different kind
'Cause back in time I used to think that everyone was blind
They always call me as a loser - zero
When I look into the mirror there's a superhero
People thought that I would never amount to anything
Dream away the thing my thoughts were different then
Never could express myself to differ words right
But I'm a different man when day turns to night

You think I'm crazy, that I've lost my senses
The world finally will finally learn the truth

You, you wouldn't understand
'Cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman

Kind of shy, kind of timid, not a go-getter
Every night I roam the streets try to make it better
Hate slow me up I never was bitter
Always fighting for what's right, but I'm not a quitter
When you step into my world you might not understand
Everybody's acting crazy, getting out of hand
I might bend the law a bit, but I will not break it
Just make it easy for the underdogs that take it

You think I'm crazy, that I've lost my senses
The world finally will finally learn the truth

You, you wouldn't understand
'Cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman

This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory

You, you wouldn't understand
'Cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman
 
Woah
Yeah

I feel guilty
My words are empty
No signs to give you
Don't have the time for you
You say I'm heartless
And you say I don't care
I used to be there for you

You've said I seem so dead
That I have changed
But so have you

Guilty (woah)
Guilty
I feel so empty (yeah)
Empty
You know how you make me feel

I put a shield upon you
I didn't mean to hurt you
Would've only poisoned your mind
Never meant to make you cry
You've been so thoughtless
I can see right through you
You used to be there for me

Don't you leave and say goodbye
Cause you have changed
But so have I

Guilty (woah)
Guilty
I feel so empty (yeah)
Empty
You know how you make me feel

I never thought that the time and the distance
Between us made you so much colder
I'll carry the world on my shoulders

Guilty
Woah!
Guilty
Yeah!
Guilty
Guilty (woah)
Empty (yeah)

Guilty (woah)
Guilty
I feel so empty (yeah)
Empty
You know how to make me feel
Guilty (woah)
Empty (yeah)
You know how to make me feel

Guilty (woah), so guilty
Empty (woah), so empty
You know how to make me feel
 
I rest my case every time we kissed it left a bitter taste
On your cold lips, baby it was something that we couldn't fix
No way no way, no way no way
I can't change, can't change my ways
I hate to see you leaving but I love to watch you go
Keep staring at the ceiling when my world's about to blow
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
Let the walls come down and face the fire
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
Let the walls come down
Eighteen and life, did you ever think it would be like this?
He's got my eyes as well as whatever habits, let it be a bliss
No way no way, no way no way
You can't change, can't change your ways
I hate to see you leaving but I love to watch you go
Keep staring at the ceiling when my world's about to blow
And I could chase the melody but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
Let the walls come down and face the fire
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
Let the walls come down
I hate to see you leaving, but I love to watch you go
Keep staring at the ceiling when my world's about to blow
And I could chase the melody, but I let you down
I play the darkest symphony when you're around
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
The end of my empire
 
Here, lonely and marooned
Here, howling at the moon
So I'll wait in silence, silence, silence

There’s footprints in the snow
I'll follow wherever you go
I'll be the lonely wolf
(I'll be the lonely wolf)
I'll follow wherever you go

In the silver night
The silver night
In the silver night
The silver night

Here, not a single light
Here, in the darkest night
And the sound of silence, silence, silence
Here, this is where I reign
Hear me calling out no name
So I'll stay in silence, silence

There’s footprints in the snow
I'll follow wherever you go
I'll be the lonely wolf
I'll follow wherever you go

In the silver night
The silver night
In the silver night
The silver night

Here, lonely and marooned
I will wait
In silence, silence, silence

There’s footprints in the snow
I'll follow wherever you go
I'll be the lonely wolf
I'll follow wherever you go

In the silver night
The silver night
In the silver night
The silver night

In the silver night
The silver night
 
Feels like I'm stoned
I wanna be alone
Just for a while, unknown
Weeks on the road
A long way from home
Just shut off the phone

And you say I'll heal you
I'll always be yours
And you say I'll kill you
If I do something wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Still feels like the first time
To stand here by your side
Together regardless
We'll walk through the darkness
Still feels like the first day of my life

Remember the times
Together we swore
Never give up this life
Still hanging on
Still going strong
Here I belong

And maybe I'm crazy
But I just can't slow down
And maybe I'm crazy
But at least I'm still around
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Still feels like the first time
To stand here by your side
Together regardless
We'll walk through the darkness
Still feels like the first day of my life

Feels like the first day of my life
Feels like the first time
Still feels like the first day of my life

Still feels like the first time
To stand here by your side
Together regardless
We'll walk through the darkness
Still feels like the first day of my
Still feels like the first day of my
Still feels like the first day of my life
 
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
No way out
Scream so loud
It makes no sound
It holds me down
It pulls me in
Grabs my soul
I can't say no
So I let go
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the)
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the)
(Something in the)
Feel so free
Like I can fly
Inside my dreams
I feel like me
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the)
(Something in the)
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the)
(Something in the)
Something in the dark
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
(Something in the)
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart
Something in the dark is on it's way
Beating of my heart it's not the same
Something in the dark calls out my name
It's tearing me apart

Girl
You lived your life like a sleeping swan
Your time has come
To go deeper
Girl
The final journey has just begun
Your destiny
Chose the reaper
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Girl
Rain falls down from the northern skies
Like poisoned knives
With no mercy
Girl
Close your eyes for the one last time
Sleepless nights
From here to eternity
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
(Destination darkness)
(Destination darkness)
Ooooh
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
Ooooh
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
Destination darkness
No fear
 
I dumped you again
Don't understand
It's happened before
Can't take it no more
These foolish games
Always end up in confusion
I'll take you back
Just to leave you once again

I died in my dreams
What's that supposed to mean?
Got lost in the fire
I died in my dreams
Reaching out for your hand
My fatal desire

I failed you again
Cause I let you stay
I used to pretend
That I felt OK
Just one big lie
Such a perfect illusion
I made you mine
Just to hurt you once again

I died in my dreams
What's that supposed to mean?
Got lost in the fire
I died in my dreams
Reaching out for your hand
My fatal desire
 
So close, so far
I'm lost in time
Ready to follow a sign
If there was only a sign
The last goodbye burns in my mind
Why did I leave you behind?
Guess it was too high to climb
Give me a reason
Why would you want me to live and die
Living a lie?
You were the answer
All that I needed to justify
Justify my life
Someone as beautiful as you
Could do much better it's true
That didn't matter to you
I tried so hard to be the one
It's something I couldn't do
Guess I was under the gun
Give me a reason
Why would you want me to live and die
Living a lie?
You were the answer
All that I needed to justify
Justify my life
It's only right
That I should go
I find myself
Before I go and ruin someone else
So close so far
I'm lost in time
Ready to follow a sign
If there was only a sign
Give me a reason
Why would you want me to live and die
Living a lie?
You were the answer
All that I needed to justify
Justify my life
It's only right
That I should go
I find myself
Before I go and ruin someone else
 
No more blame
I am destined to keep you sane
Gotta rescue the flame
Gotta rescue the flame in your heart
No more blood
I will be there for you, my love
I will stand by your side
The world has forsaken my girl

Should have seen it would be this way
Should have known from the start what she's up to
When you've loved and you've lost someone
You know what it feels like to lose

She's fading away
Away from this world
Drifting like a feather
She's not like the other girls
She lives in the clouds
And talks to the birds
Hopeless little one
She's not like the other girls
I know

No more shame
She has felt too much pain
In her life, in her mind
She's repeating the words
All the love you put out will return to you

Should have seen it would be this way
Should have known from the start what she's up to
When you loved and you've lost someone close to you
You know what it feels like to lose

She's fading away
Away from this world
Drifting like a feather
She's not like the other girls
She lives in the clouds
And talks to the birds
Hopeless little one
She's not like the other girls
I know

She's fading away
Away from this world
Drifting like a feather
She's not like the other girls
She lives in the clouds
And talks to the birds
Hopeless little one
She's not like the other girls
I know
 
For whatever it's worth
Yeah you've got it
You know I love when it hurts
I can't deny it
Always put myself right in front of the front row
Spending all my cash on the ones with no halo
Spilling gasoline on my 100k Steinway
Doing my way

For whatever it's worth
I never meant to hurt you bad just needed something
For whatever it's worth
I'm playing along but we're just holding on to nothing, nothing

Holding on to nothing, nothing, nothing
Holding on to nothing
Holding on to no one, no one, no one
Holding on to nothing

For whatever it's worth
I give you nada
I know it's gonna get worse
Just go you gotta
Take another sip I'm unleashing the dragon
Spinning in my whip 63g wagon
Take a last glance in my rear view mirror
It's so clear now

For whatever it's worth
I never meant to hurt you bad just needed something
For whatever it's worth
I'm playing along but we're just holding on to nothing, nothing

Holding on to nothing, nothing, nothing
Holding on to nothing
Holding on to no one, no one, no one
Holding on to nothing

Always put myself right in front of the front row
Spending all my cash on the ones with no halo
Spilling gasoline on my 100k Steinway
Doing my way
Take another sip I'm unleashing the dragon
Spinning in my whip 63g wagon
Take a last glance in my rear view mirror
It's so clear now

Holding on to nothing, nothing, nothing
Holding on to nothing
Holding on to no one, no one, no one
Holding on to nothing
Holding on to nothing, nothing, nothing
Holding on to nothing
Holding on to no one, no one, no one
Holding on to nothing
 
My heart is hidden
Forbidden
Can't be forgiven
All the faith is on the line
The end is written
I pretend
It's a mistake
I orchestrate my own decline
You think you know me
You hold me just like you own me
Living in a perfect lie
I face the karma for all the pain and drama
I feel like I was buried alive
And every time you kiss me
My heart turns into stone
And every time you touch me
Darkness grips on my bonеs
My bones
I hide a secrеt
So twisted
It hurts to keep it quiet deep inside my mind
I've been mistaken
Forsaken
There's no escaping
Something keeps me up at night
I crawl in her bed
I feel no regret
I hear your voice inside my head
'Cause I betrayed you
In your weakest moment
I know that I deserve to be dead
And every time you kiss me
My heart turns into stone
And every time you touch me
Darkness grips on my bones
When you hold me
And every time you touch me
Darkness grips on my bones
My bones
My bones
 
Feel the heat below my feet
I have to go, no time to sleep
Can't believe the things you say
I turn my head and walk away
You make me sick, you make me nervous
Times are gone when you would say
This is the one and seize the day
Times are gone for honesty
"My victory is your defeat"
Can't you see you've been mistaken

In my life I decide and it turns me on
How I am, how I live, who I love
Yeah
In my way I feel strong
And it turns me on
In my life I decide, I decide
I decide

All you do, you can't deny
Is waste of time and waste of life
Can I suggest that you invest
In something more than hopelessness
Before you know the ride is over

In my life I decide and it turns me on
How I am, how I live, who I love, yeah
In my way, I feel strong
And it turns me on
In my life, I decide, I decide

It's up to you if you give it up
It's up to you if you won't stop
It's up to you if you give it up
It's up to you if you won't stop
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up
It's up to you if you won't stop
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up
It's up to you, it's up to you

The record shows that you're dead but you're still living
Every time you have died you have been given
Another chance to fix your bad attitude
And make a move, it's up to you

It's up to you if you give it up, give it up
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up
It's up to you
It's up to you

You
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
 
Behind those eyes lies the truth and grief
Behind those beautiful smiles I've seen tragedy
The flawless skin hides the secrets within
Silent forces that secretly ignite your sins
Fly away, fly away
From the torch of blame
They haunt you
The Lucifer's Angels
Never lived, you never died
Your life has been denied
They call you
The Lucifer's Angel
Beyond these clouds you can hide all your tears
Beyond this world you'll be safe from their wicked fears
And in their hearts they fear your demands
You know their minds won't accept you, they'll never understand
Fly away, fly away
From the torch of blame
They haunt you
The Lucifer's Angels
Never lived, you never died
Your life has been denied
They call you
The Lucifer's Angel
On your own I know you can make it
Truth or bone. I know you can shake it
Survive alone I know you can take it
Fly away, fly away
From the torch of blame
They haunt you
Lucifer's Angels
You never lived, you never died
Your life has been denied
They call you
Lucifer's Angel
Fly away, fly away
Run away, run away
Hide away, hide away
Lucifer's Angel
