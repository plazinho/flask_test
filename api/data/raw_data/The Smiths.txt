Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
 
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"
Naaa nana nana nana, this charming man
Naaa nana nana nana, this charming man

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over...

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over
Over and over...
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said:

"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms..."

It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
 
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does


There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die

When you say "it's gonna happen now"
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone


You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
 
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (Oh)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)

Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt (Oh)
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh)
 
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"Oh, you've been in the house too long", she said
And I naturally fled

In my life, why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
"Oh, you've been in the house too long", she said
And I naturally fled

In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?
 
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone

Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

There is another world
There is a better world
There must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well

Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye
 
Oh, take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere
Drop me anywhere
In Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
But I don't care
I should like to seeâ€”

I don't bless them

Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)

So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said, "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said, "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration
(Oh, oh-oh)

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty, oh, oh
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair, oh
(These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
 
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives, where are they now?
With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived, and then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry
You say: "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall
You say: "'Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804

A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on mine
Sugar!
 
Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had can make a good man turn bad
So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had can make a good man bad
So, for once in my life, let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
