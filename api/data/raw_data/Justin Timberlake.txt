Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I’ll be there to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

Everybody says, "Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me tonight (Whoa)
I hear them call my name

Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance (Come on)
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So keep dancing
Come on

Oh, yeah
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling!

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling!)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body, come on
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
I can't stop the feeling!
Got this feeling in my body, come on
 
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying "I do")
Because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love

Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, love, my love, my love

Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!

It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you, yeah

Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, 'cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say

'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it, babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me

I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
Cause I'm in love with that girl
 
Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
 
Hey pretty lady
This goes out to you (This goes out to you, you, you)
I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
(This goes out to you, you, you)
This is dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk on by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow

I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey

If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I'll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you’d be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop


Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
Then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop

And then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
Hey, hey, hey
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum

My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(Little girl, would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’ll love you 'til I make it pop
 
Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh

Don't wanna think about it (Uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (Uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were movin' on now (On now)
And maybe I should do the same (Maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong, uh

Don't wanna think about it (No)
Don't wanna talk about it (Hmm)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)

Now it's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
That's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around

(Now it's breakin' my heart)
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah


Yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby, yep

You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(Take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Hahahaha
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, Take it to 'em)
See, you should've listened to me, baby
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Take it to 'em)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey Girl)
Because (What goes around comes back around)
Hahahaha
 
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you’ll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me (Staring back at me)
'Cause I know that’s a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
(Don't you know) But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)

No, I won’t fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

Don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
 
Hey, hey, hey, come on
We're having too much fun right here

She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
'Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger

Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I’ll keep a secret for ya

I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

It's a cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

Everybody's looking for the fliest thing to say (Fliest thing to say)
But I just want to fly (fly away with you, you, you, you)
I don't want to be the one to alienate, yeah (Alienate)
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you (you) if it's cool, (Cool)

We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
(Would you like that?)
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me (Yeah)

Now everybody knows that you're from outer space (Outer space)
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you (You, you, you)
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah (That milky way)
And sugar, I'll take my time
And show you the backseat view, (view) if it's cool (Cool)

We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (And that's me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe

Where you, and me, and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away

Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

I don't know if you 'member this, but I was out of town
Flew in on a 3 AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that

'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl (okay)
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay)

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
