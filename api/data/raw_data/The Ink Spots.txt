I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don't wanna set the world on fire, honey
I love you too much
I just wanna start a great big flame down in your heart
You see, way down inside of me
Darling, I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know, nobody else ain't gonna do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just wanna be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's all over but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you
It's all over but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you

It's all over but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you
It's all over but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Maybe
You'll think of me, when you are all alone
Maybe, the one who is waiting for you
Will prove untrue
Then what will you do?

Maybe, you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near
Then, maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe
I'll say, "maybe."

If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, baby, would I feel this way?
Darlin', if this isnâ€™t love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart just stands still so much?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much, too much is fallin' in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine
Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, boy
I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops, Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot
Shoot me the pot now pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup
Oh, slip me a slug from the wonderful mug
I'll cut a rug till I'm snug in a jug
A slice of onion and a raw one, draw one
Waiter, waiter, percolator
I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup
Oh, Boston beans, soy beans (Yeah!)
Green beans, cabbage and greens (Home cooking!)
I'm not keen for a bean
Unless that is a cheery, cheery bean, boy
I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and the tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, yeah
I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops, Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot
Shoot me the pot now pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup (Yeah!)
Oh, throw me that slug from the wonderful mug
And I'll cut a rug till I'm snug in the jug
Drop a nickel in a pot, Joe, takin' it slow
Waiter, waiter, percolator
I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me

Be sure it's true when you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true
When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Be sure it's true when you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true
When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day
Keep smiling through, just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away
So will you please say hello to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day

Yeah, we'll meet again
I don't know where, and I don't know when
But I do know that we'll meet again some sunny day
So honey, keep on smilin' through
Just like you always do
'Till the blue skies drive all the dark clouds far away
And will you please say hello to all the folks that I know
And tell 'em that I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Address Unknown - not even a trace of you
Oh what I'd give to see the face of you
I was a fool to stay away from you so long
I should have known there'd come a day when you'd be gone

Address Unknown - oh how could I be so blind?
To think that you would never be hard to find?
From the place of your birth to the ends of the earth
I've searched only to find - only to find - Address Unknown

Address Unknown - honey child, I ain't even got a trace of ya
You know one thing?
I'd give anything in the world just to see the face of ya
I was a fool to stay away from you and everything else so long
I should have been diplomatic and figured that some day
You'd be solid gone

We three
We're all alone
Living in a memory
My echo, my shadow, and me
We three
We're not a crowd
We're not even company
My echo, my shadow, and me
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo
But where is the one I love?
We three
We'll wait for you
Even 'till eternity
My echo, my shadow, and me
We three
We're all alone
Seems like we're living in a memory
That's my echo, my shadow, and me
We three
We're no crowd
Fact is, we ain't even company
That's my echo, my shadow, and me
You know, I've been wondering
What good is the moonlight
That silvery moonlight
That shines way, way up above
Yeah, I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo
But where is that gal that I love?
We three
We'll wait for you
Even 'till eternity
My echo, my shadow, and meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life are free
The stars belong to everyone
They gleam there for you and me
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine
And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free
Honey, the moon belongs to everyone
You know the best things in life are free
And the stars, they belong to everyone
They're shining up there for you and for me
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine
And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free
The best things in life are freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In a quaint caravan
There's a lady they call the Gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears
Everything will come right
If you only believe the Gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears
She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday

You see, she looked at my hand and told me that my baby would always be true
And yet, in my heart I knew, dear
That somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me somedayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
