Like the legend of the phoenix, huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning, uh-huh
The force from the beginning
Look

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun

I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don’t believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the Roche
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, oh, I don't wanna sing anymore


"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a–
I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around, it's all I do
When I'm with you

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

Touch, touch
I remember touch
Touch, touch
I remember touch
Where do I belong?
Touch, I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my mind

Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor, it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Home, hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're–


Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're–

Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real
I need something more
I need something more44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance because
I was living in a little town; was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music
At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques
So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s
The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?"
And I didn't have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio

Once you free your mind about a concept of
Harmony and of music being "correct"
You can do whatever you want
So, nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do39EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost, I can't even remember my name

I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
(Where are the locks to try the key?)
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
(And I wonder why)

I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone

Please tell me who I am

Looking for someone

Dream beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes and rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land of love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel eye
Forever watching you and I

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed
There's no such thing as competition
To find our way, we lose control
Remember, love's our only mission
This is a journey of the soul
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
