Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; they don’t know what I’m going through

They don’t understand what I’ve been through
They don’t understand what I go through
You think everything’s all good but you only see what I show you
They don’t understand that boss life, gotta take care of my whole crew
(My whole crew, my whole crew) they depend on me my fuckin niggas
They know the love is real and I’m a fuckin winner
We all gon' eat, Sunday dinner
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
They hate it when you up, they love it when you down
All we got is us then told my niggas look around
Look around, look around
If I gotta be the one to lift us up, I won’t let em down
So at the top it’s just us looking down
Sorry I delayed us, but we gon' get this paper
Had a couple issues, I dealt with them, now it’s payback

Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; they don’t know what I’m going through

It’s like everybody got they hand out
Actin' like they you owe 'em something
They expect you to throw em something
When they really need you to show 'em something
One month, you're broke again
Actin' like you ain’t throw em none
Ungrateful ass niggas, they only love you when you giving
And the day you say you ain’t got it, they forget the days that you did it
You forgot me when I was losin', so forget me when I’m winnin'
Where the dark day was frenzing me 'til the day they be friended me
One day we broke friends, next day we rich enemies
It’s hard being a real nigga, when these niggas got bitch tendencies
Female emotions, I can’t waste my energy
For them I got that remedy, kill 'em with success
Royalty is my pedigree, too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories, god willin I’m blessed
My comeback’s they penalty, these haters gon' be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck 'em they wasn’t really with me all the way - I’ll be okay

Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; don’t know what I’m going through

YEEEAAH~! {*echoes*}
 
I hope my son learn to be not like me
If I die tonight, I hope my daughter never meet a nigga like me
If I die tonight

If I die tonight, just know I lived one hell of a life
Just in case I get killed tonight
I'm writing my will tonight
Give these bum niggas my clothes
Give my niggas my cars, give my mother my dough
Leave my girl my crib, give my brothers my jewels
Give the shooters my guns, they know what to do

Living life too fast to make plans
I'mma trip without my suitcase, shop when I land
Yeah just a life of a real nigga
Basquiat couldn't paint a better picture
50 cent can't pay the bills nigga
So I guess I'm gon' die trying to get richer
Everyday's is a fight, thrilla in manila
And if I die I pray for my killer
Give my mama my dough, she gon' take care of my kids
Give my girl my crib so they have somewhere to live
Give my brothers my jewels, they worth a million or 2
I owe 'em more than that, can't put a price on that
Put my tongue and my dick in a room with all my bitches
And tell 'em that it's going to the higher bidder


Another day another risk
What make it even worse is the shit I got on my wrist
What make it even worse is the kid I got on my whip
Bitches all on my dick, these niggas having a fit
Lit dying for this shit like Mitch, trying to get rich
What up Porter, shit it's a curse and a gift
The good with the bad, gotta take what you get
But if a nigga trying to take what I got
Then he gon' have to take what I give, shots
Another day another blessing, pockets fat, life's Precious
Get it, pockets fat life's Precious
Forever living young, still reckless
Balling every second so if I die tonight
I can truly say my life wasn't perfect but it was worth it


If I die tonight tell 'em I had a ball
Money, bitches and cars, I had 'em all
Give 'em my clothes pack needing bags
Lord knows they need the swag
If I get killed tonight, some niggas gon' smoke a pound for me
Some niggas gon' load up their guns and hit the town for me
These fucking haters gon' smile and breathe
But they bitches gon' frown for me
Fist class to the money got a one way
Fact is we all gotta die someday
So I gotta put my casket on the runway
And tell my kids I'll see 'em again one day

I will, my will, my will, my will

Holding the heat, cold sweat all over my sheet
That's why I paint the most vividest pictures
For my niggas my bitches in the same position I live in
No oil and hot water, just boiling hot water
Cooking coke, to the oil and hot water, shit
But who am I, man?

Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry

Yo, I lived the life of a loner, with a righteous persona
But still sold crack right on the corner
My life consist of, a big puzzle that's mixed up
Big bucks, big drugs, if I get caught, then it's big cuffs
Big bailor gets up, I get out, shit what, this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One that's new and strong, not old and hollow, oh!
As I hold this bottle and smoke this reefer
Listening to some old Aaliyah, I say, damn...
(Damn man, shit is crazy man, woooh!)
And a tear comes trimbling down
Never seen a man cry, well you witness it now
Shit, this isn't game from the heart, this pain from the heart
This for you Dame, it came from the heart, so

Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry

Momma, I just want you to know
I'm in love with you so
If you wasn't here I'd be in love with you soul
My angel, mommy I'd die faithful
Just knowing somone tried to violate you
I'll slide 8ths through the side of their facial
Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
I'd take a slug, eat a bullet, I'd swallow the gun
Shit, you gotta know I'm your son
Damn, this type of love, could only come from a son
Hold up mommy, I'm twisted I'm drunk...listen

C'mon man, listen to me, damn
(Damn!) I'm talking to you
Once again man, once again, I love you

Yeah, but it's more than the liquor and weed
Yeah it's more than the liquor in me
Shit, I gotta get it together
I was falling off, with drunk words and sober thoughts
So, I'm still speaking the truth
And what I'm still speaking is truth
This is your youngest son speaking to you, mommy

Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
