Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; they don’t know what I’m going through

They don’t understand what I’ve been through
They don’t understand what I go through
You think everything’s all good but you only see what I show you
They don’t understand that boss life, gotta take care of my whole crew
(My whole crew, my whole crew) they depend on me my fuckin niggas
They know the love is real and I’m a fuckin winner
We all gon' eat, Sunday dinner
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
They hate it when you up, they love it when you down
All we got is us then told my niggas look around
Look around, look around
If I gotta be the one to lift us up, I won’t let em down
So at the top it’s just us looking down
Sorry I delayed us, but we gon' get this paper
Had a couple issues, I dealt with them, now it’s payback
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; they don’t know what I’m going through

It’s like everybody got they hand out
Actin' like they you owe 'em something
They expect you to throw em something
When they really need you to show 'em something
One month, you're broke again
Actin' like you ain’t throw em none
Ungrateful ass niggas, they only love you when you giving
And the day you say you ain’t got it, they forget the days that you did it
You forgot me when I was losin', so forget me when I’m winnin'
Where the dark day was frenzing me 'til the day they be friended me
One day we broke friends, next day we rich enemies
It’s hard being a real nigga, when these niggas got bitch tendencies
Female emotions, I can’t waste my energy
For them I got that remedy, kill 'em with success
Royalty is my pedigree, too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories, god willin I’m blessed
My comeback’s they penalty, these haters gon' be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck 'em they wasn’t really with me all the way - I’ll be okay
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; don’t know what I’m going through2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And everyday I'm in the hood
And everyday I'm smoking good

I hope my son learn to be not like me
If I die tonight, I hope my daughter never meet a nigga like me
If I die tonight

If I die tonight, just know I lived one hell of a life
Just in case I get killed tonight
I'm writing my will tonight
Give these bum niggas my clothes
Give my niggas my cars, give my mother my dough
Leave my girl my crib, give my brothers my jewels
Give the shooters my guns, they know what to do

Living life too fast to make plans
I'mma trip without my suitcase, shop when I land
Yeah just a life of a real nigga
Basquiat couldn't paint a better picture
50 cent can't pay the bills nigga
So I guess I'm gon' die trying to get richer
Everyday's is a fight, thrilla in manila
And if I die I pray for my killer
Give my mama my dough, she gon' take care of my kids
Give my girl my crib so they have somewhere to live
Give my brothers my jewels, they worth a million or 2
I owe 'em more than that, can't put a price on that
Put my tongue and my dick in a room with all my bitches
And tell 'em that it's going to the higher bidder

Another day another risk
What make it even worse is the shit I got on my wrist
What make it even worse is the kid I got on my whip
Bitches all on my dick, these niggas having a fit
Lit dying for this shit like Mitch, trying to get rich
What up Porter, shit it's a curse and a gift
The good with the bad, gotta take what you get
But if a nigga trying to take what I got
Then he gon' have to take what I give, shots
Another day another blessing, pockets fat, life's Precious
Get it, pockets fat life's Precious
Forever living young, still reckless
Balling every second so if I die tonight
I can truly say my life wasn't perfect but it was worth it


If I die tonight tell 'em I had a ball
Money, bitches and cars, I had 'em all
Give 'em my clothes pack needing bags
Lord knows they need the swag
If I get killed tonight, some niggas gon' smoke a pound for me
Some niggas gon' load up their guns and hit the town for me
These fucking haters gon' smile and breathe
But they bitches gon' frown for me
Fist class to the money got a one way
Fact is we all gotta die someday
So I gotta put my casket on the runway
And tell my kids I'll see 'em again one day
I will, my will, my will, my willEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shoot and move from where ever my targets land
Damn, shit, I see ghosts when I sleep
It's really, I got to wake up, just to know I was sleep
Holding the heat, cold sweat all over my sheet
That's why I paint the most vividest pictures
For my niggas my bitches in the same position I live in
No oil and hot water, just boiling hot water
Cooking coke, to the oil and hot water, shit
But who am I, man?
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry

Yo, I lived the life of a loner, with a righteous persona
But still sold crack right on the corner
My life consist of, a big puzzle that's mixed up
Big bucks, big drugs, if I get caught, then it's big cuffs
Big bailor gets up, I get out, shit what, this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One that's new and strong, not old and hollow, oh!
As I hold this bottle and smoke this reefer
Listening to some old Aaliyah, I say, damn...
(Damn man, shit is crazy man, woooh!)
And a tear comes trimbling down
Never seen a man cry, well you witness it now
Shit, this isn't game from the heart, this pain from the heart
This for you Dame, it came from the heart, so

Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Momma, I just want you to know
I'm in love with you so
If you wasn't here I'd be in love with you soul
My angel, mommy I'd die faithful
Just knowing somone tried to violate you
I'll slide 8ths through the side of their facial
Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
I'd take a slug, eat a bullet, I'd swallow the gun
Shit, you gotta know I'm your son
Damn, this type of love, could only come from a son
Hold up mommy, I'm twisted I'm drunk...listen

C'mon man, listen to me, damn
(Damn!) I'm talking to you
Once again man, once again, I love you

Yeah, but it's more than the liquor and weed
Yeah it's more than the liquor in me
Shit, I gotta get it together
I was falling off, with drunk words and sober thoughts
So, I'm still speaking the truth
And what I'm still speaking is truth
This is your youngest son speaking to you, mommy
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I? Who am I?
That think a man should never never never cry2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you drop, get up and try it again
We tired of being runners up, we coming up
We ready for whatever you put in front of us
Blood, sweat and tears, yeah
We dripped all three just to get here
No longer will I wake up and my dreams just vanish
It's staring right at me, I must take advantage
Hard work pays off, you get what you put in
So why stop now? Gotta keep pushing
We in the fight 'til the finish, so why not fight 'til you're finished?
Dig it, I'm my own author, here's my story
My life's been full of pain, now where's my glory? (Ay!)

So glorious, victorious
We take what we want, we born warriors (Ay!)

So that means, I have to beat him if I have to
Keep him out of bad schools

No screws loose, no loose screws
Got manners, got morals, god sense respect

Fuck a platinum plaque
This is history in the making believe in it
Without you I can't make or succeed in shit
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit
You the reason that I'm breathin
And I'll stop at any moment to see this child live a better life
Wow it's a better life but you better throw down if you ever fight
Like rocky do
Don't be no punk when it's time to get up and put on you boxin shoes
You lace 'em up tight, you fall get up and fight
You lose, o well, we all lose some fights
Jus be a man about yours, life is all about handlin yours, so you just keep

Nah
Yeah le-leave the hissin in there, d-don't take the hissin out
We gonna keep this one all the way gangsta
I mean, you motherfuckers don't realize
How real this shit is man
I mean, people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect what's yours, protect your family
Protect what's right (You hear me)
This story starts off
Little boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto, so he adapts to the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He takes no days off for gettin his cocaine off (off)
He ran back and fourth so much it pissed Jose off (Psssss)
Now Jose was the cocaine boss (boss)
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft (soft)
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off cuz he had love for his sister (Take that, Take that)
And shorty had no love for his sister
Cuz his sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for 'em both
Plus he was good at handlin coke, so Jose liked him
Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street (Who?)
You know, TJ, Big Boo and Malik (Word)
Malik is a killer, Boo is a killer (Yep)
TJ, well he's just another nigga
But, despite the fact (what), they didn't like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that, he was a pitcher here in the winter air (What happened)
They set it up to get him there and hit him there (Damn)
But shorty was smart
So before they got to, load and spark
He said, hold up, my heart (Hold up hold up) Please
Then he said, please, look up in my bag (Look)
There's cook up in my bag, it's all good up in my bag (Here)
And there's more where that came from
I get it from Jose, believe me, there's more where that came from
Yeah, he had 'em lost and the game won (won)
They let him go, yeah, thinkin he would let 'em know (What)
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that (Bout that)
And we all know Jose bout that (Bout that)
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back (What)
In the chair, like "There's no way out that" (Nope)
He said "Shoot em, I'mma blow they house back" (Back)
Next day he sent the two way out town (And..)
And somebody blew they house down (Damn)
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side (Word?)
So shorty called Jose, like "Listen (Listen)
It's going down I need more cocaine" (Bring it)
So we met up (Met up), it was a set up
Guess who, TJ, Malik, and Boo sped up (Wow)
You should've seen the look on Jose's face
You never seen the look on old man's face (Nope)
Told him no man's great
And it's no man's place, to fuck wit no man's fam
Then he said "Where's my sister 'fore I kill you"
The End
The story's over man (It's over man)
They all kinda end like that sometime too (Ya dig)
Ya see, I told the story cuz man, I kinda feel like
Every hood, everybody
Everybody got a Lil Boy Fresh around them somewhere
Whether it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
Huh, I mean ya see
Ya see we all see the same shit, Just through
Different eyes
You surprised? Don't be man
It's just real shit
Holla at cha'boy
DipSet
Ay!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
