If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
But I am about to go
And then you'll know
For me to stay here I got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person....that you really are now
Got to get in straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman taking up my time
Whoa, oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun (HOW HOW)
When you know that you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one
Ohh oww oohh
I'll be good
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now

And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person....that you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now
 
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

Ooh, sha sha
I am everyday people
 
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair

One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn

Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Blood's thicker than the mud

It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Over there, over there

Newlywed a year ago
But you're still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh-huh

You can't leave cause your heart is there
But, sure, you can't stay cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway cause you're all broke down

It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Oh, hey, a family affair
It's a family affair
 
Lookin' at the devil
Grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin'
I begin to run
Bullets start chasin'
I begin to stop
We begin to wrastle
I was on the top
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Stiff all in the collar
Fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin'
Stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party
But I could never stay
Many thangs on my mind
Words in the way
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Dance to the music
All nite long
Everyday people
Sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama start to cry
Papa still singin'
You can make it if you try
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
(Different strokes for different folks, yeah)
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Flamin' eyes of people fear
Burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much
Hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Dig it for a starter, now
Dyin' young is hard to take
Sellin' out is harder
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
 
Stand
In the end you'll still be you
One that's done all the things you set out to do
Stand
There's a cross for you to bear
Things to go through if you're going anywhere
Stand
For the things you know are right
It s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight
Stand
All the things you want are real
You have you to complete and there is no deal

Stand, stand, stand
Stand, stand, stand

Stand
You've been sitting much too long
There's a permanent crease in your right and wrong
Stand
There's a midget standing tall
And the giant beside him about to fall


Stand
They will try to make you crawl
And they know what you're saying makes sense and all
Stand
Don't you know that you are free
Well at least in your mind if you want to be

Everybody
Stand, stand, stand
 
Get up and dance to the music
Get on up and dance to the music

Hey Greg

What?

All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat, yeah


I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet


I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide


You might like to hear my organ
I said ‘Ride, Sally, ride’


Cynthia, Jerry
If I could hear the horns blowin'
Cynthia on the throne, yeah


Listen to me
Cynthia & Jerry got a message they're sayin':

All the squares, go home

Aaaaah, yeah

Everybody is a star
Who would rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Who'll come out on a cloudy day
'Til the sun that loves you proud
When the system tries to bring you down
Ever had to shine tonight
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right
Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel you need to be
Ever catch a falling star?
Ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle goin' round and round
Shine, shine, shine, shine
 
Just like a baby
Sometimes I cry
Just like a baby
I can feel it when you lie to me
Just like a baby
Everything is new
Just like a baby
Come to find out
I'm a whole lot like you, too
Just like a baby
See the babies growin'
Just like a baby
