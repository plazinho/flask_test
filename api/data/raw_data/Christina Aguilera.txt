Little girls, listen closely
'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world, you are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no

Show some skin, make him want you
'Cause God forbid you
Know your own way home
Ask yourself why it matters
Who it flatters
You're more than flesh and bones

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change (no)
But I got a mind to show my strength (my strength)
And I got a right to speak my mind (my mind)
And I'm gonna pay for this (pay, pay)
They're gonna burn me at the stake (stake)
But I got a fire in my veins (veins)
I wasn't made to fall in line (line)
No, no, I wasn't made to fall in line
No, we weren't made to fall in line, oh

Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength (my strength)
And I got a right to speak my mind (my mind)
And I'm gonna pay for this (I'm gonna pay for this)
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
'Cause I wasn't made to fall in line
But I got a fire in my veins
I'm never gonna fall in line, oh

Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
 
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ah

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you lookin' down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
Oh, oh

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you
 
Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune, yeah
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
The sun will always, always shine
(And tomorrow, we might wake on the other side)

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh
Ooh, don't you bring me down
Ooh, today
 
(Come on, come on, uh, yeah)
Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh (But my heart is sayin', "No, no")

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way (Yeah)
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's bangin' and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (Yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh, ooh (Mm, but my heart is sayin' no, but my heart is sayin', "No, no")

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game, aha
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

You thought I would forget but I, I remembered (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I remembered
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remembered (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh)
I remembered

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
 
Sweet love, sweet love, trapped in your love
I've opened up, unsure I can trust
My heart and I, we're buried in dust
Free me, free us

You're all I need, when I'm holding you tight
If you walk away, I will suffer tonight

I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you

So much, so young, I faced on my own
Walls I built up, became my home
I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us
Sweet love, so pure

I catch my breath, we're just one beating heart
And I brace myself
Please, don't tear this apart

I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you, I am bound to-

Suddenly the moment's here
I embrace my fears
All that I have been carrying all these years
Do I risk it all?
Come this far just to fall, fall, oh-oh-oh

I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
And finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am, oh, I am
I'm bound to you
 
Sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of this life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice, won't think twice

Are you devil? Are you angel?
Am I heaven? Am I hell?
I can barely find the proof to save myself
Are you water? Are you fire?
Are you filthy? Are you pure?
Oh, I thought by now I'd know
But I'm not sure

Well, you're no angel
I never asked you to be
You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need
But it still hurts me

Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice
Won't think twice

My forever and my end
My forgiveness and my sin
I have sacrificed the most of my youth
Is it treason? Is it true?
That the worst I won't undo
Only enemy I have in love is you

Well, you're no angel
I never asked you to be
You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need
But it still hurts me

Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
Oh, I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice, no
Won't think twice

Were you devil? Were you angel?
It's too late to change my mind
I would do it all again and not think twice
 
Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down

She comes through the club looking for a good time

Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar, Candyman
Hey, hey yeah, uh

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night

A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Ooh yeah, yeah-eah

He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (oh!)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Oh whoa, yeah, yeah

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane (oh!)
Good things come for boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine

Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell

Squared herself away as she let out a yell

Look at me
You may think you see who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask, I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world what's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else
For all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be free, to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?

I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
