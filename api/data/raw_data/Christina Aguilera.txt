Little girls, listen closely
'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world, you are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no

Show some skin, make him want you
'Cause God forbid you
Know your own way home
Ask yourself why it matters
Who it flatters
You're more than flesh and bones

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change (no)
But I got a mind to show my strength (my strength)
And I got a right to speak my mind (my mind)
And I'm gonna pay for this (pay, pay)
They're gonna burn me at the stake (stake)
But I got a fire in my veins (veins)
I wasn't made to fall in line (line)
No, no, I wasn't made to fall in line
No, we weren't made to fall in line, oh

Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?

It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength (my strength)
And I got a right to speak my mind (my mind)
And I'm gonna pay for this (I'm gonna pay for this)
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
'Cause I wasn't made to fall in line
But I got a fire in my veins
I'm never gonna fall in line, oh

Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
 
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh, ooh

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ah

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you lookin' down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back

Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
Oh, oh

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you
 
Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune, yeah
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
The sun will always, always shine
(And tomorrow, we might wake on the other side)

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh
Ooh, don't you bring me down
Ooh, today
 
(Come on, come on, uh, yeah)
Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh (But my heart is sayin', "No, no")

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way (Yeah)
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's bangin' and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (Yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

Oh (My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh, ooh (Mm, but my heart is sayin' no, but my heart is sayin', "No, no")

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game, aha
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

You thought I would forget but I, I remembered (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I remembered
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remembered (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh)
I remembered

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
 
Sweet love, sweet love, trapped in your love
I've opened up, unsure I can trust
My heart and I, we're buried in dust
Free me, free us

You're all I need, when I'm holding you tight
If you walk away, I will suffer tonight

I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you

So much, so young, I faced on my own
Walls I built up, became my home
I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us
Sweet love, so pure

I catch my breath, we're just one beating heart
And I brace myself
Please, don't tear this apart

I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you, I am bound to-

Suddenly the moment's here
I embrace my fears
All that I have been carrying all these years
Do I risk it all?
Come this far just to fall, fall, oh-oh-oh

I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
And finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am, oh, I am
I'm bound to you
 
Sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of this life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice, won't think twice

Are you devil? Are you angel?
Am I heaven? Am I hell?
I can barely find the proof to save myself
Are you water? Are you fire?
Are you filthy? Are you pure?
Oh, I thought by now I'd know
But I'm not sure

Well, you're no angel
I never asked you to be
You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need
But it still hurts me

Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice
Won't think twice

My forever and my end
My forgiveness and my sin
I have sacrificed the most of my youth
Is it treason? Is it true?
That the worst I won't undo
Only enemy I have in love is you

Well, you're no angel
I never asked you to be
You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need
But it still hurts me

Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life
I found the price of love and lost my mind
Oh, I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
I'd do it all again and won't think twice, no
Won't think twice

Were you devil? Were you angel?
It's too late to change my mind
I would do it all again and not think twice
 
Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down

She comes through the club looking for a good time

Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar, Candyman
Hey, hey yeah, uh

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night

A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Ooh yeah, yeah-eah

He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (oh!)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Oh whoa, yeah, yeah

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane (oh!)
Good things come for boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine

Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell

Squared herself away as she let out a yell

Look at me
You may think you see who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask, I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world what's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else
For all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be free, to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?

I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
 
So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will

So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)

Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls!

This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
(Respect your worth, oh)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder! (Shout louder!)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Whoa)
This is for my girls all around the world (All my girls)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Around the world)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Yeah)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

(Uh, oh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Spread the word (Can't hold us down)
Yeah, we here, we back again, yeah
Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera
Yeah (Can't hold us down, uh, uh)
 
Maria hey, hey, Maria
Maria, don't you hear me calling, Maria?
Maria, girl you know you were the only one

How was I supposed to know
That it would cost my soul?
Nothin is free', outchea
I wanna breathe outchea
And how am I supposed to face this lonely life I've created?
Is that the price that I'm payin'?
I wanna feel it

All my life, wouldn't give up
Was too young to know the difference
How did I get so low?
When did I turn so cold
Inside of my own mind, I believe my own lies
I'm facing the mirror

Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just need to see ya, Maria

Now do you hear it in my voice?
That I'm tryna make a choice
I don't know which way to go at this crossroads
You duck taped my mouth shut
Make me feel worthless, used up

So tired of painting all this makeup
'Cause it won't hide my deep cuts
Eyes open, but can't see
Mouth open, but can't speak
I'm facing the mirror

Where, where, where is Maria?
Why, why, why don't I see her?
I, I just wanna see her
Where, where, where is Maria?
Oh, I just wanna see ya, Maria

Oh, my lord (oh)
Can you take away this heavy load? (oh)
I can't carry it anymore (oh)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?
Oh, my lord (oh, my lord)
Can you take away this heavy load? (Can you take away this heavy load?)
I can't carry it anymore (I can't)
I'm callin' an angel, where is my saviour?

Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
Hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me
You keep on running away

Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya
Can you hear me callin'?
My whole world is fallin'
I can't see ya, oh, I need ya
Don't keep on runnin' away (you keep on runnin' away)
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Don't you keep on runnin' from me
Where, where, where is Maria?

Don't run away, don't run away, no
Don't run away, don't run away, no
Where is Maria?
You know I need ya
Where is Maria?
 
The dress is Chanel, the shoes YSL
The bag is Dior, Agent Provocateaur
My address today, L.A. by the way
Above Sunset Strip, the Hills all the way
My rings are by Webster, they make their heads twirl
They all say, "Darling, what did you do for those pearls?"
What? I am a good girl

B.H. I adore, Rodeo L'amore
Breakfast Polo Lounge, and poolside for sure
The Chateau for cocktails, the Courtyard at nine
Dan Tana's for dinner, the Helen's divine
You know I have found, the word’s gone around
They all say my feet never do touch the ground
What? I am a good girl

I am a good girl
Uhh, ooh, uhh, yeah, uhh
 
Never wanted to feel weak in love, give up control
Never wanted to let down my guard, be vulnerable
Never wanted to feel helpless or too comfortable
I’ll make it on my own, hey
I've been thinking a lot about the way that people change
The most beautiful beginnings can go down in flames
It's inevitable, and that's what's got me so afraid
I'd rather be alone

I don't want no white picket fence
Dozen roses and a wedding dress
Fairy tales or fake happiness
But here we are and I must confess

Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused
I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

You came into my life when I wasn't trying to find
Anybody to love, hiding what I felt inside
But you opened me up and now I finally realize
I'll be your girl for life

We don't need a big audience
Thousand people we never met
Me and you and a couple of friends
And here we are and I must confess

Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused
I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you
And oh, I know that it's scary
But I know that it's true, I'm saying "I do"
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

Beating heart and trembling hands
Take me just the way I am
'Cause all that I want is one and the same
For the rest of my days, for the rest of my days
You can ask me in a hundred years
If I would still be standing here
When we're old and gray, I'd answer the same
Our love will remain, oh, our love will remain

Yeah, I was over my head feeling confused
Been losing my mind, don't know what to do
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you
And oh, I know that it's scary
(But I know that it's true, I'm saying "I do")
'Cause I don't want to get married
Unless it's with you, unless it's with you
Unless it's with you
 
Oh, oh yeah

Got me sendin' for you all across town, cross town, cross town
I wanna celebrate you right now, right now, right now, hey

Walked in, no list, fuck a co-sign

Wanna show you how much I missed ya
My schedule flexible so I switched up
Permanent vacation, we should go away
Way too much for me to wanna throw away
I'm hopin' that you're racin' through the signs

Ain't no other man who can talk to you like I did, that's real
Let's start a family, I'm Uncle Phil, you my Aunt Viv
Fly to Spain, go to Rome
We don't ever have to ever go home
I wanna love you from your head to your toe
I like a little fuss and fighting when I go
You say leave, tell me stay, want me go
Then I leave, pump fake like I'm gone
But you know I never leave you on your own
And you're too bad for these brothers who be on your phone like

Let me make this simple for ya
Lay it out on the table for ya
In case you need a little reminder
I've been doing this way before you
Boy, you already know my story
You were raised in all my glory

I don't need your little money
I can put you under something
Stop talking, we can get along
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on
Where you want to be, I've been before
Shh, say no more
Boy, you're so much better when you don't speak
If you get somethin',  get one thing
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league

No, baby, you can't do it quite like I do

Like I do
I may not want, but just might have to show you
Show you
What I do
And you can't do it quite like I do

This feeling is legendary
Welcome to my sanctuary
Every time like the first time
But, baby, girls like me ain't temporary
Can't fake it when it comes this natural
I ain't ever tried, it's just natural, ha

I don't need your little money
I can put you under something
Stop talking, we can get along
We can Marvin Gaye and get it on
Where you wanna be, I've been before

If you get somethin' get one thing
Can't play me, boy, I'm out of your league

Oooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wooo
 
I am done, smoking gun
We've lost it all, the love is gone
She has won, now it's no fun
We've lost it all, the love is gone

And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

I feel like our world's been infected (Ahh)
And somehow, you left me neglected (Ooo)
We've found our lives been changed (Ooo)
Babe, you lost me

And we tried, oh, how we cried
We lost ourselves, the love has died
And though we tried, you can't deny
We're left as shells, we lost the fight

And we had magic (Ooo)
And this is tragic (Ooo)
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself, woah

Woah, I feel like our world's been infected (Ooo)
And somehow you left me neglected (Ooo)
We've found our lives been changed (Ooo)
Babe, you lost me

Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet (Ahh, ahh)
But you chose lust when you deceived me (Ahh, ahh)
And you'll regret it, but it's too late (Ahh, ahh)
How can I ever trust you again? (Ahh)

I feel like our world's been infected (Ooo)
And somehow you left me neglected (Ooo)
We've found our lives been changed
Babe, you lost me
 
War is not freedom
Over my shoulder
I see a clearer view
All for my family
Reason I'm breathing
Everything to lose

Should I ask myself in the water
What a warrior would do?
Tell me underneath my armor
Am I loyal, brave and true?
Am I loyal, brave and true?

Losing is easy
Winning takes bravery
I am a tiger’s fool
Out in the open
No one to save me
The kindest of whispers are cruel

Should I ask myself in the water
What a warrior would do?
Tell me underneath my armor
Am I loyal, brave and true?
Am I loyal, brave and true?

Cold is the morning
Warm is the dream
Chasing the answers
'Til I can't sleep
Will I be stronger
Or will I be weak
When you’re not with me?

Who am I without my armor
Standing in my father's shoes?
All I know is that it's harder
To be loyal, brave and true
