I know you, I know you
I know you, I know you
I know you, I know you

This gonna be a heavy night
Way too many drinks, ain't even started
Never need to apologize
We already know we're far from perfect
I fall to the curb
You laugh 'til it hurts
Who cares we've been here so many times

But we're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds

I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
Stumbling
I can barely see in front of me
Strangers start to look like friendly faces
In the middle, I'm steady on my feet (you, you, you, you)
And carrying the world is overrated
I fall to the curb
You laugh 'til it hurts
Who cares we've been here so many times

But we're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds

I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
Stumbling

We're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds
I know you
I know you

I know you, I know you

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

But now I truly realize
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well, I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies
And, well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away
Well, I'm so tired, baby
Things you say, you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room, baby
Don't listen to the games they play

Girl, I thought you'd realize
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise, babe
And well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh I'm walking away, from the troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (I'm walking away)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, I try to show you baby)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh I'm gon', I'm gonna find a better day)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh yeah, from the troubles in my life, baby)

I got something to say, something to say
Alright (Can you feel me?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, "Hey boy, come on right around"
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, "Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "Hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, "Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door"
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby

"Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You know what?
Got something to say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out, yeah

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, "Love to rendezvous"
She asked me, "What we were gonna do?"
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh-oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (Oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writing is on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before may go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writing is on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall
I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews, no pictures
Endless demands
Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart?

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writing is on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

Now I know I made mistakes
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Six o'clock in the morning
Wipe the sleep from my eyes
Felt just like an ordinary day
Just around the corner, such a surprise
A beautiful angel materialized
Time stood still face to face
I'm sure we'd met in another time and place
Our eyes met as you passed me by (passed me by)
Two souls entwined in the blink of an eye, yeah
And I had to figure out what I'd be missing
So I turned to you and asked you if you wanted to
(You know we'll be getting some)
(Getting jiggy just for fun)
Rendezvous where to, my place say two

Tonight'll be your night

I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you
And all the things you do
Girl, feels so right
And all I know is you're the one for me
That special kind of lady
In my life, in my life

Well, here I am writing you a love song
Holding back those years

For all the years that I've known you baby
I can't figure out the reason why lately
You've been acting so cold (didn't you say)
If there's a problem we should work it out
So why you giving me the cold shoulder now?
Like you don't want to talk to me girl (tell me)
Okay I know I was late again (late again)
I made you mad and dinners thrown in (the bin)
But why you making this thing drag on so long? (I wanna know)
I'm sick and tired of this silly game (silly game)
Don't think that I'm the only one here to blame
It's not me who's been going round slamming doors

That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more

Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, you're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears, I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

I know that I've made a few mistakes
But never thought things would turn out this way
Doesn't make sense to me now that you're gone (I see it all so clearly)
Me at the door with you in a state (in a state)
Giving my reasons but as you look away
I can see a tear roll down your face

That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more


Those simple words hit so hard
They turned my whole world upside down
Girl you caught me completely off guard
On that night you said to me
I just don't love you no more

One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time

I got liquor in my system
Feeling kinda wavy, got me thinkin'
Of all the things we used to do
Back then when I was still with you
You were there for me from the start
When I didn't ever pain and steal with your heart
For me those feelings haven't changed
Need you back in my arms again

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shave
What can I say?
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waiting and reminiscing
One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

I wanna hold you, but it's from a distance
I don't know what to do, needed some assistance
I roll up to your mum's house, I don't even business
Cause I do anything, cause maybe she can help me fix this
So many mandem on your case, really shoudn't allowed it
I was nobody and you picked me out of the crowed
It took me this long just for me to figure it out
But the simple fact is I'm lost girl when you ain't around

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days

Never thought that I'd fall in love (x4)
But it grew from a simple crush (x4)
Being without you girl, I was all messed up (x4)
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough (x4)

Been a fool, girl I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back i wish i could rewind

Because i can't sleep til you're next to me
No I can't live without you no more
Oh I stay up till you're next to me
Til this house feels like it did before
Feels like insomnia ah ah (x4)

Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love (x4)
You used to think I'd never find a girl I could trust (x4)
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us (x4)
But now I'm sitting here thinking I messed the whole thing up (x4)

Been a fool, girl I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back i wish i could rewind
Because i can't sleep til you're next to me
No I can't live without you no more
Oh I stay up till you're next to me
Til this house feels like it did before
Feels like insomnia ah ah (x4)

I just can't go to sleep
Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And i know that it's love because

I can't sleep til you're next to me
No i can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh i stay up til you're next to me (to me)
Til this house feels like it did before
Feels like insomnia ah ah (x8)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Break it down, break it down, let me break it down
Break it down)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, "hey boy, come on right around"
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Say, parents tryna find out what we were up to
Oh yeah

Saying, fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Spit a sixteen, a quick sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
Spit a sixteen, a quick sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
Seems like I'm living a dream
Nineteen ninety nine when I first came on the scene
Skinny young breh from out Southampton
With a bunch of melodies for days, know what I mean?
Lean and mean, embodied the whole scene
Packin' on muscle like bars of protein
Crushin' every microphone that I be holdin'
'Cause you know I've been trainin' 

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Saying, fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping oh yeah, oh yeah
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night
Can you fill me in
Why were you creeping round
Why were you creeping round late last night

Its best at sixteen, it's sick with sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
Its best at sixteen, it's sick with sixteen
I been doing doing this since I was sixteen
Been a few years, let's call it sixteen
A brand new flow for two thousand sixteen
 so let me run up on this beat
No nonsense whenever you're 'round me
It don't make sense, my time ain't wasted
 we know that's a long ting
But then I sing, I flip the whole ting
One verse sung, one verse I be rappin'
I never get bored to a beat that's thumpin'
 press stop and start beatboxin'2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Always said I would know where to find love
Always thought I'd be ready and strong enough
But some times I just felt I could give up
But you came and you changed my whole world now
I'm somewhere I've never been before
Now I see what love means
It's so unbelievable
And I don't want to let it go
Something so beautiful
Flowing down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be
In my heart in my head it's so clear now
Hold my hand you've got nothing to fear now
I was lost and you've rescued me somehow
I'm alive, I'm in love you complete me
And I've never been here before
Now I see what love means
It's so unbelievable
And I don't want to let it go
Something so beautiful
Flowing down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be
When I think of what I have and this chance I nearly lost
I can't help but break down and cry
Ohh yeah, break down and cry
It's so unbelievable
And I don't want to let it go
Something so beautiful
Flowing down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be
Now I see what love means1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
One, two, buckle my shoe
Three, four, step inside the venue and
See, in the corner of my eye

She was like a beauty queen out of a magazine, looked about 19
Five minutes talking, next thing it's her number being written

Kissing and cuddling at my crib after the venue and I
Didn't wanna take it too fast so I said:
"Slow slow, I gotta make some calls so keep it down low"
She was like: "I can't believe you wanna talk instead of making love to me"
Five minutes chilling, next thing it's my name she's calling

You say it's over, that you're leaving
Get out of my way
I'm blocking the door, what I say
I don't care if you stay, care if you stay
Seems like no matter what I do
The message just ain't getting through
Just when I think we've hit a wall
You look at me and say, at me and say

Baby, I'm sorry, I swear I didn't mean it
Mean it that way
Baby, don't worry cause love ain't easy
But at the end of the day

Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
The world could stop
And everything could all fall down
But I will never give you up
Because nothing will ever change my love for you
Nothing, nothing
Out with my boys, yeah we been drinking
Now you're calling me, why you calling me?
You asking where are you, it's late
It's quarter to three, are you kidding me?
Why can't you just chill out, be cool?
When you know I'm coming home to you
Just when I think you're 'bout to hang up
Girl, that's when you say, that's when you say

Baby, I'm sorry, I swear I didn't mean it
Mean it that way
Baby, don't worry cause love ain't easy
But at the end of the day

Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
The world could stop
And everything could all fall down
But I will never give you up
Because nothing will ever change my love for you
We were built to last
Built to surpass space and time
To let go would be a crime
How am I supposed to survive
Without you in my life?
Oh, you should know that

Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
Even if the odds are up
Even if the words run out
Even if the times get tough
I know nothing will ever change my love for you
The world could stop
And everything could all fall down
But I will never give you up
Because nothing will ever change my love for you
Nothing will ever change my love for you
I know nothing will ever change my love, oh no, yeah
Nothing will change my, nothing will ever change my
Nothing will ever change my love for you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Into the year 2 0 straight from 9 9

One day minding my own business
Girl from the back won't keep her distance
She was all over me
Just won't let it be
So i said to her i got a girl at home
This is so hard for me, but you got to leave me alone
She said she didn't want to listen to me
Knew exactly what she wanted to be
My baby
I must admit that she was getting to me
Waiting for me
Wanting me to hold her oh so tightly
Together, forever, wherever, whatever
She said she couldn't find nobody better
Wasn't gonna give up on me never
She said
"Ooh you're looking so fly
Every time you pass me by
I like the way you move your body"
Girl I must admit
You're looking real fit
Let's chill for a little bit
I know you wanna get with me
Girl you know I'm not free

It seems like everyday girl you wanna be calling me
And when I step outside you always follow me
You said that you were really feeling Sisqo's song
About the thong th-thong thong thong did I wanna see
And when you talk like that you know you're really tempting me
But I got a girl at home who'll do the same for me
And that's the way it's gotta be, gotta be
So listen now lady
Ooh I like your profile
The way you talk and your smile
But you gotta understand lady
I'm not cheating on my baby
Ooh you know this ain't right
I'm going home to my girl tonight
And I'm sorry that we couldn't get it on
But the love for my girl's too strong

Girlfriend this love we got be golden
And you know you got me open

Girl, it would be you I'd be calling
Since I met you my phone bill be doubling
But girlfriend you know that money ain't a thing
With who me
The one and only c-r-a-i-g come one
Now let me deliver this properly
So the world can see that I
Ain't the type of guy
And why should I, make my girlfriend cry
Can't deny the girl I met was real fly
But it's you that puts me on a natural high
So I, just walked on by
Saying my oh my

I wish that I was staying longer
But I've been called into the light
Something 'bout you makes me stronger
But all the lows, they feel like highs
I'm sorry that I never told you
But I will never lose the faith
Through the stars, over the oceans
I'll meet you there someday

So lay me down, in the water
Let me drown, don't let my feet touch the ground
Kiss me now, until it's over
We're running out of time

When I'm with you, I can hear them singing
My tears will fall when my eyes close
With you, I am always winning
And that feeling never goes

So lay me down, in the water
Let me drown, don't let my feet touch the ground
Kiss me now, until it's over
We're running out of time
I wish we could rewrite our story, love is extraordinary
Try to say the words but make no sound
If God is real, then reassure me
Take my hand and hold me closely
Show me that you'll always be around
If my heart is never found
Love is all we needed
But time let us down (Time let us down)
I can feel you getting lighter
Your eyes are shining brighter
You're finally coming home
Don't have to wait no longer
I know I made you stronger
I know you're not alone

So lay me down, in the water
Let me drown, don't let my feet touch the ground
When we're found
Love was all we needed
But time let us down
When we're found
Love was all we needed
But time let us down1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
