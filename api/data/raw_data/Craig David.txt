I know you, I know you
I know you, I know you
I know you, I know you

This gonna be a heavy night
Way too many drinks, ain't even started
Never need to apologize
We already know we're far from perfect
I fall to the curb
You laugh 'til it hurts
Who cares we've been here so many times

But we're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds

I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
Stumbling
I can barely see in front of me
Strangers start to look like friendly faces
In the middle, I'm steady on my feet (you, you, you, you)
And carrying the world is overrated
I fall to the curb
You laugh 'til it hurts
Who cares we've been here so many times

But we're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds

I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you
Stumbling

We're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And there's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other
I know you, know me too
We're all stumbling through the night
But it's paradise in our minds
I know you
I know you
Stumbling, I know you
I know you, I know you

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

But now I truly realize
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well, I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies
And, well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away
Well, I'm so tired, baby
Things you say, you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room, baby
Don't listen to the games they play

Girl, I thought you'd realize
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise, babe
And well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh I'm walking away, from the troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (I'm walking away)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, I try to show you baby)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh I'm gon', I'm gonna find a better day)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh yeah, from the troubles in my life, baby)

I got something to say, something to say
Alright (Can you feel me?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, "Hey boy, come on right around"
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, "Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, "Hey girl, come on right around"
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, "Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door"
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby

"Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You know what?
Got something to say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out, yeah

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, "Love to rendezvous"
She asked me, "What we were gonna do?"
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh-oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (Oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writing is on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before may go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writing is on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall
I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews, no pictures
Endless demands
Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart?

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writing is on the wall
Superstar you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

Now I know I made mistakes
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Six o'clock in the morning
Wipe the sleep from my eyes
Felt just like an ordinary day
Just around the corner, such a surprise
A beautiful angel materialized
Time stood still face to face
I'm sure we'd met in another time and place
Our eyes met as you passed me by (passed me by)
Two souls entwined in the blink of an eye, yeah
And I had to figure out what I'd be missing
So I turned to you and asked you if you wanted to
(You know we'll be getting some)
(Getting jiggy just for fun)
Rendezvous where to, my place say two
And we can do anything you wanna do
Hey, tonight is your night, yeah
When you close your eyes
Take a minute, take a moment, realize
Do you see me when you fantasize?
Tonight'll be your night

I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you
And all the things you do
Girl, feels so right
And all I know is you're the one for me
That special kind of lady
In my life, in my life

Well, here I am writing you a love song
Holding back those years
It's been so long
And I can't deny the way that I'm feeling

For all the years that I've known you baby
I can't figure out the reason why lately
You've been acting so cold (didn't you say)
If there's a problem we should work it out
So why you giving me the cold shoulder now?
Like you don't want to talk to me girl (tell me)
Okay I know I was late again (late again)
I made you mad and dinners thrown in (the bin)
But why you making this thing drag on so long? (I wanna know)
I'm sick and tired of this silly game (silly game)
Don't think that I'm the only one here to blame
It's not me who's been going round slamming doors

That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more

Rain outside my window pouring down
What now, you're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears, I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
I just don't love you no more

I know that I've made a few mistakes
But never thought things would turn out this way
Doesn't make sense to me now that you're gone (I see it all so clearly)
Me at the door with you in a state (in a state)
Giving my reasons but as you look away
I can see a tear roll down your face

That's when you turned and said to me
I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more


Those simple words hit so hard
They turned my whole world upside down
Girl you caught me completely off guard
On that night you said to me
I just don't love you no more

One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time

I got liquor in my system
Feeling kinda wavy, got me thinkin'
Of all the things we used to do
Back then when I was still with you
You were there for me from the start
When I didn't ever pain and steal with your heart
For me those feelings haven't changed
Need you back in my arms again

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shave
What can I say?
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waiting and reminiscing
One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

I wanna hold you, but it's from a distance
I don't know what to do, needed some assistance
I roll up to your mum's house, I don't even business
Cause I do anything, cause maybe she can help me fix this
So many mandem on your case, really shoudn't allowed it
I was nobody and you picked me out of the crowed
It took me this long just for me to figure it out
But the simple fact is I'm lost girl when you ain't around

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shave
What can I say?
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waiting and reminiscing
One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up,  no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

So tell me baby is there hope for you and me?
Cause I just wanna have you back in my arms
Kicking myself, it drives me crazy thinking 'bout you
Counting all the nights and days you've been gone
Oh yeah
One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up, so I'm not giving up no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
