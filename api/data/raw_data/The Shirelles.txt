Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me..2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my mama said
And then she said someone will look at me
Like I'm looking at you one day, then I might find
I don't want it any old way, so I don't worry 'cause
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said

There'll be days like this my mama said

Hey, don't you worry

This is dedicated to the one I love
While I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
Life can never be exactly like we want it to be
I can be satisfied just knowing that you love me
There's one thing I want you to do especially for me
And it's something that everybody needs
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You broke his heart and made him cry
And he's been blue since then
Now he's found somebody new
And you want him back again
Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do
"But I love him"
No you don't, it's just your pride that's hurt!
"I still love him"
If you got him back again, you'd go right out and do him dirt!
Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do
"But I love him"
It's too late to have a change of heart!
"I still love him"
Tomorrow is his wedding day and you'll keep quiet if you're smart!
Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do
Forget him cause he don't belong to you
It's too late he's found somebody new
There's not a single thing that you can doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You say you think I'm beautiful
You say you live for my touch
Tell me the things I want to hear
Don't you know you can never say too much
You gotta keep tellin' me things I want to hear
You gotta say pretty words every time you're near

Tonight you're acting strange, I find
Have you got something on your mind?
Something's wrong, I can see it, see it in your eyes
Oh darling, don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Oh, it may just be all in my mind
But tonight doesn't seem like other times
Then you were laughing and gay but now I hear you sighing
Oh darling, don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Have I lost touch with your heart
Or do I just worry too much?
I couldn't stand for us to part
Because I love you much, much too much
So don't let this kiss be our last kiss
Let there be other nights of holding you like this
Please don't walk away, pretty baby with that look in your eyes
Oh no no, darling, don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Oh baby, don't say goodnight and mean goodbye
Oh oh oh, don't say goodnight and mean goodbyeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Our love's becoming a thing of the past (x2)
Your kisses taste like it's goodbye
My eyes know they're gonna cry
I feel I'm losing you too fast, oh yeah
And our love's becoming a thing of the past
What happened to those happy hours
And where is the sweet bouquet of flowers
I'm so afraid the die is cast, oh yeah
And our love's becoming a thing of the past
You used to call me your sugar baby
Now I say call me, you tell me maybe
If you don't love me, stop pretending
Who needs a book with a heartbreak ending
This is the moment to decide
Don't be influenced by foolish pride
Let's try to make our little love last, oh yeah
Because our love's becoming a thing of the past
Remember, every other time we love
Our love's becoming a thing of the past
Darlin', tell me I've been dreamin' 'bout it
Our love's becoming a thing of the pastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo) (x2)
Some other guy may give me diamonds & pearls
The kind of things that mean so much to some girls
But in the long run, baby, it's love that really counts
Believe me, it's love that really counts
& baby, after loving you
I'm here to say that no one else will do
Who cares if you don't show me Paris or Rome?
As long as you are here, I'm happy at home
'Cause in the long run, baby, it's love that really counts
Believe me, it's love that really counts
When other loves have come & gone
This love of ours will soon go on & on
So take me in your arms, & darling
Kiss me like only you know how to do
It's love that really counts, love that really counts
I'm tellin' you

Make The Night Just A Little Longer
MAKE THE NIGHT JUST A LITTLE LONGER
The Shirelles
My days are years
'Cause I don't see my baby till the stars are in the sky
& every night
When we can be together, time just seems to hurry by
CHORUS:
So Lord, I'm beggin' you to
Make the night (just a little longer)
Make the night (just a little longer)
So I can kiss him (just a little longer)
& hold him tight (just a little longer)
You made the world the way you thought it should be
So won't you make the night a little longer for me?
My nights are warm
'Cause when he hugs & holds me, everything just feels so fine
But Lord, you know
I hate to see the sunlight, takes away that man of mine
(chorus)
(Just a little longer, just a little longer)
(instrumental)
(chorus)
Then embrace his arms (just a little longer)
& all of his charms (just a little longer)

Everybody loves a lover
I'm a lover, everybody loves me
Anyhow, that's how I feel
Wow, I feel just like a Pollyanna
I should worry, not for nothin'
Everybody loves me, yes they do
And I love everybody
Since I fell in love with you
Who's the most popular personality?
I can't help thinkin' it's no one else but me
Gee, I feel just about ten feet tall, havin' a ball
Guess ya might call me a Pollyanna
Everybody loves a lover
I should worry, not for nothin'
Everybody loves me, yes they do
And I love everybody
Since I fell in love with
Fell in love with
Fell in love with you

There is no place like home
There is no place like home
Do you remember
You left this morning at nine
With everything fine
Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)
Do you remember
(Oh oh oh)
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)
(Well)
Well
(Well)
Well, at ten o'clock I was lonely and blue
At twelve o'clock I thought of nothing but you
From two o'clock till a quarter of four
I waited patiently to hear your footsteps at the door
Do you remember
(Oh oh oh)
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
Welcome home, baby

You say hop and I hop
You say stop and I stop
You say jump and I jump
Anything you say, I'm like a hunk of clay
I'm just like putty, putty in your hands, uh huh, uh huh
With one wave of your hand (putty putty putty putty)
I'm your slave to command (putty putty putty putty)
And I gladly obey (putty putty putty putty)
You say I'm like a hunk of clay
I'm just like putty, putty in your hands, uh huh, uh huh
You come straight a girl I've known before
You cut me down to the size of a rubber ball
You can use me, lose me, but never refuse me
Without your love I ain't nothin' at all, wo oh
They say I'm a fool (putty putty putty putty)
'Cause you treat me so cruel (putty putty putty putty)
But I'll go on this way (putty putty putty putty)
Without you, babe, I'm like a hunk of clay
You come straight a girl I've known before
You cut me down to the size of a rubber ball
You can use me, lose me, but never refuse me

When a boy meets a girl
That he wants to get to know
He just walks right up to her
Introduces himself
Then he tells her so

But what does a girl do
When she meets a boy
Who makes her feel
The same way too
Somebody tell me
Tell me, tell me
What does a girl do?
(What does a girl do?)
And when a boy meets a girl
For the very first time
It's not wrong for him to say
"Darling, I want you to be mine"

Now she can't stand on a portico
And whistle when
She goes walking by, oh no no
She must hope that he can see
The lovin' light burnin'
In her eyes, oh yeah yeah
She can't ask him
To let her walk him home, oh no
Nor can she ask him
For the number
The number on his telephone, oh no
When a boy meets a girl, yeah
That he wants for the rest of his life
He just walks right up to her
And says, "darling, please be my wife"

Somebody tell me
Tell me, tell me
What does a girl do?
(what does a girl do?)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
