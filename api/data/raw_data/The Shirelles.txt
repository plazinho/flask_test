Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me..2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my mama said

I went walking the other day

And then I almost lost my mind
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my mama said
My eyes are wide open, but all that I can see is
Chapel bells are callin' for everyone but a me
But I don't worry 'cause
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my mama said
And then she said someone will look at me
Like I'm looking at you one day, then I might find
I don't want it any old way, so I don't worry 'cause
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this my mama said
Mama said, mama said
Hey, don't you worry
Mama said, mama said
Hey, don't you worry now
Mama said, mama said

This is dedicated to the one I love
While I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
Life can never be exactly like we want it to be
I can be satisfied just knowing that you love me
There's one thing I want you to do especially for me
And it's something that everybody needs
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You broke his heart and made him cry
And he's been blue since then
Now he's found somebody new
And you want him back again
Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do
"But I love him"
No you don't, it's just your pride that's hurt!
"I still love him"
If you got him back again, you'd go right out and do him dirt!
Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do
"But I love him"
It's too late to have a change of heart!
"I still love him"
Tomorrow is his wedding day and you'll keep quiet if you're smart!
Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do
Forget him cause he don't belong to you
It's too late he's found somebody new
There's not a single thing that you can doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You say you think I'm beautiful
You say you live for my touch
Tell me the things I want to hear
Don't you know you can never say too much
You gotta keep tellin' me things I want to hear
You gotta say pretty words every time you're near
You gotta show me that you care
So I'll know you'll be there right through the years
Please tell me, please tell me things I want to hear
Pretty words, pretty words, pretty words
Tell me the words that touch my heart
Promise you want me to stay
Tell me that we will never part
Say I'm the one you'll be loving more each day
You gotta keep tellin' me things I want to hear
You gotta say pretty words every time you're near
You gotta show me that you care
So I'll know you'll be there right through the years
Please tell me, please tell me things I want to hear
