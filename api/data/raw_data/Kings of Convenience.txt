If you want to be my friend
You want us to get along
Please do not expect me to
Wrap it up and keep it there
The observation I'm doing could
Easily be understood
As cynical demeanor
But one of us misread
What do you know?
It happened again
A friend is not a means
You utilize to get somewhere
Somehow I didn't notice
Friendship is an end
What do you know?
It happened again
How come no one told me
All throughout history
The loneliest people
Were the ones who always spoke the truth
The ones who made a difference
By withstanding the indifference
I guess it's up to me now
Should I take that risk or just smile?
What do you know?
It happened again
What do you know?
 
Riding on this know-how
Never been here before
Peculiarly entrusted
Possibly that's all
Is history recorded?
Does someone have a tape?
Surely, I'm no pioneer
Constellations stay the same

Just a little bit of danger
When intriguingly
Our little secret
Trusts that you trust me
Cause no one will ever know
That this was happening
So tell me why you listen
When nobody's talking

What is there to know?
All this is what it is
You and me alone
Sheer simplicity
 
I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy
But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices blended in perfection
From the reels of this record that I've found
Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me
"What are you doing here?"
Finding all my previous motives
Growing increasingly unclear
I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
All the other options held before me
Would wither in the light of my plan
So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy
But there's only one thing on my mind
Searching boxes underneath the counter
On a chance that on a tape I'd find
A song for someone who needs somewhere to long for
Homesick
Because I no longer know where home is
 
Hey baby, Mrs. Cold
Acting so tough
Didn't know you had it in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long
You should've hooked me
Before I put my raincoat on
Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
You were frantic because you knew you'd find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey, baby, what's going on?
You lost control and you lost your tongue
You lost me, deaf in my ear
Nothing you can say is gonna change the way I feel
Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
You were frantic because you knew you'd find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it
Okay, I see
I step too close to your boundaries
You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey baby
What is love?
It was just a game
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
 
She'll be gone soon
You can have me for yourself
She'll be gone soon
You can have me for yourself
But do give
Just give me today
Or you will just scare me away
What we built is bigger
Than the sum of two
What we built is bigger
Than the sum of two
But somewhere
I lost count of my own
And somehow
I must find it alone
24 and blooming like the fields of May
25 and yearning for a ticket out
Dreams burn
But in ashes are gold
Dreams burn
But in ashes are gold
 
Through the alleyways
To cool off in the shadows
Then into the street
Following the water
There's a bearded man
Paddling in his canoe
Looks as if he has
Come all the way from the Cayman Islands
These canals, it seems
They all go in circles
Places look the same
And we're the only difference
The wind is in your hair
It's covering my view
I'm holding on to you
On a bike we've hired until tomorrow
If only they could see
If only they had been here
They would understand
How someone could have chosen
To go the length I've gone
To spend just one day riding
Holding on to you
I never thought it would be this clear
 
One more time
Let's say you give me one more time
One last chance to speak again
Let's start from what we left unsaid
And here we go

Brave enough to go climbing a wall
So high that no sunlight is seen through winter
Brave enough to go traveling around the world
Without money to eat or sleep for
Seeing what you can do with your hands and feet
I feel there is no question about it
Almost anything you can imagine
Almost any goal, you will get there

I wish you had been more of a talker
Not the kind that is just flapping his lips
And not the kind that looks away
But learns through his eyes when somеbody is watching
Maybe you could have told me
Thеre was a world on your shoulders that needed lifting
Maybe I could have helped you with that
The weight is not easy I know
But you never know

I thought your shoes were good
I thought they would take you to the end of any road
I thought your back was strong
But I should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail
(Carried you to the top of the rocky trail)
I should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail

How am I to know about your problems and your load?
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
How am I to know about your problems and your load?
I am blind to what you show
I am waiting to be told
I never ask
 
I'd rather dance with you than talk with you
So why don't we just move into the other room
There's space for us to shake
And hey, I like this tune

Even if I could hear what you said
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear
Because I haven't read a single book all year
And the only film I saw
I didn't like it at all

I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance
Than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance
Than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance
Than talk with you

The music's too loud and the noise from the crowd
Increases the chance of misinterpretation
So let your hips do the talking
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings
And you'll make me smile by really
Getting into the swing

Getting into the swing
Getting into the swing
Getting into the swing
Getting into the swing
 
Crossroads and given the option
To pass and look back at goals I've missed
Rainbows of burning bridges
If you squint a little more it looks the same
But ooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you've lost
But oooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of you in everyone
Can never keep a secret
Problem lines on your face
You smooth them out so no one can tell
Put a straight back upon a stage
Could (dance dance) hide the tremor in your hand
But ooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you've lost
But oooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of you in everyone
And I'm watching you now
I see you building the castle with one hand
While tearing down another with the other
And I'm watching you now
I see you building the castle with one hand
While tearing down another with the other
And I'm watching you now
I see you building the castle with one hand
While tearing down another with the other
 
You set yourself above
That all forgiving god
You claim that you believe in
Your kind is gonna fall
Your ship is sinking fast
And all your able men are leaving
Only someone
Who's morally
Superior can possibly
And honestly deserve
To rule my world
I talk before I think
You shoot before you know
Who's in your line of fire
So somehow we're the same
We're causing people pain
But I stand and take the blame
You scramble to deny
Only someone
Who's morally
Superior can possibly
And honestly deserve
Only someone
Who's morally
Superior can possibly
And honestly deserve
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
Explain me one more time
When they kill it's a crime
When you kill it is justice
 
What's the immaterial substance
That envelopes two
That one perceives as hunger
And the other as food
I awake in tangled covers
To a sash of snow
You dream in a cartoon garden
I could never know
Innocent imitation of how it would be
If when the music entered, you did not retreat
In my imagination, you are cast in gold
Your image a compensation for me to hold
Parallel lines, move so fast
Toward the same point
Infinity is as near as it is far
Parallel lines, move so fast
Toward the same point
Infinity is as near as it is far
 
Even though I'll never need her
Even though she's only giving me pain
I'll be on my knees to feed her
Spend a day to make her smile again
Even though I'll never need her
Even though she's only giving me pain
As the world is soft around her
Leaving me with nothing to disdain
Even though I'm not her minder
Even though she doesn't want me around
I am on my feet to find her
To make sure that she is safe and sound
Even though I'm not her minder
Even though she doesn't want me around
I am on my feet to find her
To make sure that she is safe from harm
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
Everything is new
Everything is new
Everything is new
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
