Let it go
Let it roll right off your shoulder
Don't you know?
The hardest part is over
Let it in
Let your clarity define you;
In the end
We will only just remember how it feels

Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours
Still remain

Let it slide;
Let your troubles fall behind you
Let it shine
Till you feel it all around you
And I don't mind
If it's me you need to turn to
We'll get by
It's the heart that really matters in the end
Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours
Still remain

All of my regret
Will wash away somehow
But I cannot forget
The way I feel right now

In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Yeah, these twists and turns of fate

Time falls away
Yeah, but these small hours
And these small hours
Still remain
Yeah
Oh they still remain
These little wonders
Oh, these twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These little wonders
Still remain10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Run away, run away if you can't speak
Turn a page on a world that you don't need
Wide awake and you're scared that you won't come down now

Didn't I tell you you were gonna break down
Didn't I warn you, didn't I warn you
Better take it easy, try to find a way out
Better start believing in yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're falling
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have

Now and then there's a light in the darkness
Feel around till you find where your heart went
There's a weight in the air but you can't see why, why
Didn't I tell you you were gonna break down
Didn't I want you, everybody wants you
Tell me what you're needing, give into your bleeding
Never any feeling for yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're falling
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have

Didn't I tell you you were gonna break down
Didn't I warn you, didn't I warn you
Better take it easy, try to find a way out
Better start believing in yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're falling
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Can you hold onto me
Can you hold onto me
Run away, run away if you can't speak5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

Now it's hard for me
With my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you
What if you were good to me
What if I could hold you 'till I feel you move inside me
And what if it was paradise
And what if we were symphonies
What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
'Oh what the hell' she says 'I just can't win for losing'
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says 'ooh
I can't take no more'
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down (way down)
Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night (all night)
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

So by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight
And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling
Oh I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She down with it
She tried her best and now she can't win, It's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down yeah
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling over her diamonds falling down
I can't take these diamonds falling down7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Another night and here we are again
All our faults laid out ahead
Let it out, then let it right back in
All those voices in your head

And we both know everything, but we can't learn to leave
So I'll tell you what you need

First thing: we make you feel better
Next stop: we pull it all together
I'll keep you warm like a sweater
Take my hand, hold on forever
Just fall apart if you need to
I'm here and I won't leave you now
Don't look down
Hold on forever

Lay down all your troubles end to end
They could reach up to the stars
So many roads, you don't know where you've been
But you still know who you are
And if I seem preoccupied, I'm wondering what to do
So here's my recipe for you

First thing: we make you feel better
Next stop: we pull it all together
I'll keep you warm like a sweater
Take my hand, hold on forever
Just fall apart if you need to
I'm here and I won't leave you now
Don't look down
Hold on forever

And we both know everything, but we can't learn to leave
So I'll tell you what you need

First thing: we make you feel better
Next stop: we pull it all together
I'll keep you warm like a sweater
Take my hand, hold on forever
Just fall apart if you need to
I'm here and I won't leave you now
Don't look down
Hold on forever
Just take my hand; hold on forever
Hold on forever
Just take my hand; hold on forever1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sunlight falls heavy
Can't hide, you’re awake already
Long night, you're unsteady
You don't even wanna be here, do you?
Cry out, not for the last time
It’s funny how a word might save your life
And I'm saying a lot right now

But I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna be here, be here now
There's a bad taste in my mouth
I stumble in the dark, tripping on a heart
It's gonna leave a mark, maybe we can stay and wait it out
You’re the one that talks me down
And even you can’t help me now
Even you can't help me now

Headlight, dark highway
Drive on, but it feels all sideways
No signs, I’m a headcase
I'm alone, but I feel you, feel you now
Head down, I can't remember
If we left on a start or an ender
You and I, we're so worn down
But I don’t wanna fight, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna be here, be here now
Like a bad taste in my mouth
I stumble in the dark, tripping on a heart
It's gonna leave a mark, maybe we can stay and wait it out
You're the one that talks me down
Even you can't help me now

And we fall, and we break
And we turn our inside out
And we're lost in a daze
For days and days and days and now
But I thought that I could turn it around

But I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna be here, be here now
There's a bad taste in my mouth
I stumble in the dark, tripping on a heart
It's gonna leave a mark, maybe we can stay and wait it out
You're the one that talks me down
And even you can't help me now (Sunlight falls heavy)
Even you can't help me now (Sunlight falls heavy)
Baby, even you can't help me now (Sunlight falls heavy)
Even you can't help me nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young

I see my life like a train with a one-way track
I've made mistakes, and I couldn't take 'em back
And I've been runnin' 'round in circles 'til I'm dizzy, I can't lie
But every night I go to sleep's a day that I survive

I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young

And I've seen my friends fall away before their time
And I've been afraid that I may follow in their light
So I drink and love and whisper all the things I know are right
Someday, I will leave this world, but maybe not tonight

I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
And I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm one less day from dying young (Yeah)
All my life I have been wandering
Burning up my candle like my time just won't end
And I'll keep burning 'til there's nothing left
Praying that tomorrow I can do it all again
And if I get tomorrow, I will do it all again

I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
And I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
Hey

I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm one less day from dying young2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We were drawn from the weeds
We were brave like soldiers
Falling down under the pale moonlight
You were holding to me
Like a someone broken
And I couldn't tell you but I'm telling you now
Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down
Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same
We would stand in the wind
We were free like water
Flowing down
Under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold and we're scared
And we've both been shaken
Yeah, look at us man
This doesn't need to be the end
Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down
Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same
Call on me
And I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me
Forever it's you, forever in me, ever the same
You may need me there
To carry all your weight
But you're no burden I assure
You tide me over
With a warmth I'll not forget
But I can only give you love
Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same
Call on me
Well I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me
Forever it's you, forever in me, ever the same
Forever in you, forever in me, ever the same1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You can go
You can start all over again
You can try to find a way to make another day go by
You can hide
Hold all your feelings inside
You can try to carry on when all you wanna do is cry

And maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
Try to put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to make things better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

Now we wait
And try to find another mistake
If you throw it all away, then maybe you can change your mind
You can run
And when everything is over and done
You can shine a little light on everything around you
Man, it’s good to be someone

I don’t wanna wait
I just wanna know
I just wanna hear you tell me so
Give it to me straight
Tell it to me slow

‘Cause maybe someday we’ll figure all this out
We’ll put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to just to feel better now that
Maybe someday we’ll live our lives out loud
We’ll be better off somehow, someday

‘Cause sometimes we don’t really notice
Just how good it can get
So maybe we should start all over
Start all over, again7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
All my friends say "when you gon' play?"
I'm always too busy, I don't need to stay up late
But I change my mind when I see your face
Cause I trust you
Now it's on like Revlon, middle of the night
Gimme just a minute, man, I'm higher than a kite
And I can't come down, but I know I'll be all right
Because I trust you

When you say "hey, come on,"
I know I really, really want to
I trust you
When I stay, I know I really ought to go
But then I trust you
I trust you
I trust you
When you say "hey, come on"
I know I will because I trust you
I trust you

I like to think that I am reasonable
But I can't tell you why I'm down on the floor
I check my hair, but I don't know what it's for
I know tomorrow that I'll trust you some more
When you say "hey, come on,"
I know I really, really want to
I trust you
When I stay, I know I really ought to go
But then I trust you
I trust you
I trust you
When you say "hey, come on"
I know I will because I trust you
I trust you

I keep on making bad decisions cause I
I keep on drinking what you're giving cause I
I keep on making bad decisions cause I
I keep on drinking what you're giving cause I

When you say "hey, come on,"
I know I really, really want to
I trust you
When I stay, I know I really ought to go
But then I trust you
I trust you
I trust you
When you say "hey, come on"
I know I will because I trust you
I trust you

Don't you wanna go for a ride
Just keep your hands inside
And make the most out of life
Now don't you take it for granted
Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess outta me
It left me caught between
Like an angry dream I was stranded
I was stranded

And I'm steady but I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take

Well this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks

Don't you wanna go for a ride
Down to the other side
Feels so good you could cry
Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Yeah, once we were so fine, you and I
Why you gotta make it so hard on me?
It's hard on me
And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
And I'm running, but you're getting away

Well this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
Well this is how a heart breaks

You're not the best thing that I knew
Never was, never cared too much for all this hanging around
It's just the same thing all the time
Never get what I want, never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew
Back before the time when I was running for you

Hell this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
Hell this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks

Can't take it
Can't take it
Can't take it
Can't take it
This is how a heart breaks
Can't take it no more
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
This is how a heart breaks
