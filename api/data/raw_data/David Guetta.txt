No limit in the sky that I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes that I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you

Want you to share that
When it comes to you

Cupid ain't a lie, arrow got your name on it, oh, yeah
Don't miss out on a love and regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you

Want you to share that (Share)
When it comes to you
Want you to share that

You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Stone heart, machine gun
Fired at the ones who run
Stone heart, as bulletproof glass

You shoot me down, but I won't fall

I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Don't leave me a...

Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
I don't wanna call and you not answer
Never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing "Tiny Dancer"
Everytime my head hurts, everytime I'm low

'Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything about you uncomplicated
Here with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Don't leave me a...

Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha (make me, alo..)
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No, oh

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Yo, I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma Guetta
Twenty mil' on my off, season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me
Pretty and icy
You get it? Icy
But my name is spelled N-I-C

I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me
Light my body up

Girl you know I brought that thing right up out the darkness
Made that thing a starfish, right up on my swordfish
I'ma bring sparks and your favorite narcs
Ooooh, you raise the bar, you take it far, you rated R
But keep it tight tight, take this D, go night night
Go so far downtown on you, I lose Wi-Fi
Give me high five
'Cause you know you gon' need a goon to come lick, lick your wounds
Got you lit like tick tick tick, like tick tick tick
Tick tick, Tune

You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my (Mula)
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night

A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start?
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like a deer in love lights

You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

Did she lie and wait?
Was I bait to pull you in?
The thrill of the kill
You feel is a sin
I lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees

Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
(Damn, girl)

Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl

Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side, the hunger satisfied

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun


We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the door
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's worth dying for
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride!
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun


Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
And show the world, a burning light
They've never shined so bright37EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy, feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy Dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dance floor, bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard, blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy off the Crazy Juice
This will end up on the news
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy Dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her

Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Ultra sexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer, beating like a disco drum
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)

Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you looking alive
It's obvious that I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do

If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

I want your love to touch me, one touch will feel free
(It would bring me to life)
I want to feel free, so I can finally be (If you kiss me)
So I can finally be (Girl), so I can finally be (Give me now)
So I can finally see, so I can finally see (Give me now)
What, what, what

Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty

When you're faded and alone
And need somebody on the phone
Let it be me, let it be me
When she leaves you in the rain
You need a high to kill the pain
Let it be me, let it be me
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da

Summer days, winter nights
Ride or die, right by your side
Killing time till you're ready to see I'm all you need
You're a drunk, you're a fool
I'm insane, so right for you
When the ship goes down
Look in your dreams, that's where I'll be
'Cause I ne-ne-ne-need you
And I la-la-la-la-love ya
But I wanna-wanna-wanna
Just stay the night
When you're faded and alone
And need somebody on the phone
Let it be me, let it be me
When she leaves you in the rain
You need a high to kill the pain
Let it be me, let it be me
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da

'Cause I ne-ne-ne-need you
And I la-la-la-la-love ya
But I wanna-wanna-wanna
Just stay the night
And I ne-ne-ne-need you
And I la-la-la-la-love ya
Oh, no-no-no
I won't let you, won't let you go

When you're faded and alone
You need somebody on the phone
Let it be me, let it be me
When she leaves you in the rain
You need a high to kill the pain
Let it be me, let it be me
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

Oh yeah, they tell me I’m a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying...

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl

Oh, yeah, they tell me I’m a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there
Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it round just the way that I like
I wanna see you move like a movie on flight
You got it how I want and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying...

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl

She done got my heart jumping
And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain’t nobody ever seen
(Seen, seen, seen, seen, seen, seen)
As a matter of fact, I’ve seen this woman all up in my dreams
Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I’m attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I meet her I tell her David Guetta’s on the track
Baby girl, don’t stop
Keep it goin', you never know when somebody’s gonna throw a couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollar bill’s
Ludacris, Mr. Make-a-Woman-Holla
(Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing)
And every night on the floor putting on a show
(Show, show, show, show, show)
Everybody in the club, there’s a little something you should know
Look at her go on the dance floor
She’s amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it goin', girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying…

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl
Go little bad girl3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
