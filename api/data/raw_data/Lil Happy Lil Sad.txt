I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like

I've got so much shit to say
Baby take me from this place
I just really can not stay
Tears are falling down my face
I feel colder every day
Now they want me out their way
I'll be gone I'll be okay
I just need some fucking space
I walk by I feel them hate
Wanna die 'cause I relate
Wanna cry I feel insane
I get high but can't escape
Would they love me If I change?
Am I lost? Am I too late?
Soon I'm dead I cannot wait
Please don't love me it's a waste
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like

Wanna die so fucking bad
You're the best I've ever had
Wanna die when I look back
Cause you always made me sad
Can't get over shit I'm done
I just make another song
Nothing helps I'm fucking numb
I'll be gone bitch pass the blunt
I've been hurting for so long
Baby kill me in your thoughts
I've been dying all along
Let me go where I belong
Get me drunk bitch, get me high
Give me pills and let me vibe
When it's time just let me die
I'm so tired of this life56EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'mma break down soon, in the same old room, that I always do
I feel so alone, make some beats and smoke, pray I make it soon
Pray they buy my shit, 'cause I'm so damn broke
Girl, I'm so damn cold, I might freeze to death
Rollin' up some dope, smoking trees for stress
Fuck the life I had, I don't want it back
Fuck the friends I had, they just made me sad
Now it's me and her, 'bout to fuck the world
We don't need no help, we came up from dirt
I still hate myself, that's a side of me
Wanna kill myself, and I've tried I'm weak
Mom would drive me in, every time I did
I would ask to leave, and they'd give me pills
That shit on repeat, every other week
They would numb me down, till I couldn't speak
Lay me down, I don't wanna die
I can't sleep alone, need you here tonight
You were everything, you were my god damn life
Now its all fucked up, and I won't sleep tonight
I was snorting pills, you were up all night
I swear I couldn't feel, I was so damn high
Liquor in my blood, you were all I want
I gave you everything, I feel so unloved
You finally got exactly what you want
You were off getting fucked and I was so fucked up
Fuck the wedding ring fuck this life I lead
Got me feeling numb doing bumps off keys
I don't wanna live, tried to kill myself
Girl, I'll numb you too, take your life as well
I wanna watch you bleed, she gets numb for me
Let's kill ourselves, so I can sleep7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She told me I was nothing and it hurt
She used to make me happy and feel special with her words
I tried to shed some light on all the dark inside of her
She used to be my everything and now I'm off the drugs

I fell to the ground, I'm smoking all the time
Just tryna survive, I might kill myself tonight
I never fucking know, when I'm gonna go
'Cause one day I am happy, next I'm strangled by the noose
I fell to the ground, crying all the time
Sadness in my sound, I am always on the grind
I'm always feeling low, stuck inside my mind
I just wanna go, but I never seem to die

Always in my bed, I made her leave me here alone
Screaming at her crying, I would point her to the door
All I ever want is her to be here when I'm low
I try to act unbothered but I end up hurting more
Always in my bed, I made her leave me here alone
Screaming at her crying, I would point her to the door
All I ever want is her to be here when I'm low
I try to act unbothered but I end up hurting more
I fell to the ground, I'm smoking all the time
Just tryna survive, I might kill myself tonight
I never fucking know, when I'm gonna go
'Cause one day I am happy, next I'm strangled by the noose
I fell to the ground, crying all the time
Sadness in my sound, I am always on the grind
I'm always feeling low, stuck inside my mind
I just wanna go, but I never seem to die11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I know I did before but I don't fuckin' love you no more
You made me hate myself, girl, did you love me at all
I tried to kill myself, girl, you wouldn't pick up my calls
I know you knew what I was doing, but you wanted me gone
I don't care 'cause someone else is fucking waiting for me
She got everything you don't, she is all that I need
See me smile, see me rolling, see me smoking my weed
Can't believe I wasted time 'cause now I'm starting to heal
Ever since you fucking left I've been moving my ways
Making music every day, helps me handle the pain
Making music every day is a highway to fame
I don't chase but I want it, girl, remember my name

I'll be one of them
You'll never see me, girl, again
If I don't kill myself
This scene is mine, girl, my revenge
I'll be one of them
You'll never see me, girl, again
If I don't kill myself
This scene is mine, girl, my revengeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You remind me of the good times
You remind me how I used to feel
You get me ridin' on some good vibes
You remind me how it used to be
You remind me of the good times
Shawty give me good vibes, bitch it's real
You put me in a good mind
Shawty give me good highs and it's so surreal

I feel no shame, girl I'm a no name
If I go my own way, will you still stay?
If I ever have to go, will you let me?
Switchin' lanes, if I fall, will you help me?
You is always on my mind, can't believe it
How I tried to make you mine and I reached it
And I'm still getting high, 'cause I need it
On the surface I am fine, what's beneath it
Am I dreaming, girl what's our reason?
I try to find myself in here
Like girl, what's my meaning?
Feel like I'm sleeping
Get low from my feelings
Get high to relieve it
I fly and I'm leaving
I feel no shame, girl I'm a no name
If I find my own lane, will you still stay?
I'm beaten down and I cry, I can't feel shit
Then I look into your eyes and I feel it

You remind me of the good times
You remind me how I used to feel
You get me ridin' on some good vibes
You remind me how it used to be
You remind me of the good times
Shawty give me good vibes, bitch it's real
You put me in a good mind
Shawty give me good highs and it's so surreal

It's only been two days since I saw you
And I already miss you (already miss you)
And I depend on you, you've got the shots up in your pistol
And yeah I treat you good, treat you like a fuckin' crystal
See I don't really know if I'm talkin 'bout a girl or if I'm talkin' 'bout a drug
No they have not been told
They don't look into my eyes and see the fuckin' dark I hold
I lay so low
I really just want you here right now
'Cause baby I am shameless
Or Ima just lay you, lay you down
And I know, yeah I know
That you wanna fuckin' know what's beneath me
On the surface I am fine, what's beneath it?
You remind me of the good times
You remind me how I used to feel
You get me ridin' on some good vibes
You remind me how it used to be
You remind me of the good times
Shawty give me good vibes, bitch it's real
You put me in a good mind

I can't shake this fucking feeling that something's wrong
I tied some rope to the ceiling and I put it on

Stuck inside my mind, dying on the inside
I get high all night cause I fucking hate my life

I thought that I had told myself
Not to fucking fall in love
Now I fucking find myself
Singing to you in my songs
I'm sure I'm gonna hurt you, girl
So you better stay away
Know that you're at loss for words
I just don't know what else to say

I don't wanna be
The reason that you bleed
Girl, you better leave
Yeah, I'm tryna make you see
You're better off alone
At least you'll still be free
While I'm smoking weed
For the scars, I'm tryna heal
I don't wanna be
The reason that you bleed
Girl, you better leave
Yeah, I'm tryna make you see
You're better off alone
At least you'll still be free
While I'm smoking weed
For the scars, I'm tryna heal
While I find myself
While I find myself
While I find myself
I'll never find myself3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Babe I know I've done you wrong
I can hear it in your songs
I can see it on your face
Won't be long 'fore I'm replaced
I'll miss the times we had
And I'll miss the laughs we shared
I'll miss staying up 'till midnight
And the times when everything felt right

When the blood drips I feel nothing
I can't discuss it I need something to numb it
Baby girl don't hate me the sadness ate me
Now I'm so sedated on the fucking daily
I'm sorry baby find me where the pain be
In the dark creating I see the light and its fading

I don't know if I can leave you
I don't know if I believe you
All the shit you're fucking saying girl
Yeah you drive me fucking crazy girl
I never did shit now you cut me
I need to get lit for I cut me
I'm fucking sorry I can't live no more
I fucking love you girl you're magical
Baby take it all away
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna feel this way
I can see the stars on your face
I was snorting cocaine
Wanna fucking blow my own brains

I
I don't even have a plan right now
Cause I can't see tomorrow
Cause I don't even really wanna wake up
(wanna wake up)

I was asleep on the bus and I woke up to your messages
I never called you back but I still look at our images
Sometimes I wanna die but I numb it down with stimulants
Sometimes I wanna die and I act on all my impulses
I don't wanna die alone
I don't really wanna die at all
But sometimes I can't control myself
And by then I want to kill myself

Baby girl, I wanna kill myself
Baby girl, I think I'll kill myself
Baby girl, I wanna kill myself
Baby girl, I'll prolly kill myself

Kill myself
Kill myself
Kill myself
I wanna kill myself2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
