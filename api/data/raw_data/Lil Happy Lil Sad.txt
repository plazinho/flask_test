I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like

I've got so much shit to say
Baby take me from this place
I just really can not stay
Tears are falling down my face
I feel colder every day
Now they want me out their way
I'll be gone I'll be okay
I just need some fucking space
I walk by I feel them hate
Wanna die 'cause I relate
Wanna cry I feel insane
I get high but can't escape
Would they love me If I change?
Am I lost? Am I too late?
Soon I'm dead I cannot wait
Please don't love me it's a waste

I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place to call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like
I'm feelin' lost and Ion know where else to go now
Ion really have a place call my home now
Everybody hatin' and I feel so cold now
Why do everybody make me feel alone like

Wanna die so fucking bad
You're the best I've ever had
Wanna die when I look back
Cause you always made me sad
Can't get over shit I'm done
I just make another song
Nothing helps I'm fucking numb
I'll be gone bitch pass the blunt
I've been hurting for so long
Baby kill me in your thoughts
I've been dying all along
Let me go where I belong
Get me drunk bitch, get me high
Give me pills and let me vibe
When it's time just let me die
I'm so tired of this life
 
I'mma break down soon, in the same old room, that I always do
I feel so alone, make some beats and smoke, pray I make it soon
Pray they buy my shit, 'cause I'm so damn broke
Girl, I'm so damn cold, I might freeze to death
Rollin' up some dope, smoking trees for stress
Fuck the life I had, I don't want it back
Fuck the friends I had, they just made me sad
Now it's me and her, 'bout to fuck the world
We don't need no help, we came up from dirt
I still hate myself, that's a side of me
Wanna kill myself, and I've tried I'm weak
Mom would drive me in, every time I did
I would ask to leave, and they'd give me pills
That shit on repeat, every other week
They would numb me down, till I couldn't speak

Lay me down, I don't wanna die
I can't sleep alone, need you here tonight
You were everything, you were my god damn life
Now its all fucked up, and I won't sleep tonight
I was snorting pills, you were up all night
I swear I couldn't feel, I was so damn high
Liquor in my blood, you were all I want
I gave you everything, I feel so unloved
You finally got exactly what you want
You were off getting fucked and I was so fucked up
Fuck the wedding ring fuck this life I lead
Got me feeling numb doing bumps off keys
I don't wanna live, tried to kill myself
Girl, I'll numb you too, take your life as well
I wanna watch you bleed, she gets numb for me
Let's kill ourselves, so I can sleep
 
She told me I was nothing and it hurt
She used to make me happy and feel special with her words
I tried to shed some light on all the dark inside of her
She used to be my everything and now I'm off the drugs

I fell to the ground, I'm smoking all the time
Just tryna survive, I might kill myself tonight
I never fucking know, when I'm gonna go
'Cause one day I am happy, next I'm strangled by the noose
I fell to the ground, crying all the time
Sadness in my sound, I am always on the grind
I'm always feeling low, stuck inside my mind
I just wanna go, but I never seem to die

Always in my bed, I made her leave me here alone
Screaming at her crying, I would point her to the door
All I ever want is her to be here when I'm low
I try to act unbothered but I end up hurting more
Always in my bed, I made her leave me here alone
Screaming at her crying, I would point her to the door
All I ever want is her to be here when I'm low
I try to act unbothered but I end up hurting more

I fell to the ground, I'm smoking all the time
Just tryna survive, I might kill myself tonight
I never fucking know, when I'm gonna go
'Cause one day I am happy, next I'm strangled by the noose
I fell to the ground, crying all the time
Sadness in my sound, I am always on the grind
I'm always feeling low, stuck inside my mind
I just wanna go, but I never seem to die
 
I know I did before but I don't fuckin' love you no more
You made me hate myself, girl, did you love me at all
I tried to kill myself, girl, you wouldn't pick up my calls
I know you knew what I was doing, but you wanted me gone
I don't care 'cause someone else is fucking waiting for me
She got everything you don't, she is all that I need
See me smile, see me rolling, see me smoking my weed
Can't believe I wasted time 'cause now I'm starting to heal
Ever since you fucking left I've been moving my ways
Making music every day, helps me handle the pain
Making music every day is a highway to fame
I don't chase but I want it, girl, remember my name

I'll be one of them
You'll never see me, girl, again
If I don't kill myself
This scene is mine, girl, my revenge
I'll be one of them
You'll never see me, girl, again
If I don't kill myself
This scene is mine, girl, my revenge
 
You remind me of the good times

Switchin' lanes, if I fall, will you help me?
You is always on my mind, can't believe it
How I tried to make you mine and I reached it
And I'm still getting high, 'cause I need it
On the surface I am fine, what's beneath it
Am I dreaming, girl what's our reason?
I try to find myself in here
Like girl, what's my meaning?
Feel like I'm sleeping
Get low from my feelings
Get high to relieve it
I fly and I'm leaving

I feel no shame, girl I'm a no name
If I find my own lane, will you still stay?

See I don't really know if I'm talkin 'bout a girl or if I'm talkin' 'bout a drug
No they have not been told
They don't look into my eyes and see the fuckin' dark I hold
I lay so low
I really just want you here right now
'Cause baby I am shameless
Or Ima just lay you, lay you down
And I know, yeah I know
That you wanna fuckin' know what's beneath me
On the surface I am fine, what's beneath it?

Stuck inside my mind, dying on the inside
I get high all night cause I fucking hate my life

I thought that I had told myself
Not to fucking fall in love
Now I fucking find myself
Singing to you in my songs
I'm sure I'm gonna hurt you, girl
So you better stay away
Know that you're at loss for words
I just don't know what else to say

I don't wanna be
The reason that you bleed
Girl, you better leave
Yeah, I'm tryna make you see
You're better off alone
At least you'll still be free
While I'm smoking weed
For the scars, I'm tryna heal
I don't wanna be
The reason that you bleed
Girl, you better leave
Yeah, I'm tryna make you see
You're better off alone
At least you'll still be free
While I'm smoking weed
For the scars, I'm tryna heal

While I find myself
While I find myself
While I find myself
I'll never find myself
 
Babe I know I've done you wrong
I can hear it in your songs
I can see it on your face
Won't be long 'fore I'm replaced
I'll miss the times we had
And I'll miss the laughs we shared
I'll miss staying up 'till midnight
And the times when everything felt right

When the blood drips I feel nothing
I can't discuss it I need something to numb it
Baby girl don't hate me the sadness ate me
Now I'm so sedated on the fucking daily
I'm sorry baby find me where the pain be
In the dark creating I see the light and its fading

All the shit you're fucking saying girl

Wanna fucking blow my own brains

I don't even have a plan right now
Cause I can't see tomorrow
Cause I don't even really wanna wake up
(wanna wake up)
(wanna wake up)
(wanna wake...)
 
I was asleep on the bus and I woke up to your messages
I never called you back but I still look at our images
Sometimes I wanna die but I numb it down with stimulants
Sometimes I wanna die and I act on all my impulses
I don't wanna die alone
I don't really wanna die at all
But sometimes I can't control myself
And by then I want to kill myself

Baby girl, I wanna kill myself
Baby girl, I think I'll kill myself
Baby girl, I wanna kill myself
Baby girl, I'll prolly kill myself

Kill myself

I wanna kill myself
 
Yeah, I love you and I want you to smile
Get the drugs, boo, yeah, let's smoke and get high
Dripping blood tho', I got death on my mind
Got this urge, hoe, wanna cut till I die
And I don't want to, but I fuck it all up
I feel so damn low, can't control it at times
And it hurts you, I don't want you to cry
Cause I love you, and I want to you smile, yeah

And it hurts you I don't want you to cry

I feel so damn low, can't control it at times
And it hurts you, I don't want you to cry
Cause I love you and I want to you smile, yeah
 
I met you and my heart froze, yeah
But for once I wasn't cold
My whole world
It was put on hold, ayy
I could see us both grow old
I had visions for it all
And it made me want you more
I said "Baby take a chance with me
And I'm forever yours"
I said "Girl we could get rich
We can sing, lets make some hits"
You said "Sure and took my hand"
Been recording ever since
It was me and you alone
No one was supposed to know
Now they bumpin' all our shit
Acting like we owe them more
But I guess this is the life
That we chose, it stress me out
But it's slowly getting better
And I love that we got clout
We had nothing but each other
When we first was starting out
Look at how they talking now
Acting like they know us now
They don't know
They don't know shit
They don't know
They don't know me
Only you
Fucking know me
Only you
Really know me

Baby I miss you when you're not with me
I think about you fucking constantly
Want you to fulfill your dreams with me
I know we'll make it they'll see
Babe I know you have it tough
I know that life's not enough
But baby trust me it gets better
I know I'm the one for you forget her
 
Wake up no motivation
For months now no inspiration
Spiral back to depression
When will I learn my lessons?

I don't know if I can keep on walking (on walking)
Not having fun no 'cause the money's talkin' (talkin')
I'm feeling empty so I keep on searchin' (on searchin')
I keep on trying but it's just not worth it (not worth it)
Wanna pack my shit and leave this place (leave this place)
Sick of waiting for no better days (better days)
I got nothing wanna run away (run away)
Wasn't meant to be then fuck my fate

Wake up no motivation
For months now no inspiration
Spiral back to depression
When will I learn my lessons?

You won't, you can't
Nah you're the worst
And you suck at all
That you do
You had it all
You fucked it up and
It's never coming back to you

Give up, don't try
You're just gon' fail
And you know it
To be true
You fucked it up
And it's too late
Now there's nothing
Left for you to do (to do)

I'll do it anyway
Get the fuck out my face
Don't give a fuck what you say
I don't fuck with change
But it's a part of the game
And guess I'm in it to play
So I try anyway
Get the fuck out my face
If I give up it's too late
I got nothing to blame
Think I'm going insane
I'll be dead at this rate
 
I give her all my love
At least I'm trying
I give her all I have
And she been rising

I'm numb been smoking drugs
And now I'm flying
I tell her that I can't
When I am crying

When I am crying alone
I look for you on my phone
Write you a text and feel low
Delete that shit and then smoke

I don't wanna lose you now
I just wanna smoke this loud and get high with you
I don't wanna lose my mind but I'm afraid I will if I keep up with the shit I do

I don't wanna lose you now
I just wanna smoke this loud and get high with you
I don't wanna lose my mind but I'm afraid I will if I keep up with the shit I do
 
Spending too much time in my brain
Making money but I'm not happy at all
Getting high and I look for new ways
But everything is so hopeless I fall

If nothing change
I'll be in my grave
In a better place
Warm summer rain
I'm in mental pain
Wash it all away
Miss feeling safe
Watch as I fade
Tears down my face
Is it too late
For my life to change
Leave it to my face

I'm breaking to pieces, don't wanna live
I can't shake this feeling I'm soaking in
Life's got no purpose, you're making it
To me that means nothing when life's a bitch
I'm tired of just waiting for nothing
If there's a line I have crossed it
All that I want yeah I got it
I still wanna die I can't stop it
(I still wanna die I can't stop it)
(I still wanna die I can't stop it)

Spending too much time in my brain
Making money but I'm not happy at all
Getting high and I look for new ways
But everything is so hopeless I fall

If nothing change
I'll be in my grave
In a better place
Warm summer rain
I'm in mental pain
Wash it all away
Miss feeling safe
Watch as I fade
Tears down my face
Is it too late
For my life to change
Leave it to my face
 
I'm always on my fucking phone
I'm always off the fucking dope
I never wanted you to go
I always cry when i'm alone
I'm off the dope
I'm in my room
I'm feelin' lost n alone
One glass of whiskey i mix that w coke

I'm on my own
Girl if you need me you got me
Just call on my phone
Rollin' a blunt
I got nothing to lose
I got nothing left to lose, to lose
I gave it up for you, for you
I feel nothing when I'm low, I'm low
My world is always going slow, so slow
 
No time, so stressed
I just wanna die I'm only positive in drug tests
So high, deep breaths
White sauce baby drippin down your skinny breasts
I cry, she left
Now I count every second till I'm fuckin dead
More smiles, feel less
I'm alive baby but I've been so close to death
I'm alive but I've been so fuckin close to death
I get high to get rid of all the fuckin stress
Coming down and I know that I'm a fuckin mess
Cutting ties baby and I never have regrets
Fuck fake people, fake friends fuck you
Wish I didn't waste my time nah I hate you
And I've been on my shit, feeling good without you
Fuck my old gang bunch of fucking see throughs

I wish I didn't waste my time I fucking hate you
Baby, please come home again I'll break too
And I don't want to live alone without you
Even though I tried I'll fucking doubt you
I don't wanna be alone
I'll try this one more time and then I'm on my own
I just wanna feel your touch want you to come back home
Everything will be alright but I'm just so alone
Please don't call my phone
I can't do this on my own
I just wanna feel your touch
You said you fucking loved me I can't feel your love
The times you said you cared you couldn't give a fuck
And now my arms are bleeding cause my wrists are cut
Bitch I'm out of luck and I'm just so fucked up
And I don't wanna live alone without you
I swear to god I fucking hate you
I promised you the world I fucking gave you
Your heart never left my hands I'm faced to
Shatter it to pieces all again
Your skin was so soft you're always running through my head
I just can't believe those fucking words that you said
Shred through me like bullets I wish I was fucking dead, fucking dead

I wish I didn't waste my time I fucking hate you
Baby, please come home again I'll break too
And I don't want to live alone without you
Even though I tried I'll fucking doubt you
I don't wanna be alone
I'll try this one more time and then I'm on my own
I just wanna feel your touch want you to come back home
Everything will be alright but I'm just so alone
 
I need you
You love me
Please turn back and please don't walk
Asking them to free me

I know why you're gone
I know why you're leaving
Scars that can't be healed
Open still and bleeding
Put you in a snare
I'd never get out of
What you seen in me
I'll never be free from
I'm deranged, I'm fucking crazy
Fucking stupid and I'm lazy
Baby save me from myself
Fuck my fate, it's fucking stupid
Fucking hate this life and music
Baby save me from this hell

I need you
You love me
Please turn back and please don't walk
Asking them to free me

I always needed something but no matter what I got
I always needed more but then I never had enough
Rollin' one up, down with the pain
There is no stop to the ache in my brain

I need you
You love me
Please turn back and please don't walk
Asking them to free me

(Please turn back and please don't walk)
