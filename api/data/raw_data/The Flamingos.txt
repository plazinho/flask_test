My love must be a kind of blind love;
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)

Please wait for me; for I shall return;
My love for you will forever burn
Though we must part;
There's no reason to cry
Just say so long;
Because lovers never say goodbye
I love you;
My darling more than life itself
I wouldn't try to hurt you;
For I'd only be hurting my self
Just kiss me dear;
And hold me tight;
For you know this is not our last night
Though we must part;
There's no reason to cry
Just say so long;
Because lovers never say goodbyeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
A kiss, from your lips
Changed my whole life around
A kiss like yours
No where can be found
Gee gee how blest I am
To have a kiss from your lips
A kiss from your lips
Holds a story still untold
A kiss from your lips
More precious oh than gold
Gee gee how blest I am
To have a kiss from your lips
I've loved for many years
And kissed oh oh a thousand lips
But nothing went right
Until that night
I slipped a kiss
From your lips
A kiss from your lips
Changed my whole life around
Gee gee how blest I am
To have a kiss
From your lipsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
(Wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
Once more our love will be free
At the corner drugstore
Each Saturday we would meet
(We would meet)
I'd walk you home in the moonlight
All of these things we'll repeat
So darling, as I write this letter
Here's hoping you're thinking of me
My time's about up
So long until I'll be home to start serving you
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
(Wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
All of these things we'll repeat
So, darling, as I write this letter
Here's hoping, here's hoping you're thinking of me
Because my time's about up, doll
So long until I'll be home to start serving you
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
(Wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
Once more our love will be freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I can't be lying.  Can't you see that I'm crying?
Would I be crying if I were lying to you?
My heart is about to break, I regret making my mistake
My love for you burns the same, and my tears can't put out the flame

Won’t you forgive me, Oh, darling, forgive me
You must believe me, I will always be true
Would I be crying my heart out for you, and hurting the way I do
Would I be crying if I were lying to you

Won’t you forgive me, Oh, darling, forgive me
You must believe me, I will always be true
Would I be crying my heart out for you, and hurting the way I do
Would I be crying if I were lying to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken
One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Tonight
I mustn't think of her
Music maestro please

Tonight
Tonight I must forget
How much I need her
So mister leader

Play
Your  melodies
Ragtime, jazztime, swing

Any old thing
To help me ease the pain
That solitude
Solitude can bring

She used to like waltzes
So please don't play a waltz
She danced divinely
And I love her so
But there I go
Tonight I mustn't think of her
No more memories
Swing out
Tonight I must forget

Music
(Music)
Maestro

For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice
Bless the beasts and the children
For the world can never be
The world they see
Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from a storm
Keep them safe
Keep them warm
Repeat
RepeatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm in the mood for love
I'm  in the mood for love

I'm  in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're, when you're near me
I'm  in the mood for love

Heaven  is in your eyes
Bright as the star we're under
Oh,  is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fail
We've  put our hearts together
Now we are one
(I'm not afraid)
No, no, no

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight forget it
'Cause I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood for loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
How long can a girl keep goin'
Like every day's the last
I've paid off the rent and the government
Maybe I could pay off the past
If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
Wouldn't I be on easy street
Livin' this life of mine
I could keep right on till the hurt's all gone
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lotEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I still can't believe it, I can't see it
I should just stop counting days
On the subject of the future
Wouldn't it be nice to leave it open-ended
And pretend it could go either way?
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say, yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back, if I could have you back
On the topic of the time we spent together
I can't say I never wondered
If you ever think about these days
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say, yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back
It's game over, you've lost this round
And now I get to turn you down
Thanks for all the lessons learned
I'm taking in what I have heard
Practice makes perfect
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say, yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back, if I could have you back
I still can't believe it, I can't see it
I should just stop counting daysEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
