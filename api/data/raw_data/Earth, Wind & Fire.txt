Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah

Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da

My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
The true love we share today

Hey, hey, hey

Dance, boogie wonderland, hah, hah
Dance, boogie wonderland

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says "Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

Dance, boogie wonderland, hah, hah
Dance, boogie wonderland (Ooh, ooh, ooh dance, yeah)

For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
Temperature's rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
And I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la

After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons, love
Love was left aside

I'm longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baby
Ooh, baby


Yeah, reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear
And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
Find our reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Had no pride

After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons, love
Love was left aside

Yeah, where, yeah where, ooh, baby
I can't find the reasons
That my love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you, baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Can't find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya, real tight
Can't find the reasons
Baby, yeah
For my tears
Can't find the reasons
Why I love ya
 
Yeah, hey, hey

When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far, yeah
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah

To these words of heed
Be a giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom
Yes, I can
