Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you
Anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching
You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart
And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping
For the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're going down, down (down, down)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
 
Du du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
 
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity - oh Hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart

You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
 
I'm going to make it bend and break
(It sent you to me without wings...) Say a prayer, but let the
Good times roll, in case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"

Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal
Ball...
It's always cloudy except for (Except for...)
When you look into the past (Look into the past...)
One night stand...
One night stand off!

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"

They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter," whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
(For the memories) "See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter," whoa...
 
They say we are what we are, but we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

Oh, I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass, glass
Oh, I try to picture me without you, but I can’t

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals
Immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again every day
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures

Oh, I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass, glass
Oh, I try to picture me without you, but I can’t

Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals

And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down

We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long

We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals
Immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals
 
I was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you
You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones

I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
But only for you, but only for you
My head is stripped, just like a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you, when I think of you
I will shield you from the waves if they find you
I will protect you, I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one
Even if it's not true, even if it's not true, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of...

I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
Oh, you drain all the fear from me
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
You drain the fear from me

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from

You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark

Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
(Left left left right left)
(Left left left right left)
(Left left left right left)

My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
 
She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "No one should ever feel like..."

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ)

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake, and I

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me...

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
 
I think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm 'bout to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision, so stuck, night vision
But I come to life, come to life

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah

Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, real living, fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies

Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
I testify, I testify, are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance

Hey, hey, hey
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?

The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance
 
Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
 
Put on your war paint

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass

So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Put on your war paint

The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
The war is won before it's begun
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
Release the doves, surrender love
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Put on your war paint
 
I was, I was, I was, I was
Gonna say something that would solve all our problems
But then I got drunk and I forgot what I was talking about
I forgot what I was talking about
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody but you
Than to be loved by everybody but you, but you

If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see
Any of you again, never see any of you again

I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number, but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

Woke up on the wrong side of p-p-paradise
And when I say I'm sorry I'm late
I wasn't showing up at all
I really mean I didn't plan on showing up at all
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended with you
I miss the days when I pretended with you, with you

If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see
Any of you again, never see any of you again

I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number, but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

If we hadn't done this thing
I think I'd be a medicine man
So I could get high on our own
Supply whenever I can
And I became such a strange shape
Such a strange shape from trying to fit in
I became such a strange shape
Such a strange shape

I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black, I'll stop wearing black
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
 
Oh na na na na na na na na na na

I never really feel a thing, I'm just kinda too froze
You were the only one, that even kinda came close
I just pinch myself, no longer comatose
I woke up, no luck, I woke up, no luck

And when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na

I got too high again, realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend, I love you to death, but I just can't
I just can't pretend, we were lovers first
Confidants but never friends, were we ever friends?

But when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down

An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight, or don't

Cause I'm past the limits
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife
Past the limits
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife

An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
I'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't

Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
 
We've gone way too fast for way too long
And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist singing

Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

Young and a menace

Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived

Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

Young and a menace

I’m just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... For the...
Fall!

Young and a menace

We've gone way too fast for way too long
 
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name

And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
 
Champion, champion

I'm calling you from the future
To let you know we've made a mistake
And there's a fog from the past that's giving me, giving me
Such a headache
And I'm back with a madness, I'm a champion
Of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside
I got nothing but dreams

I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah

If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything

Champion, champion
Champion, champion

I got rage every day, on the inside
The only thing I do is sit around and kill the time
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light
I'm trying to blow out the light

I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe

If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything

Champion, champion, I can do anything
Champion, champion, and I can do anything
Champion, champion, and I can do anything
Champion, champion, I can do anything!

If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
(I can do anything, I can do anything)
If I can live through this
(If I can live through this, if I can live through, live through)
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, if I can live, yeah, yeah)
If I can live through this, I could do anything
(If I can live, yeah, I could do anything)
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
(I can do anything, I can do anything)
If I can live through this
(I can do anything, I can do anything)

Champion, champion
 
Have you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monastery, go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane? (Passenger plane)

Oh, permanent jet lag, please take me back (Please take me back)
Please take me back, oh ohh, I'm a stray dog
Sick, please let me in (Please let me in), the mad key's
Tripping, singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen, call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I wanna blow off steam
And call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in


It feels like fourteen carats, but no clarity, when I look at the
Man who would be king, the man who would be king
Goes to the desert, the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said, "We won, oh, we won"

Permanent jet lag, please take me back (Please take me back)
Please take me back, oh ooh, I'm a stray dog
Sick, please let me in (Please let me in), the mad key's
Tripping, singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen, call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I wanna blow off steam
And call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor (ooh), don't let the doctor in (ooh)


Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, ahh
Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, ahh

Only one book really matters, the rest
Of the proof is on the television, on the

Woo! Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I want to blow off steam
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in, oh, uh huh, ooh...


Have you ever wanted to disappear?

It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons from around my neck
And ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me, I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring, and the kids are snoring
And my ego's in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I said!
 
I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs (yeah!)
Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah!)
We can stay young forever (yeah!)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh

Cut me off, I lost my track, it's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, cause

I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs (yeah!)
Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah!)
We can stay young forever (yeah!)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend

Tonight I'm high as a private jet, yeah

(Yeah!) Let's be alone together (yeah!)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
Scream it from the top of your lungs
Say, yeah, (yeah!) let's be alone together (yeah)
We could stay young forever (yeah!)
We'll stay young-yo-yo-young, I-I-

I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
 
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, I'd get on my knees

I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees

Take the pain, make it billboard
Big and swallow it for me
Time capsule for the future
Trust me, that's what I will be
Oh, the things that you do in the
Name of what you love
You are doomed but just enough
You are doomed but just enough

If you were church, whoo, I'd get on my knees, yeah
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees

I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees

I love the world, but I just don't love the
Way it makes me feel
Got a few more fake friends and
It's getting hard to know what's real
And if death is the last appointment
Then we're all just sitting in the waiting room (Mr. Stump?)
I am just a human trying to
Avoid my certain doom

If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees

I'd get on my knees, yeah, oh
I'd get on my knees, ah ah ah
I'd get on my knees, yeah
I'd get on my knees

If you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees, yeah
 
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch, whoa...

You'll never catch us, so just let me be
Said, "I'll be fine 'til the hospital or American embassy"

Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you, oh, whoa...

They say the captain goes down with the ship
So when the world ends, will God go down with it?

Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you...


What a catch, what a catch, what a catch, what a catch, whoa...

I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will
Always know

I said, I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you


Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town...

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it...

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me...

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race...

One night, yeah and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you
Only sweeter...

Growing up
Growing up...

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch...
