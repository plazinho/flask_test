Boys call you sexy (What's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (Ha, ha)
See, every time you turn around, they screaming your name
Just call you sexy (What's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (Yeah)
See, every time you turn around, they screaming your name
(Right about now, Darkchild)

Now I've got a confession (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Anything at all for them to notice me (Ha, ha, ha, ha)

But I ain't complaining (Oh)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So, go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what it's like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say

When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
Get it?

They used to tell me I was silly (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
'Til I popped up on the TV (La, la, la, la)
I always wanted to be a superstar (Superstar) (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Who knew that singing songs would get me this far? (La, la, la, la)

But I ain't complaining (Oh)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So, go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what it's like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say

When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies

But be careful what you wish for

Get it?

I see them staring at me
Ooh, I'm a trendsetter
Yes, this is true 'cause what I do
No one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me, watching me
And I know you want it

When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines

When I get messed up at the party
I make a scene and get upset
But when I wake up in the morning
You bring me breakfast in bed and act like there's nothin' to forget

Maybe I should count my blessings
That you're just that type (Ah)
So call me masochistic
But sometimes, I want to fight

Every time﻿﻿ I leave, you pull me closer
I hang up the phone, you call me back
Why don't you mess me 'round like you're supposed to?
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react

If I say jump, you just say "How high?"
I think you might love me to death
The way you do me, boy, you're too nice
You gas me up when I wanna be losin' my breath

Maybe I should count my blessings
That you're just that type
So call me masochistic
But sometimes, I want to fight (Rrah)

Every time﻿﻿ I leave, you pull me closer
I hang up the phone, you call me back
Why don't you mess me 'round like you're supposed to?
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react
Looking for a little confrontation
Now I know the nice guys turn me bad
The less you do, the more it makes me crazy (Crazy)
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react

Every time﻿﻿ I leave, you pull me closer (Pull me closer)
I hang up the phone, you call me back
Why don't you mess me 'round like you're supposed to? (Mess me 'round)
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react
Looking for a little confrontation
Now I know the nice guys turn me bad
The less you do the more it makes me crazy
You're turning me cruel 'cause I'm just wanting you to react

Hey, hey, hey

We're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Every day, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know (I know) this is (This is) the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer (Can't take this)
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers (It's slipping through our fingers)
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye (Goodbye now)
To find a way that I can tell you

That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

Oh, I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here
 
Mmm... come on

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
Throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say (Hey)

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you

Through everything goin' on
We're right here holdin' on to one another
The reason why I love ya
Your charm and personality
I love your sensitivity
Wait... let me take a second
'Cause I'll be your love and essence
Only wanna hear your voice speak
And I feel your body heat
Love every minute of it
You're like the fresh air
When it feels like no one cares
That's why I'm saying, baby...

Nobody gonna love me better (Nobody's gon' love me better)
I must stickwitu forever (Ohh No)
Nobody gonna take me higher (Nobody)
I must stickwitu (No)
You know how to appreciate me (I know you love me)
I must stickwitu, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way, (Ohh)
I must stickwitu (Nobody)

And now
Ain't nothin else I could need (Nothin' else I could need)
And I'm
I'm singin 'cuz you're still so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you (Baby I'm with you)
Baby you're with me (Baby you're with me)

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
Baby, talk to me
Cause all I'm here to say
Is that I'll be right here for forever ever and a day, hey

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you (c'mon)
(Nobody) You know how to appreciate me (nobody)
(Nobody) I must stick with you, my baby (nobody)
(Nobody) Nobody ever made me feel this way
(Nobody) I must stick with you
You're a shelter in a storm
I'm right here
You're keeping me away from harm
I'm never gonna leave you
You're a song with beautiful words
I'm your song
Something that I never heard
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you (I love you, you're my baby)
My baby

Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you
 
Ooh, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh

I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
My love for you was strong enough, you should've known
I never needed you for judgment
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me

And it's a little late for conversations
There isn't anything for you to say
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So look at me and listen to me, because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush, hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush, hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt
I never needed you to be there every day
I'm sorry for the way I let go
On everything I wanted when you came along
But I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong

And it's a little late for explanations
There isn't anything that you can do
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So you will listen when I say
(Baby)

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush, hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush, hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

No more words
No more lies
No more crying
Ooh ooh
No more pain
No more hurt
No more tryin'
Oh, oh, yeah
Because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush, hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush, hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

Yeah, oh, oh
Hush hush, hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby...
 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh

I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
My love for you was strong enough, you should've known
I never needed you for judgment
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me

And it's a little late for conversations
There isn't anything for you to say
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So look at me and listen to me, because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush hush; hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush; hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt
I never needed you to be there every day

I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush; hush hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush hush

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But I spent oh so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
But I grew strong
I learned how to carry on
Hush hush; hush hush, I've already spoken
Our love is broken, baby
Oh no, not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give, but I will survive
I will survive! Hey, hey!
Hush hush; hush hush
There is no other way
I get the final say

I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush hush, hush hush, I've already spoken
Our love is broken, baby, hush hush
 
I see you looking at me
Like I got something that's for you (Woo)
And the way that you stare, don't you dare
'Cause I'm not about to
Just give it all up to you
'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you I don't ever wanna leave you confused

The more you try, the less I bite
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm into you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger to make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh

You know I got my own life and I bought everything that's in it
So, if you wanna be with me
It ain't all about the bling you bringing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want a love that's for real
And without that, no deal
And, baby, I don't need a hand if it only wants to grab one thing

The more you try, the less I bite
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm feeling you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger to make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (Let it go)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (No, no, no, no)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

I don't need a....
I don't need a man, I don't, a....
I don't need a man to get me through
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I feel brand new
I don't need a....
I don't need a man, I don't
I don't need a man to make it through
'Cause I know I'm fine without you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger to make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh

I don't need a man (I'm over you, yeah)
I don't need a man (Oh, I'm over you)
I don't need a man (I'm without you, I'm over you)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (I don't need ya, I don't need ya, no)
I don't need a man
Oh!
 
Everybody listen all over the world
I got a story 'bout my favorite girl, wait a minute
Oh, my baby sexy for sure
I had to have him when he walked through the door
Wait a minute
She was 'bout to drive me insane
She come with drama while I'm giving her chains
Wait a minute

He only wants me for my body, it's on now

Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute

Minding my business, I was doing my dance (Go, girl)
Got my attention, so I gave him a chance (Wait a minute)
Did I mention he was buying the bar? (Yes he did)
Gave him my number, he was trying so hard (Wait a minute)
Bought me some things I didn't want, didn't need (Yeah)
Droppin' his jeans like I'm supposed to drop to my knees (Wait a minute)
Now he been blowing up my phone like he know me (Oh, no)
Been leaving messages "You know what you owe me"
Oh, no

Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute
Girl, why you do me like that?
You take all my money, can't even call a player back
So wait a minute
Boy, why you tripping like that?
You think 'cause you tricking, you get it just like that?
Wait a minute

What is your problem, daddy?
Slow your roll
Who you think you jiving?
You're disturbing my flow (Wait a minute)
Why you be bugging like I'm some kinda hoe?
Got no more questions
Now I want you to go
So break (break)

Ba-da, b-b-ba-da
B-b-ba-da
B-b-ba-da

Hey, let me talk to you for a minute
Shut up, shut up
I love the way you strut
Girl, you already know
But, I'm feeling like you don't want me
You just after my dough
Baby, please, I'm fine
I'm not one of these hoes
Chasing dreams and diamond rings
So don't call me no more

Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey, oh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey, oh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?

See, I don't want your money
Yeah, I seen you rolling up here
In your Cadillac (Wait a minute)
But, I don't need all that
It is a nice color though
(Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?)
What they call you, Mr. Tin man or somethin'?
See, I don't want your cars
(Wait a minute, girl, why you do me like that?)
I don't want your jewelry
You can't buy this
So you can keep that (Wait a minute)
Wait a minute...
Uh, yeah, you can give me that back
 
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I go weak (I go so weak)
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Sway me, make me
Thrill me, hold me
Bend me, ease me
You have a way with me
(Hey, yeah) Sway me
Sway (sway, sway)
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I go weak
I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Sway me
Sway me
Sway me now
