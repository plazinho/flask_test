I’m through with standing in line to clubs I’ll never get in
It’s like the bottom of the ninth and I’m never gonna win
This life hasn’t turned out quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(Ah, so what you need?)
I’ll need a, a credit card that’s got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We’ll all stay skinny 'cause we just won’t eat
And we’ll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar, oh
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
(I’ll have the quesadilla, ha-ha)
I’m gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We’ll all stay skinny 'cause we just won’t eat
And we’ll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
And we’ll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today’s who’s who
They’ll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody’s got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I’m gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don’t get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We’ll all stay skinny 'cause we just won’t eat
And we’ll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we’ll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today’s who’s who
They’ll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody’s got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar, oh
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
 
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)
No, no
 
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me
 
This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left

'Cause you know
You know, you know

I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up

'Cause you know
You know, you know

I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore

So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long
So far away (So far away)
Been far away for far too long

But you know
You know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you (I love you)
I loved you all along
And I forgive you (I forgive you)
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, and never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me, never let me go

Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me, never let me go
 
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if, what if?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
 
I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in

You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
When she whispered "What was that?"
"The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are"
And that was when she started screamin'
"That's my dad outside the car!"
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)

So come on baby, get in
(We're just a couple of animals)
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
(We're just a couple of animals)
Get in, just get in
 
Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees, I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well, I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in

All I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
All I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story

Oh, I scream for you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And all I need from you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry, I'm fallin'

And all I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me (Hurry, I'm fallin')

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
 
Well, I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure you can take this anymore

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well, everybody's hit the bottom
Everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
Yeah, everybody's been abandoned
And left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hanging on

Just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
 
Addressing those beneath from high above
Convincing his belief for what you love
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Another charlatan to idolize

Is this suppression just in my mind? (Just in my mind?)
No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)

You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go

Is this obsession behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes?)
No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)

You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

Why must the blind always lead the blind?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why do I feel like the fault is mine?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why must the weakest be sacrificed?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
No more questions, get back in line!
(Just get back in line!)

Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away (Wither away)
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (To feed the machine)
To feed the machine
 
Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me
Oh
That shit makes me bat shit crazy
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out

We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
Ooh

We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me
Oh
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown

We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
Ooh

Tickin' like a time bomb, drinkin' till the nights gone
Well, get your hands off of this glass, last call my ass
Well, no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop
We got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out

We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going till the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
 
How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now

From underneath the trees
We watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight

Singing, Amen, I
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I
I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

And I'm singing
Amen, I, Amen, I
I'm alive
Amen, I, Amen, I, Amen, I
I'm alive

And in the air, the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing Amen, I
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I
I'm alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
When nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day when nobody died
 
Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body
They say it’s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene
If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on

Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along

(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
(You’re such a mover)
I love the way you dance with anybody
(The way you swing)
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth

Crafty little lip tricks
Tattoos on her left hip
She bending as you’re spending
There’s no end to it, so baby, come on
Dressed up like a princess
Betting that her skin smells better
Than the scent of every flower in the desert, come on

Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along

(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
(You’re such a mover)
I love the way you dance with anybody
(The way you swing)
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth

She loves the night scene bar queen
Living for the fun taking over every dance floor like she's the only one
In the spotlight all night dissing everyone
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb

(You’re so much cooler) When you never pull it out
(So much cuter) With something in your mouth

(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake your ass around for everyone
I love the way you dance with anybody
(The way you swing)
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
(You naughty thing)
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey
(You naughty woman)
You shake that ass around for everyone

I love the way you dance with anybody

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favourite damn disease

And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)

I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed
While you put me to the test
I like the white stains on your dress

And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self-respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
(Why not before? You never tried)
(Gone for good, and this is it)

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
(Why not before? You never tried)
(Gone for good, and this is it)
 
One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win

They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win

The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
Just like a heartbeat

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
 
Lying awake, did it again for Christ's sake
Shoulda told her to go, and I know it
But she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
I did what I did, can't say "hey man, I'm just a kid."
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it
Cause she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home

Oh
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home

The pain in my heart's 'cause we're a thousand miles apart
I've got no one to blame for the shame
'Cause she's waiting back home
I hope she's waiting back home
Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink
Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home
I hope there's someone back home

Oh
Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home

I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore
Must have known all along I was wrong
Cause there's no one at home
No one's waiting back home

Well, home ain't what I'd call it
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this liar
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home
 
One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Mama’s gonna let you set the moon on fire
Jack be nimble, jack be quick
Jack wound up with a broken neck
Humpty Dumpty, do your thing
Daddy’s gonna buy you a diamond ring

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale

Suzie steamboat, you’re so fine
Grant the wish I wish tonight
Tinker tailor, whatcha' got?
Wheels on the bus are falling off
Pretty maids all in a row
Yes, sir, yes, sir three bags full
Silver spoon at supper time
Four and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale

One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring where the sun don’t shine

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a goddamn fairy tale
Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you’ve never failed
Your life’s a fucking fairy tale
 
The first words that come out
And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I'm standing on

I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along

I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire

Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much

I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

I could set this song on fire
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
I wanna sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
 
This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know)
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

Nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Nobody wants to be the last one there (When you're looking for)
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ('Cause you never know)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (Make sure you're holding on)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
 
All your life, scramble and scurry
Take your time, rather than hurry
Never too late to write the best of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandon
The ticket to life as my mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely)

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older)

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

All mistakes, committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a debt that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)

Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Rain, yeah
Ra-ai-ai-ain
Gonna have to come after the rain
