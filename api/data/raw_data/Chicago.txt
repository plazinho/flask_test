You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul, baby

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see
So in love when we're together
Now I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
When you love somebody 'til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind
No one needs you more than I
When you love somebody 'til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind
I need you
 
Waiting for the break of day
Searching for something to say
Flashing lights against the sky
Giving up, I close my eyes

Sitting cross-legged on the floor
Twenty five or six to four

Staring blindly into space
Getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake
Wondering how much I can take

Should I try to do some more?
Twenty five or six to four
Oh yeah


Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day

Twenty five or six to four
Twenty five or six to four
 
"Everybody needs a little time away"
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
You're going to be the lucky one


(Get Away)
When we get there gonna jump in the air
No one'll see us because there's nobody there
After all, you know we really don't care
Hold on, I'm going to take you there
 
If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go

And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh girl, I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today


A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go

Ooh girl, I just got to have you by my side
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh mama, I just got to have your lovin'
 
When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing, I'm with you, that's all that matters
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Mmm, silent la la la la la
Never think of bad words to say

When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings
The color of chills all over my body
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Silent la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Silent

Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever, yeah
Oh no whoa
Yes, only the beginning of what I want to feel forever
Only the beginning, only just the start, yeah
I've got to get you into my life
Got to get you next to me, yeah
Only the beginning, only just the start

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Mm hmm mm mm mm


Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning

Only the beginning

As time goes on
I realize
Just what you mean
To me
And now
Now that you're near
Promise your love
That I've waited to share
And dreams
Of our moments together
Color my world
With hope of loving you

Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs

Eh Cumpari, ci vo sunari
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar
Singing for us all

Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children, all is not lost
All is not lost, oh no oh

Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July (Yes it is)
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, really touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all

If you want it, really want it
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day, yeah yeah yeah
 
Well my Daddy said I'm messy 'bout the whiskers on my chin
Never had no problems 'cause I've always paid the rent
I got no time for loving 'cause my time is all used up
I spend my time creating for some groovy kinds of love

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

If I had my choice of matter, I'd rather be content
Being closer to the chatter, showing where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how strong your love could be
'Cept for only sometimes groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so


If I had my choice of matter, I would rather be content
All engrossed in mental chatter, showin' where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how good your love can be
Resisting only some times groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
 
As I was walking down the street one day
A man came up to me and asked me
What the time was that was on my watch
Yeah... and I said

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

And I was walking down the street one day
A pretty lady looked at me
And said her diamond watch had stopped cold dead
And I said

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

And I was walking down the street one day
Being pushed and shoved by people
Trying to beat the clock, oh, no
I just don't know, I don't know, I don't know-oh
And I said... yes, I said
(Background:)
People runnin' everywhere
Don't know where to go
Don't know where I am
Can't see past the next step
Don't have time to think past the last one
Have no time to look around
Just run around, run around think why

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to die

Everybody's working
(I don't care) I don't care
(About time) About time
(Oh no, no) I don't care
