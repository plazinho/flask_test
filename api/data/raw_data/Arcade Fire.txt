In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still screaming
And running through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
That I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot, we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
I'm moving past the feeling
I'm moving past the feeling

In my dreams, we're still screaming
We're still screaming
We're still screaming
 
Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back

Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)

It’s a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
It’s just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
We all got things to hide
It’s just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
 
Take the makeup
Off your eyes
I've got to see you
Hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up
Comes the silence
I'm talking to you
You say you're over it
But I know
I thought I knew you
You thought you knew me
But now that you do
It's not so easy now
That I know

You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know that we know
Never know what we know

And all your makeup
Just take it all off
I've got to find you
Before the line is lost
I know I hurt you
I won't deny it
When I reach for you
You say, "I'm over it."
But I know

You can cry, I won’t go
You can scream, I won’t go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don’t know what I know
It’s so little that we know

But the cup it overflows
Little boys with their porno
But this is their world
Where can we go?
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Can you see me?

You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Little boys with their porno
Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong
It's the only world we know

Yeah, something's wrong
Little boys with their porno
And boys they learn
Some selfish shit
Until the girl
Won't put up with it
On and on and on we go
I just have to know
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
You say love is real
Like a disease
Come on tell me please
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
Wait
 
Afterlife, oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath, and the dirt, and the fires are burnt
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know

Can we work it out?
We scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?
Till we work it out, till we work it out
Till we work it out, till we work it out

Afterlife, I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It's like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know

Can we work it out?
We scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
We scream and shout till we work it out?

But you say, oh
When love is gone
Where does it go?
And you say, oh
When love is gone
Where does it go?
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

And after this
Can we last another night?
After all the bad advice
Had nothing at all to do with life
I've gotta know

Can we work it out?
We scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?

But you say, oh
When love is gone
Where does it go?
And you say, oh
When love is gone
Where does it go?
Oh, we know it's gone, but where did it go?
Oh, we know it's gone, but where did it go?
And where do we go?

Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo

Is this the afterlife?
It's just an afterlife
It's just an afterlife with you
It's just an afterlife
 
Something filled up
My heart with nothing
Someone told me not to cry
But now that I'm older
My heart's colder
And I can see that it's a lie

Children, wake up
Hold your mistake up
Before they turn the summer into dust
If the children don't grow up
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
We're just a million little gods causing rain storms
Turning every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust

With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am go-going
You better look out below!
 
Every inch of sky's got a star
And every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess that you've got everything now
And every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess that you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me
(Everything now!
Everything now!)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
And every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!
Everything now!)
Everything now

Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, like everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!
Everything now!)

'Til every room in my house
Is filled with shit I couldn't live without

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!
Everything now!)
Everything now

La, la, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la
Stop pretending, you've got

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!)

And every room in my house
Is filled with shit I couldn't live without

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!)
Every inch of space in my heart
Is filled with something I'll never start

The ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now
 
Some boys hate themselves
Spend their lives resenting their fathers
Some girls hate their bodies
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Saying God, make me famous
If You can't, just make it painless
Just make it painless

Assisted suicide
She dreams about dying all the time
She told me she came so close
Filled up the bathtub and put on our first record

God, make me famous
If You can't, just make it painless
Just make it painless

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)

Some girls hate themselves
Hide under the covers with sleeping pills and
Some girls cut themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback
Some boys get too much, too much love, too much touch
Some boys starve themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Creature comfort makes it painless
Bury me penniless and nameless
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't see it
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't touch it

Saying God, make me famous
If You can't, just make it painless
Just make it painless

It's not painless
She was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
And we're not nameless, oh

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
Well if you're not sure, better safe than sorry

Creature comfort, make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

We're the bones under your feet
The white lie of American prosperity
We wanna dance but we can't feel the beat
I'm a liar, don't doubt my sincerity

Just make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

Na-na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na-na-na
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
Creature comfort, make it painless
 
They're walking around, head full of sound
Acting like we don't exist
They walk in the room and stare right through you
Talking like we don't exist
But we exist
Daddy it's true, I'm different from you
But tell me why they treat me like this?
If you turned away, what would I say?
Not the first betrayed by a kiss

Maybe it's true, they're staring at you
When you walk in the room
Tell 'em it's fine, stare if you like
Just let us through, just let us through

They're down on their knees, begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Daddy it's fine, I'm used to 'em now
But tell me why they treat me like this?
It's cause we do it like this

Maybe it's true, they're staring at you
When you walk in the room
Tell 'em it's fine, stare if you like
Just let us through, just let us through

Let 'em stare, let 'em stare if that's all they can do!
But I'd lose my heart, if I turned away from you
Oh Daddy don't turn away, you know that I'm so scared
But will you watch me drown?
You know we're going nowhere
We know that we're young and no shit we're confused
But will you watch us drown, what are you so afraid to lose?

Down on my knees, begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
You're down on your knees, begging us please
Praying that we don't exist

But we exist, we exist
Down on your knees, begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
You're down on your knees, begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
But we exist, we exist
We exist, we exist
Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together, you can change us
Just where should you start?
 
And if the snow buries my
My neighborhood
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours
You climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle
The middle of the town
And since there's no one else around, we let our hair grow long
And forget all we used to know
Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow

You change all the lead, sleeping in my head
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn

Then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that...
The names we used to know
But sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms
And the bedrooms of our friends
Then we think of our parents, well, what ever happened to them?

You change all the lead, sleeping in my head to gold
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn
It’s the song I’ve been trying to sing

Purify the colors, purify my mind
Purify the colors, purify my mind
And spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine!
 
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose
But late at night, the feelings swim to the surface
'Cause on the surface, the city lights shine
They're calling at me, "Come and find your kind"

Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl

Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights!

We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
You shield my eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
Black River, your city lights shine
They're screaming at us, "We don't need your kind"

Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl

Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights!

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock

Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?

Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights
 
Hey, Orpheus!
I'm behind you
Don't turn around
I can find you
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I call for you
Oh, Orpheus!
Just sing for me all night
We'll wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
You say it's not me, it's you
Hey, Orpheus!
De l'autre côté de l'eau
Comme un écho
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I shout for you
Never doubt
Don't turn around too soon
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
It seems so important now
But you will get over
It seems so important now
But you will get over
And when you get over
When you get older
Then you will remember
Why it was so important then
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
When you get over
And when you get older
Then you will discover
That it's never over
Hey, Eurydice!
Can you see me?
I will sing your name
'Til you're sick of me
Just wait until it's over
Just wait until it's through
But if you call for me
This frozen sea
It melts beneath me
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
Now that it's over
Now that you're older
Then you will discover
That it's never over
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow
Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow
Cause it's never over
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
It's never over (it's never over)
We stood beside
A frozen sea
I saw you out
In front of me
Reflected light
A hollow moon
Oh Orpheus, Eurydice
It's over too soon
 
The businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "Can we still be friends?"

If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
Because it's better than being alone

If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying, "Please come out with us tonight"
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids at art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "Can we still be friends?"

If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
And now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Not sure you'll open the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready
