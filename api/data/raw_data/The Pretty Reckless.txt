Jimmy's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close you can hear him cry

Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
(Sing it) Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below

Judy's in the front seat picking up trash
Living on the dole, gotta make that cash
Won't be pretty, won't be sweet
She's just sitting here on her feet

Singing oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
(Go) Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
(Sing) Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've had better days, man
I've seen better days
I've had better ways, man
I know better ways

One, two, three and four
The devil's knocking at your door
Caught in the eye of a dead man's lie
Start your life with your head held high
Now you're on your knees with your head hung low
Big man tells you where to go
Tell them it's good, tell them okay
Don't do a goddamn thing they say

Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've seen better ways, man
I know better ways
I've seen better days, man
I've had better days

Gina's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close you can hear the crying

Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, heaven knows, we belong way down below
Oh Lord, tell us so, we belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below
 
Take me, I'm alive
Never was a girl with a wicked mind
But everything looks better
When the sun goes down

I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes, your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die

Taste me, drink my soul
Show me all the things that I shouldn't know
And there's a blue moon on the rise

I had everything
Opportunities for eternity
And I could belong to the night
Your eyes, your eyes
I can see in your eyes, your eyes
Everything in your eyes, your eyes

You make me wanna die
I'll never be good enough
You make me wanna die
And everything you love
Will burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes (I'm burning in the light)
You make me wanna die

I would die for you, my love, my love
I would lie for you, my love, my love (Make me wanna die)
And I would steal for you, my love, my love (Make me wanna die)
I would die for you, my love, my love

We'll burn up in the light
Every time I look inside your eyes (I'm burning in the light)
Look inside your eyes (I'm burning in the light)
I look inside your eyes
You make me wanna die
 
Part 1: The Walls Are Closing In

Get your shit together

There's no light
Mama, I can't see at all
There's no one left to break this fall
Mama, there's no one at all
Part 2: Hangman

Semi tabellio prima
Retracto quemadmodum callum
Odi cimussiato bora
Victum calefia doleo
Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama
Effascinatio crea
Tichius nova lumen patior
Esto mi doleo solor
Vivax olor ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inomina montis
I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah

I think I am gonna spend my last night here
I think I can finally see clear

When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul

Sono o no ma infecta
Estar in mia altaria
Estur inonima montis
I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah

Time flies by the rank of years
Humans die by the hand of fear

When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul

In the time of the light before humans had the sight
Spent my life living blind with a picture in my mind
A vision of the sun but now my life is done
As I wait for the light to come, I will take nothing
For what I would bring that won't decompose
As my body is disposed and the earth weights a ton
And now my life is done as I wait for the light to come

When they come to hang you
Stand straight, brace your neck, be strong, daughter
When they come to hang you
And you think you've lost control
Don't take—
And you think you've lost control
Don't take your soul

Mia esto nescienta
Lio rumen appello mama

I don't know, won't get out alive, yeah
 
Jenny died of suicide
With a candle burnin' in her eye
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll"
John forgot what he was on
But he broke the needle, dead and gone
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a woman on her back
I wanna go with balls, I won't pray
I wanna go with this bottle in my veins
I wanna go
I wanna go
I wanna go out my way

Amy shot and killed a man
With a gun too heavy in her hand
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""
Janey had steel in her bones
But she burned away, blood into stone
But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a woman on her back
I wanna go with this sickness in my throat
I wanna go, killed by rock and roll
I wanna
I wanna go
I wanna go out my way, yeah

I wanna go with a shotgun blast
I wanna go with a motorcycle crash
Out on my own, I don't need to be saved
I wanna go out my way

But on my tombstone when I go
Just put "Death by rock and roll""
 
Year one was lots of fun
But nothin' lasts forever in my dreams
And two, I followed you
Because you knew the way or so it seemed
And three, I still believed
That we would be becoming destiny
And four, I wanted more
But you were movin' on to better things

At twenty-five and still alive
Much longer than expected for a man
At twenty-five, all hope has died
And the glass of my intentions turns to sand
And shatters in my hand

Oh, oh, oh

Five to six, a lie, a kiss
The secrets that were served, we'd never say
Skip to eight, we called it fate
To live, to let us die another day
And nine, I saw the signs
Reflected in the barrel of a gun
Ten, we're here again
Those who loved me burned up in the sun

At twenty-five and still alive
Much longer than expected for a man
At twenty-five, all hope has died
And the glass of my intentions turns to sand
And shatters in my hand
Shatters in my hand

From eleven, twelve, I held the future in my grasp
And all through my teens, I screamed I may not live much past
Twenty-one, two, three, four
Twenty-one, two, three, four
Twenty-one, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

At twenty-five and still alive
Much longer than expected for a man
At twenty-five, all hope has died
And the glass of my intentions
The glass of my intentions
The glass of my intentions turns to sand
It shatters in my hand

Shatters in my hand
In my hand
 
Somewhere in the end of all this hate
There's a light ahead
That shines into this grave that's in the end of all this pain
In the night ahead there's a light upon this

House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

Somewhere in the end we're all insane
To think a light ahead can save us from this
Grave that's in the end of all this pain
In the night ahead there's a light up on this

House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

I am not afraid
I won't burn out in this place
My intention is to fade and I will, I will
In this

House on a hill
The dead are living still
With intentions to kill and they will, they will
Keep your children safe inside
Out of pocket, out of mind
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will
 
Father did you miss me?
I’ve been locked up a while
I got caught for what I did
But took it all in style
Laid to rest all my confessions I gave way back when
But now I’m versed in so much worse so I am back again
And he said…

For the lines that I take, I’m going to hell
For the love that I make, I’m going to hell
Getting heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells

Father did you miss me?
Don’t ask me where I’ve been
You know I know, yes I’ve been told
I redefine a sin
I don’t know what’s driving me to put this in my head
Maybe I wish I could die, maybe I am dead
And he said…

For the laughs that I fake, I’m going to hell
For the vows that I break, I’m going to hell
For the ways that I hurt while I’m hiking up my skirt
I am sitting on a throne while they’re buried in the dirt
For the man that I hate, I’m going to hell
Getting heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells

Please forgive me father
I didn’t mean to bother you
The devil’s in me father
He’s inside of everything I do

For the lives that I take, I’m going to hell
For the laws that I break, I’m going to hell
For the love that I hate, I’m going to hell
For the lies that I make, I’m going to hell
For the way I condescend and never lend a hand
My arrogance is making this head buried in the sand
For the souls I forsake, I’m going to hell
Married to the devil, you can hear the wedding bells
 
Here we are and I can't think from all the pills, hey
Start the car and take me home
Here we are and you're too drunk to hear a word I say
Start the car and take me home

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you, just tonight

Here I am and I can't seem to see straight
But I'm too numb to feel right now
And here I am watching the clock that's ticking away my time
I'm too numb to feel right now

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you, just tonight
Just tonight

Do you understand who I am? Do you wanna know?
Can you really see through me? Now I have got to go

But just tonight I won't leave
And I'll lie and you'll believe
Just tonight I will see
That it's all because of me

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you
Just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
 
Oh my god
Wish I was thin
Wish I was a normal human being
I'm just like them
Stuck in the dirt
I am a victim of my own self-worth

And now I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back to when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my god
Wish I was black
Wish I had soul when my music attached
I am so white
I shine like the sun
Just like with Eve count it down to the one

And I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back to when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my god
Wish I could think
Wish I could do something smarter than sing
But I'm just a face
Painted in mud
Don't try for perfect it's never enough

I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down
I'm just hanging with my head down

I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back
I wanna take it back to when I was so dumb and so innocent

Oh my god
Wish I was dead
Wish I could turn off the noise in my head
Oh my god, wish I could breathe
Enough air in my lungs to muster a scream
Oh my god, wish I was numb
The weight on my back didn't feel like a ton
Oh my god, wish I could pray
Believe in the words your religions all say
Oh my god, wish I could swim
Cause I'm gonna drown in depression again
 
Since I met you I've been crazy
Since I've been with you I've been lost
You make everything seem so hazy
Love comes with such a cost
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees

Nights avoiding things unholy
Your hand slips across my skin
I go down on you so slowly
Don't confess none of your sins
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees

When you're young you always take what you can get
Even bicycles and sprinklers get you wet
Now I know that there's a different way to die
My body breathes
Heart still beats
But I am not alive

Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees
Young love as sweet as can be
 
Been waitin' at these crossroads
Forever and a day
On a guy to buy my soul
I spend all night and day
How much harder can I play?
You know I gave my life to rock n' roll
Here we go

Mama begged me please
Yes, she got down on her knees
Said "you'll burn in that Mississippi sun"
But I'm the only one that's standing here
So mama don't you have no fear
I'm either last or I've already won
Here I go

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Standing at the crossroads
A dried up pen in hand
The conversation went like this
"Tell me your desire why you pulled me from the fire and we'll seal the deal with a kiss"
Said "I wanna raise the dead
Find a note that I can shred
On my walls I scrawl my gods
Don't care what happens when I die
As long as I'm alive
All I wanna do is rock, rock, rock"

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Oh, sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil)
Take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil, oh)
Won't you take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil)
(I got a record deal)
 
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine

Well, you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
And now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
You start to sweat so hold me tight ('cause)

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again

Well, I'll drink what you leak and I'll smoke what you sigh
See across the room with a look in your eye
Got a man to his left and a girl to his right
I start to sweat so hold me tight

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again

There's a tiger in the room and a baby in the closet
Pour another drink, mom, I don't even want it
Then I turn around and think I see someone that looks like you

Well, you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
And now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
You start to sweat so hold me tight ('cause)

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again, again
Again, again, again
Again, again, again

Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine
 
Ow!

I am strong, love is evil
It's a version of perversion that is only for the lucky people
Take your time and do with me what you will, I don't mind
You know I'm ill, you know I'm ill

So hit me like a man, and love me like a woman
Buried inside, look me in the eyes, I want it
One will give you hell, one will give you heaven
Hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Love me like a woman

Love is strong, but I am evil
You are wrong about me
Take your time, I'll play with me until
You can hear the children scream, like their stuck inside a dream
Then you'll know I will

So hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Bury me alive, I can see it in your eyes, you want it
Some will give you pain, some will give you pleasure
Hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Love me like a woman

Don't you run away, run away from me
I will run away from you
Don't you run away, run away from me
I will run away from you

Hit me like a man, love me like a woman
From the devil deep inside, can't you see what I'm wanting?
Some will give you hell, some will give you heaven
So hit me like a man, love me like a woman
Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman
Love me like a woman, ow!
 
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone

Let me open up the discussion with I'm not impressed with any motherfucking word I say
See I lied that I cried when he came inside and now I'm burning a highway to Hades
Shut the fuck up when I'm trying to think
I got to keep my concentration, give me one more drink
And then I'll try to remember all the advice that my good book told me
And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, someone get me out of the sun

Drugs, bars, backseats of cars, blowing boys, what a boring life I've led so far
Just a prime thirteen when I rode his machine
Tried to keep my body dirty and my eyes closed and clean
So with a wink and a smile and a vial of meth
I took his hand and we walked through the shadow of death
And then I try to remember all the advice that my teacher told me
And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, and get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun

Deep, deeper, deeper inside
Pull the wool nice and tight so that it covers your eyes
Can't find a God, a love, a Jesus, a father
I don't even care that much so why do I even bother?
So let me just end how I was gonna begin
Don't waste your time waiting cause I'm going back in
Now if I could just remember all the advice that my mother told me
And all the - and all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, just get me out of the sun
Kill me, just kill me, someone get me out of the sun
Kill me, just kill me, someone get me out of the sun
 
You don't want me, no
You don't need me
Like I want you, oh
Like I need you

And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life

You can't see me, no
Like I see you
I can't have you, no
Like you have me

And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

You can't feel me, no
Like I feel you
I can't steal you, no
Like you stole me

And I want you in my life
And I need you in my life

Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
 
I'm Miss Autonomy, Miss Nowhere
I'm at the bottom of me
Miss Androgyny, Miss Don't Care
What I've done to me
I am misused like I wanted to
Be not your slave
Misguided, high-minded
I'm missin' the train

And I don't know where I've been
And I don't know what I'm into
And I don't know what I've done to me

And as I watch you disappear into the ground
One mistake was that I never let you down
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
I'm Miss Nothing, I'm Miss Everything

I'm Miss Fortune, Miss So Soon
I'm like a bottle of pain
Miss Matter, you had her
Now she's going away
I'm Miss Used, Miss cunt-strewed
I don't need to be saved
Miss Slighted, high-minded
I’m stuck in the rain

And I don't know where I am
And I don't know what I'm into
And I don't know what I've done to me

And as I watch you disappear into the ground
One mistake was that I couldn't let you down
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
I'm Miss Nothing, I'm Miss Everything
I'm Miss Everything

And as I watch you disappear into my head
Well, there's a man who's telling me I might be dead
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
I'm Miss Nothing, I'm Miss Everything
 
And so it went
The children lost their minds
Beggin' for forgiveness
Was such a waste of time
And the bullets start to fly
And the bough's about to break
When you hear them cry
It's too much for me to take

They said the world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool
They said the world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to me

And so it went
The children lost their minds
Crawlin' over bodies of those who gave their lives
And the fists began to throw
And the fire starts to blaze
Don't you think they know
They're the fuckin' human race?

They said the world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool
They said the world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to—

Everyone is cryin' out, I can hear them scream
With all these eyes upon us, but no one seems to see
That you and me are just the same as God meant it to be
But you're much too close to me
You're much too close to me


And so it went
The children lost their minds
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
And the wind begins to howl
And the wolf is at your door
You have so much of everything
But still, you wanted more

They said the world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool
They said the world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to me

The world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool
They said the world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to me
 
Evil knocking at my door
Evil making me its whore
I don’t mind if you take what's yours but give me mine
Evil wants you to know
I'm much too young to be owned
I don’t mind if you take what's yours but give me mine

Hey there little girl
Come inside, I've got some sweet things
Put your hair in curls
Paint you up just like a drag queen

I don't mind decay
You are the knight that saves my day
Hey there little girl
Come inside, don't be afraid, I’ll keep you safe

I’m evil, knocking at your door
I'm evil, making you my whore
I don’t mind if you take what's yours but give me mine

Hey where are you going?
I wasn't through
I'm gonna have my way with you
Hey where are you going?
I wasn't through
I'm gonna have my way with you
Hey where are you going?
I wasn't through
I'm gonna have my way with you
Hey where are you going?
I wasn't through
I'm gonna have my way with you

I am like decay
I rot the ground that guides your way

Hey there little girl
Come inside, I've got some sweet things
Put your hair in curls
Paint you up just like a drag queen
How you like me now?
Did I succeed and make you proud?
Hey there little girl
Come inside, don't be afraid, I'll keep you safe
 
Alone, afraid, the kid your mother made
Sitting in your room drooling like a loser with all this doom
You think, and then you start to drink
Then you get so paranoid with all the drugs they fill you with

Then boom - does it make you feel like a man?
Boom - it's not the size, we understand
Boom - you think you're gonna get with me
You're never gonna get with me
You're never gonna dance with me

I admit, I feel like you, like shit
But I don't go round and take it out on everyone about it
We're all part of the system
You wanna start a war? You think that anyone would listen?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it
Wanna make a statement? You should've come without it

You turn the TV on, watch it if you dare
You see a politician and you start to pull your hair
But it's all two dimension, see there's really nothing there
You wanna tell them what you think, you think they fucking care?

And boom - do you think they hear you now?
And boom - making noises in the crowd
All in the way that you use it
You love it so much, then why do you abuse it?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it
Wanna make a statement? You should've come without it

We're all part of the system
Load em up, shoot em down, but you keep fucking missing
We're all part of the system
Load em up, shoot em down, but you keep fucking missing

Alone, afraid, you wanna make them pay…

That’s why you bring a shotgun to the party
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it
Wanna get the girl, then you should've come without it

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?
 
Back door bitches begging me to behold
All their cash and cars, platinum, silver and gold
We're like diamonds in the sky, that is what we are told
No mountain made of money can buy you a soul

Baby ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Coming down
And ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Coming down

It's a fucked up world, what do you get?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
A fucked up world, what do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette

Banging little boys bugging me on the bus
Say they wanna know who did it, but the answer's really us
See, I don't know you, why do you wanna know me?
You ain't getting what you want unless you're getting it for free

And baby ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Coming down
And ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Coming down

It's a fucked up world, what do you get?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
A fucked up world, what do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Oh yeah

Ooh
Back to these backdoor bitches begging me to behave
Jamming Jesus down my throat, no, I don't wanna be saved
Ain’t a chain on my brain, I’m nobody's slave
I got one foot in the cradle and one in the grave

It's a fucked up world
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Fucked up world, what do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette

It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world
