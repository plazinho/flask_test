Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher
 
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, ah-ah
I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you

With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you
 
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for


I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
 
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Alright, let's go!

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Come get some!

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your bloodshot eyes

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

And it's true, we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today, the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
Onâ€”

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
 
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

Nothing like love
There's nothing like love
Nobody like you
There's nobody like you


Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
 
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stoney ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day
 
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey

Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

Fight back
Don't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them
The master's lookin' for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said...

Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way


Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain
 
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take

I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone

And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out
 
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now, I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?
 
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain, yeah
Where the streets have no name, ah-ha

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
 
When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

I been crying out, "How bad can a good time be?"
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?

I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you can't see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly

You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?
 
Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
(Turn it up loud, captain)

Lights go down, it's dark, the jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart, a feeling so much stron-
-ger than a thought, your eyes are wide and though your soul
It can't be bought, your mind can wander

Hello, hello! (Â¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel
Feel

The night is full of holes as bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold, they twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll, they know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hello, hello! (Â¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
That you give me something
I can feel
Feel

Checkmated!
Just fun!
She made it in, yeah!
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt

Hello, hello! (Â¡Hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel
Kneel

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

You think itâ€™s easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think itâ€™s easier
To know your own tricks
Well, itâ€™s the hardest thing youâ€™ll ever do

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But youâ€™re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

You think itâ€™s easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think itâ€™s easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me then, and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But youâ€™re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control

God knows itâ€™s not easy
I'm taking on the shape of someone elseâ€™s pain
God, now you can see me
Iâ€™m naked and Iâ€™m not afraid, my bodyâ€™s
Sacred and Iâ€™m not ashamed

Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control (someone else is in control)
 
Yeah...

All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
On New Year's Day

I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says
Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again


Oh
Maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight

I will be with you again
I will be with you again

And so we're told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
 
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Are we tough enough
For ordinary love

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
 
If you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, yes I would
If I could, I would let it go
Surrender, dislocate
If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night, and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame
If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
Into the light and to the day
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake
I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, no
If you should ask, then maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Blue silken sky and burning flag
Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go
This desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation
Revelation, in temptation
Isolation, desolation
Let it go and so fade away
To let it go, oh yeah, and so fade away
To let it go, oh no, and so to fade away
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Wide awake, I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, no
 
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold

But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me
A highway with no-one on it
Treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night

You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold

All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You
 
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward

It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Look around, look around
Look around, it's a sound
Look around, look around
It's a sound

It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul

It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home

Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American

Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul
 
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt

I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We can hear you (hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (hear you, ooh)

I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
 
Morning, your toast, your tea and sugar
Read about the politician's lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why don't you
You dress in the colors of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else's suicide
You're gonna sleep like a  baby tonight

Dreams
It's a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there's no daylight, there's no healing

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

Hope, hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else's pain

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take flight
Like St. Francis covered in light
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
