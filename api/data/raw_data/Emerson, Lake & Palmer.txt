Cold and misty morning, I heard a warning borne in the air
About an age of power where no one had an hour to spare
Where the seeds have withered, silent children shivered in the cold
Now their faces captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold
I'll be there
I'll be there
I will be there
Suffering in silence, they've all been betrayed
They hurt them and they beat them, in a terrible way
Praying for survival at the end of the day
There is no compassion for those who stay
I'll be there!
I'll be there!
I will be there!
There must be someone who can set them free:
To take their sorrow from this odyssey
To help the helpless and the refugee
To protect what's left of humanity
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I'll be there!
I'll be there!
I will be there!
To heal their sorrow
To beg and borrow
Fight tomorrow!

Step inside, hello! We've a most amazing show!
You'll enjoy it all we know
Step inside! Step inside!
We've got thrills and shocks, supersonic fighting cocks!
Leave your hammers at the box
Come inside! Come inside!
Roll up! Roll up! Roll up!
See the show!
Left behind the bars, rows of Bishops' heads in jars
And a bomb inside a car
Spectacular! Spectacular!
If you follow me there's a speciality
Some tears for you to see
Misery, misery
Roll up! Roll up! Roll up!
See the show!
Next upon the bill in our House of Vaudeville
We've a stripper in a till
What a thrill! What a thrill!
And not content with that
With our hands behind our backs
We pull Jesus from a hat!
Get into that! Get into that!
Roll up! Roll up! Roll up!
See the show!

Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends
We're so glad you could attend, come inside, come inside
There behind a glass stands a real blade of grass
Be careful as you pass. Move along, move along
Come inside, the show's about to start!
Guaranteed to blow your head apart
Rest assured you'll get your money's worth
Greatest show in Heaven, Hell or Earth!
You've got to see the show. It's a dynamo!
You've got to see the show. It's rock and roll! Oh
Right before your eyes we pull laughter from the skies
And he laughs until he cries, then he dies, then he dies
Come inside, the show's about to start
Guaranteed to blow your head apart!
You've got to see the show. It's a dynamo!
You've got to see the show. It's rock and roll! Oh
Soon the Gypsy Queen in a glaze of vaseline
Will perform on guillotine! What a scene, what a scene
Next upon the stand will you please extend a hand
To Alexander's Ragtime Band, Dixieland, Dixieland!
Roll up, roll up, roll up!
See the show!
Performing on a stool we've a sight to make you drool
Seven virgins and a mule! Keep it cool, keep it cool
We would like it to be known the exhibits that were shown
Were exclusively our own. All our own, all our own
Come and see the show! Come and see the show!
Come and see the show!
See the show!

(Instrumental)

Man alone, born of stone
Will stamp the dust of time
His hands strike the flame of his soul;
Ties a rope to a tree and hangs the Universe
Until the winds of laughter blows cold
Fear that rattles in men's ears
And rears its hideous head!
Dread, death in the wind
Man of steel pray and kneel
With fever's blazing torch
Thrust in the face of the night;
Draws a blade of compassion
Kissed by countless kings
Whose jeweled trumpet words blind his sight
Walls that no man thought would fall
The altars of the just
Crushed, dust in the wind
No man yields who flies in my ship
DANGER!
Let the bridge computer speak
STRANGER!
LOAD YOUR PROGRAM. I AM YOURSELF
No computer stands in my way;
Only blood can cancel my pain
Guardians of a nuclear dawn!
Let the maps of war be drawn
Rejoice! Glory is ours!
Our young men have not died in vain
Their graves need no flowers;
The tapes have recorded their names!
I am all there is!
NEGATIVE! PRIMITIVE! LIMITED! I LET YOU LIVE
But I gave you life!
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO?
To do what was right!
I'M PERFECT. ARE YOU?
 
{Intro}

He had white horses
And ladies by the score
All dressed in satin
And waiting by the door

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was

White lace and feathers
They made up his bed
A gold covered mattress
On which he was laid

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was


He went to fight wars
For his country and his king
Of his honour and his glory
The people would sing

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was

A bullet had found him
His blood ran as he cried
No money could save him
So he laid down and he died

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was
 
Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
Have the days made you so unwise?
Realise, you are

Had you talked to the winds of time
Then you'd know how the waters rhyme
Taste of wine

How can you know where you've been?
In time, you'll see the sign
And realise your sin
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Will you know how the seed is sown?
All your time has been overgrown
Never known

Have you walked on the stones of years?
When you speak, is it you that hears?
Are your ears full? (full)
You can't hear anything at all



The preacher said a prayer
Save every single hair on his head
He's dead...
The minister of hate
Had just arrived too late to be spared
Who cared?
The weaver in the web that he made!

The pilgrim wandered in
Committing every sin that he could
So good...
The cardinal of grief
Was set in the belief he'd be saved
From the grave
The weaver in the web that he made!

The high priest took a blade
To bless the ones that prayed
And all obeyed
The messenger of fear
Is slowly growing, nearer to the time
A sign
The weaver in the web that he made!

A bishop rings a bell
A cloak of darkness fell across the ground
Without a sound!
The silent choir sing
And in their silence
Bring jaded sound
Harmonic ground
The weaver in the web that he made!



Clear the battlefield and let me see
All the profit from our victory
You talk of freedom, starving children fall
Are you deaf when you hear the season's call?

Were you there to watch the earth be scorched?
Did you stand beside the spectral torch?
Know the leaves of sorrow turned their face
Scattered on the ashes of disgrace

Every blade is sharp, the arrows fly
Where the victims of your armies lie
Where the blades of grass and arrows rain
Then there'd be no sorrow, be no pain
 
Show me the way to go home
I'm tired and I want to go to bed
I had a little drink about an hour ago
And it’s gone right to my head
Everywhere I roam
Over land or sea or foam
You can always hear me singing this song
Said show me the way to go home
Show me the way to go home
I'm tired and I want to go to bed
I had a little drink about an hour ago
And it’s gone right to my head
Everywhere that I roam
Over land or sea or foam
You can always hear me singing this song
Show me the way to go home
Show me, show me
Show me the road that leads home
Show me, show me
Show me the way to go home
Everywhere that I roam
Over land or sea or foam
You can always hear me singing this song
Said show me, show me the way, to go home
 
There might have been things I missed
But don't be unkind
It don't mean I'm blind
Perhaps there's a thing or two
I think of, lying in bed
I shouldn't have said
But there it is

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here
From the beginning

Maybe I might've changed
And not been so cruel
Not been such a fool
Whatever was done is done
I just can't recall
It doesn't matter at all

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here
From the beginning
 
I've tried to mend
The love that ended
Long ago although we still pretend
Our love is surely coming to an end
Don't waste the time you've got to love again
We tried to lie
But you and I
Know better than to let each other lie
The thought of lying to you makes me cry
Counting up the time that's passed us by
I've sent this letter hoping it will reach your hand
And if it does I hope that you will understand
That I must leave in a while
And though I smile
You know the smile is only there to hide
What I'm really feeling deep inside
Just a face where I can hang my pride
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
We'll talk of places that we went
And times that we have spent
Together penniless and free
You'll see the day another way
And they could put the sunshine
For a nighttime where you lay
You'll love again I don't know when
But if you do I know that
You'll be happy in the end
 
And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the Holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my Chariot of Fire!
I will not cease from mental fight
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land
 
Welcome back, my friends
To the show that never ends
We're so glad you could attend!
Come inside! Come inside!

There behind a glass
Stands a real blade of grass
Be careful as you pass
Move along! Move along!

Come inside, the show's about to start
Guaranteed to blow your head apart
Rest assured you'll get your money's worth
The greatest show in Heaven, Hell, or Earth

You've got to see the show, it's a dynamo
You've got to see the show, it's rock and roll

Right before your eyes
We'll pull laughter from the skies
And he laughs until he cries
Then he dies, then he dies

Come inside, the show's about to start
Guaranteed to blow your head apart

You've got to see the show, it's a dynamo
You've got to see the show, it's rock and roll


Soon the Gypsy Queen
In a glaze of Vaseline
Will perform on guillotine
What a scene! What a scene!
Next upon the stand
Will you please extend a hand
To Alexander's Ragtime Band
Dixieland, Dixieland

Roll up! Roll up! Roll up!
See the show!

Performing on a stool
We've a sight to make you drool
Seven virgins and a mule
Keep it cool, keep it cool
We would like it to be known
The exhibits that were shown
Were exclusively our own
All our own, all our own

Come and see the show!
Come and see the show!
Come and see the show!
See the show!

See the shoooowwwwwww!
 
Do you wanna be an angel
Do you wanna be a star
Do you wanna play some magic
On my guitar
Do you wanna be a poet
Do you wanna be my string
You could be anything
Do you wanna be the lover of another undercover
You could even be the
Man on the moon
Do you wanna be the player
Do you wanna be the string
Let me tell you something
It just don't mean a thing

You see it really doesn't matter
When you're buried in disguise
By the dark glass on your eyes
Though your flesh has crystallised
Still...you turn me on (oh yeah)
Still...you turn me on (ooh)
Mmm...you turn me on

Do you wanna be the pillow
Where I lay my head
Do you wanna be the feathers
Lying in my bed
Do you wanna be the cover
Of a magazine
Create a scene
Every day a little sadder
A little madder
Someone get me a ladder
Do you wanna be the singer
Do you wanna be the song
Let me tell you something
You just couldn't be more wrong

You see I really have to tell you
That it all gets so intense
From my experience
It just doesn't seem to make sense
Still...you turn me on (oh yeah)
Mmm...you turn me on (ooh yeah)
Mmm...you turn me on
 
Just take a pebble and cast it to the sea
Then watch the ripples that unfold into me
My face spills so gently into your eyes
Disturbing the waters of our lives
Shreds of our memories are lying on your grass
Wounded words of laughter are graveyards of the past
Photographs are grey and torn, scattered in your fields
Letters of your memories are not real
Wear sadness on your shoulders like a worn-out overcoat
In pockets creased and tattered hang the rags of your hopes
The daybreak is your midnight, the colours have all died
Disturbing the waters of our lives
Of our lives
Of our lives, lives, lives
Of our lives
