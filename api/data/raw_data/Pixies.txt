Ooh—stop

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah (Yeah)
Your head will collapse, and there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
Bumped into me, I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse, and there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
 
Hey
Been trying to meet you
Hey, must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at the door, whore in my bed
But hey
Where have you
Been?
If you go, I will surely die

"Uh!"
Said the man to the lady, mm-hm
"Uh!" Said the lady to the man she adored
And the whores like a choir
Go "Uh!" all night
And Mary, ain't you tired of this?
"Uh!" is the sound
That the mother makes when the baby breaks

Got me a movie, I want you to know
Slicing up eyeballs, I want you to know
Girlie so groovy, I want you to know
Don't know about you

But I am un chien andalusia

Outside there's a boxcar waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait till face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the boxcar waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Big shake on the boxcar moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Ay-yeah
Ay-yeah
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man

There was a god
An under water god who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge
From New York and New Jersey

This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven

The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole
Now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
And if the ground's not cold, everything is gonna burn
We'll all take turns, I'll get mine too

This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven

Rock me, Joe

If Man is five, If Man is five
If Man is five, then the Devil is six
Then the Devil is six, the Devil is six
The Devil is six, and if the Devil is six
Then God is seven, then God is seven
Then God is seven

This monkey's gone to Heaven

And this I know, his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips she said
She said

Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball

Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love

Lovely legs, they're a...
What a big black mess, what a hunk of love
He'd walk her every day into a shady place
He's like the dark, but I'd want him

Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball

Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
A big, big love, a big, big love
 
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead, but I sail away

On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave

I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Niño
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave
 
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm, mhm, mhm, hm
Hm-hm, mhm, hm

Missy aggravation
Some sacred questions
You stroke my locks
Some marijuana if you got some

Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
La, la
Oh, oh

Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms
You spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers

Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm

Chained to the pillars
A 3-day party
I break the walls
And kill us all with holy fingers

Gouge away (La la)
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
 
This is a song for Carol!

You're into Japanese fast food
And I dropped off your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That tastes a bit like everyone
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine

I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda, he bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep yep, yep!

I make you pray, you make me hard
Your island skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine

Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

Your bone's got a little machine
 
Put this down for the record
It’s more or less un-checkered
Wasted days and wasted nights
Made me a fucking beggar
No soul, my milk is curdled
I’m the burgermeister of purgatory
Look out for that hot plate
Guess that’s all you got, great
You put the cock in cocktail, man
Well I put the tail in WAIT!
Watch me walk
Blowtorch a hole in the armor
And I don’t need the tip

I am in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I’m the one who’s got some trotters
You’ve many mouths to feed

Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me

Just to be sure that you’re a sap

Crap is their operative
Locomotive of the longest death

There goes Indie Cindy whose
Sails were black when it was windy
We offed ourselves in a lover’s pact
We threw ourselves into the sea
Well looksie what the wind washed back
As we follow the bouncing ball
They call this dance the washed up crawl

I am in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I’m the one who’s got some trotters
You’ve many mouths to feed

Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright

What's that floating in the water?
Ol' Neptuna's only daughter
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe in Mr. Grieves

Do you have another opinion? (Yup!)
Do you have another opinion?

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Got bombed, got frozen
Got finally off to finally dozing
I believe in Mr. Grieves

Do you have another opinion? (Yup! Opinion!)
Do you have another opinion?
Do you have another opinion?

You can cry, you can mope
But can you swing from a good rope?
Oh, I believe in Mr. Grieves

Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
 
Got hips like Cinderella
Must be having a good shame
Talking sweet about nothing
Cookie, I think you're

Tame, tame
Tame, tame

I'm making good friends with you
When you're shaking your good frame
Fall on your face in those bad shoes
Lying there like you're

Tame, tame

As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile, it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed

I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes

I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

There's a place in the buried west
In a cave with a house in it
In the clay, the holes of hands
You can place a hand in hand

I bleed (I bleed)
I bleed (I bleed)
I bleed (I bleed)
 
Shake your butt!

Estaba pensando sobreviviendo con mi sister en New Jersey
Ella me dijo que es una vida buena allá
Bien rica bien chévere
Y voy!
Puñeta!

We'll keep well-bred, we'll stay well-fed
We'll have all sons, they will be all well hung
They'll come and play, their friends will say
Your daddy's rich, your mamma's a pretty thing

That maid Maria, she's really OK
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Vamos a jugar por la playa

Ay! Muñeca cabrona! Maricona! Cabrona!

If we get bored we'll move to California
They'll come and play, their friends will say
Your daddy's rich, your mamma's a pretty thing

That maid Maria, she's really OK
Vamos a jugar por la playa
