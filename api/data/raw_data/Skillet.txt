The secret side of me I never let you see
I keep it caged but I can't control it
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls
It comes awake and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

My secret side I keep hid under lock and key
I keep it caged but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out, he'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end!

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

It's hiding in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream
Or maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I’m gonna lose control, it’s something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
 
Target on my back
Lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sights
No surrender no
Trigger fingers go
Living the dangerous life

Hey, hey, hey

I'm trying to get up, they're knocking me down
Chewing me up, spitting me out

Every day we choose
We might win or lose
This is the dangerous life

Hey, hey, hey
Everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone; they say that they've won
The bell has been rung, it's over and done
Hey, hey, hey
When I need to be saved
They counting me out, but this is my round
You in my corner, look at me now
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium

I feel, I feel it
Invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible
 
(I) am a nation, (I) am a million faces
Formed together, made for elevation
(I) am a soldier, (I) won't surrender
Faith is like a fire that never burns to embers
(Who's gonna stand up, who's gonna fight?)
The voice of the unheard
(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?)
Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
The voice of the unheard
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us
 
I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
Losin' my faith today, we're fallin' off the edge today
I am just a man, not superhuman
I'm not superhuman, someone save me from the hate
It's just another war, just another family torn
We're falling from my faith today
Just a step from the edge
Just another day in the world we live

I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero! Save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me just in time!

I've gotta fight today to live another day
Speakin' my mind today, my voice will be heard today
I've gotta make a stand, but I am just a man
I'm not superhuman, my voice will be heard today
It's just another war, just another family torn
My voice will be heard today
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves

I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero! Save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me just in time!

I need a hero to save my life!
I need a hero just in time!
Save me just in time!
Save me just in time!

Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
We're in the fight of our lives
And we're not ready to die
Who's gonna fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero (I've got a hero) livin' in me!
I've gotta fight for what's right
Today, I'm speakin' my mind
And if it kills me tonight
I will be ready to die
A hero's not afraid to give his life
A hero's gonna save me just in time

I need a hero to save me now!
I need a hero! Save me now!
I need a hero to save my life!
A hero will save me just in time!

I need a hero!
Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
I need a hero!
Who's gonna fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero, I need a hero!
A hero's gonna save me just in time

Cold and black inside this coffin

I hate feeling like this
I'm so tired of trying to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of is waking to you
Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missing
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losing you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

I hate living without you
Dead wrong to ever doubt you
But my demons lay in waiting
Tempting me away
Oh, how I adore you
Oh, how I thirst for you
Oh, how I need you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

Breathing life
Waking up
My eyes open up

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

Oh, how I adore you
Waking up to you never felt so real
Oh, how I thirst for you
Waking up to you never felt so real
Oh, how I adore you, oh
The way you make me feel
Waking up to you never felt so real
 
You spoke a word and life began
Told oceans where to start and where to end
You set in motion time and space
But still you come and you call to me by name
But still you come and you call to me by name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from your sight
I get so lost, forget my way
But still you love and you don't forget my name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?
Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
(Lifting up my heart)
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

You're the one who holds the stars
 
(Legendary)
Oh!
(Legendary)
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh

My heart bleeds adrenaline
The fire I breathe is where I live
Say my name, incredible
Say my name, an animal
One life to live
I never give up, I never give in

Some people wanna turn and run
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (I'm never falling)
Destiny is callin' me, go down in history
Every day, I'll fight to be legendary

Oh!
Oh, oh, oh
Oh!
Oh, oh
Legendary

Fly high or will I fall?
Legends made when faith is strong
Say my name, no time to plead
Say my name, I'm conquering
While I'm alive, I'll push through the pain, I'll run for the prize

Some people wanna turn and run
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (I'm never falling)
Destiny is callin' me, go down in history
Every day, I'll fight to be legendary
Oh, oh, oh
Every day, I'll fight to be legendary

Oh!
Oh, oh, oh
Oh!
Oh, oh
Legendary


Wings are made to fly, made to fly
Fears are born to die, born to die
Pushin' through the pain, through the pain
Pushin' through, breakin' through
Whatever it takes, what I gotta do
Givin' my all, givin' all that I've got
Never will stop 'til I get to the top

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (I'm never falling)
Destiny is callin' me, go down in history
Every day, I'll fight to be legendary
Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Oh, oh, oh
Still the one that's standin' now (I'm never falling)
Oh, oh, oh
Destiny is callin' me, go down in history
Oh, oh, oh
Every day I'll fight to be legendary
Oh, oh
Legendary

Oh!
Oh, oh, oh
Oh!
Oh, oh
Legendary
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Death surrounds
My heartbeat’s slowing down
I won’t take this world’s abuse
I won’t give up, I refuse
This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled
They can’t keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

Don’t you give up on me
You’re everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back


No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

No, we're not gonna die tonight
Not gonna die
Not gonna die
Not gonna die
Not gonna die
Not gonna die tonight
 
Despite the lies that you're making
Your love is mine for the taking
My love is just waiting
To turn your tears to roses

Despite the lies that you're making
Your love is mine for the taking
My love is just waiting
To turn your tears to roses
I will be the one that's gonna hold you
I will be the one that you run to
My love is a burning, consuming fire

No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
You know I'm never far
Hear my whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark

You feel so lonely and ragged
You lay here broken and naked
My love is just waiting
To clothe you in crimson roses
I will be the one that's gonna find you
I will be the one that's gonna guide you
My love is a burning, consuming fire

No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
You know I'm never far
Hear the whispers in the dark


No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
No, you'll never be alone
When darkness comes
You know I'm never far
Hear the whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
 
All I see is shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in a world we made
Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!
Rise, rise

Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb
And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And the light shines on a brave new day

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution
Unite and fight to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, we rise

Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise!
Rise, rise

In a world gone mad
In a place so sad
Sometimes it's crazy, crazy
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up, no
If you wanna keep what you love!
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Keep what you love
Never give up, no

Rise
Rise in revolution
Rise
Rise in revolution
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight, we rise
Make a better life
Tonight, we rise!

Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise, rise, rise and revolution
Rise


 911?
 There's a guy here with a gun!
 Ma'am? Ma'am?
 Kids, get under the table! Kids get under the table!!!
 We are getting new reports from all around the globe, showing the highest unemployment rates since the end of World War II. Many are losing their jobs, their homes, and in many cases, their hope
 You are such a failure! What is wrong with you? You can't do anything right! I wish you had never been born!
 
I hear 'em talk to me
But they're not listening
Their words are kerosene
They don't know who I am
They'd never understand
What it's like to be me
I don't wanna be here
So stuck inside
Tell me how long have I been here?
I'm losing track of time

In all this loneliness and all this emptiness
Been stuck inside this room like a prison sentence
I'm not gonna stay, tell me there's a way

High above it all (Above it all)
Victorious, victorious
Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
In hopelessness, I'm over this
Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
I can face it all (Face it all)
Victorious, victorious

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Can't change this overnight
Though Heaven knows I've tried
Here I go again
I need a savior now
Someone to break me out
Who's been the place I've been
Don't wanna be forgotten
When I'm dead and gone
I just wanna be the one who
Got up and came back strong

High above it all (Above it all)
Victorious, victorious
Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
In hopelessness, I'm over this
Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
I can face it all (Face it all)
Victorious, victorious

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Help me 'cause I'm falling
When I can't sleep, but I'm holding on
Can't face this night alone

In all this loneliness and all this emptiness
Been stuck inside this room like a prison sentence
I'm not gonna stay
Tell me there's a way

High above it all (Above it all)
Victorious, victorious
Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
In hopelessness, I'm over this
Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
I can face it all (Face it all)
Victorious, victorious

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
