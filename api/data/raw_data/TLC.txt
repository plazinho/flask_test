A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me"
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too
Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things to keep you happy?
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me (Heyeah)

My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so

Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh I oh I oh I yeah

The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'
'Cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there, so was I
In the park, Fourth of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on, so I am

Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gon' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relation-ships

I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Oh why do I feel the way I do? (Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you?
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?
Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you
And I am diggin' the scene

Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me

What, what about your friends?
What about
What about your friends?
What about your
What about your
What about your

Every now and then, I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then, I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again? (Woah)

Yeah, yeah (What about your friends?)
Even though I might be easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'
Yo, if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and...
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
So it ain't like I'm braggin', just join the paddywagon, 'cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Screamin' loud and holdin' sheets
Scared that you'll be called a freak
Gotta let it go while you can
Ain't 2 proud 2 beg, you see
'Cause my man belongs 2 me
And I know that he understands

I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait 4 so long?
'Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Yo, Left Eye, kick that shit!

Realize the realism of reality treats us both the same
'Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain, it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words, let's refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' da waterbed
Yeah, I like it when you (Mwah!)
Both sets of lips
Oooh, on the TLC tip!
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (I ain't 2 proud 2 beg)
What I call my own (I ain't 2 proud )
Just you and me (Uh)
Heyyy
I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud to beg

I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait 4 so long?
'Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much, see, 'cause

This goes out to forever
Through sunshine or the rainiest weather
And no matter what it will always be us together (TLC)

I said if I got nothin' else
I got memories of what we felt
I sit up laughing to myself
Sometimes, about it
Those silly reasons we would fight
But no matter who was wrong or right
We were always right there
Sharing this love, sharing this life

Cause we knew
Said we always knew
That no matter what would occur
That we were
Meant to be (Ayyy)

And it ain't gonna be easy (Ayyy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (Ayyy)
And we ain’t never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be
And though, it'll get dark sometimes we know
Every now and then it's got to rain
But when that rain starts to pound
All you gotta do is turn around
And you'll find me right there
Holding you up, holding you down

Cause we knew (Cause we knew)
Said we always knew
That no matter what would occur
That we were
Meant to be (Ayyy)

And it ain't gonna be easy (Ayyy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (Ayyy)
And we ain’t never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

From the moment we met
Meant to be
Through the sorrow, through the stress
Meant to be through life and through death
Hey, we've built a love that nothing can test
Meant to be, yeah
And it ain't gonna be easy (Said, it won't be easy, no)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (Meant to be, yeah)
And we ain’t never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be, yeah
And it ain't gonna be easy (Said, it ain't gonna be easy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (We were, we were)
And we ain’t never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it ain't gonna be easy (Said, it ain't gonna be easy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (We were, we were)
And we ain’t never not known that
We were always meant to be (Always)
Meant to be

Always
Meant to be
Yeah, haha13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
