Yeah
Take me to the truth
Take me home with you
Change my taste in music (I'm fallen)
Make me rise with you (She likes you)
I'm surprised you do

Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
In my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Your vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

I'm surprised you do (Baby)
I won't lie to you (I love you)
I'm your guy who's new
Hide me from the blue
I'm dying on the moon, and I just needed you

Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, OMG, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a 100 thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa
Spend some time with you
I might bend the rules
'Cause I'm in love with you
You can't see the truth
I will show you soon
Just meet me on the moon

She said, "Love is a strong word", said love is a strong word?
Well I'ma sing it for you baby, I'll be your songbird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Heard a brother just got shot because he stepped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your songbird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I love you too
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
I will see you soon
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
Your homework is due
SYRE, do you remember?
What's the difference from the future and the past?
Just seen Batman, Lex Luthor
Drag racing in the Jag-uar
Started floating through the valley
Of the city of the angel scraping cash
Now I'm bleeding on the people
I forget that I still got an open gash
I'm the realest kid you never had, baby
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

Why do I cry at night still?
Can't sleep without the NyQuil
Stressed out because we fight
Will we ever get this right?

'Cause thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man (no more)
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand (so lay me)

So lay me down in Eden under stars
And show me why it's us that he will choose (take me home, take me home)
If happy, I would die here in your arms
Don't cry because the ocean makes me blue
So blue, so blue

So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue
(Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze)
Well lately baby, I don't give a fuck
I'm sick of kissing up, I used to miss us taking pics and kissing
Now you miss the club, I pull my zipper up
Start to think "Wait, is this it for us?"—Nah
'Cause I fell for you
See I'm the living Icarus, relationships they suck
I'm lookin' around and girl what happened to me?
(What happened? What happened? What happened?)
They hate on me now but soon I'll be winning
And plaque after plaque, you will see it
And they mad at my accuracy
But my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat
Better pass it to the chief, world is tragic and deceased
Cops selling crack in the street
But you look like the law
I know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start
Baby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard
When I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars, it's my—

I knew that there would come a day, when you would wanna
You-you would wanna, you-you would wanna run away
Take you to a sunny place
Girl, follow me into the ocean56EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
“Love.”
"The United States—and the White House—smile!"

Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

When I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
Isn't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue (Blue)
You sit in your room and you listen to tunes
And I'm feeling embarrassed, it's true
You out there in Paris with who?
When I open my eyes (Eyes), I wish to see you (You)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through (House), there's a seat just for you (You)
My prettiest secret, I hope that you keep it
I'm blue as a piece of the moon, and I know I'll be seeing you soon
She said "Jaden, you are my soulmate” (You are my soul)
You only say that when you're lonely (When you’re lonely)
Girl, I'm surprised you even know me, ay
I'm not gon' fuck, but we can kick it like we homies, ay
'Cause we just homies, baby

Life is a puzzle, it isn't picture perfect
You could miss perfection in it because it is subtle
The storm is coming and it's raining cats and dogs
Stay away from all them puddles
I'm keepin' it humble and noble
I spit that radiation like I’m Chernobyl
On Indus Valley, man, I'm in the valley
Crying myself to sleep on the sofa (When you're lonely)
I told ya I'm more than the kid with a chauffeur
Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now
The MSFTS'll stay on the up and up, I'm tryna hold it down
They stay attacking us, I'ma just weep on my willow
I look what they saying, they playing as I go to sleep on my pillow
But then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
This ain't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue (Blue)
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through, got a seat just for you
Girl, and whether you do, I invited you so
Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

You need to stand for something or else you'll fall for nothing
Girl, this not my country, we all come from Africa
Now we’re onto something, girl, you're hella grumpy
I think you're just hungry, cause right now you're acting up
I don't think you want me, you just want my company
While your man is —ing all these girls who laugh at us
Girl, you got me running from you, I want nothing
Cloudy days aren't sunny
Girl, you make me wanna dance, dance, dance
You put me in a trance, you never wanna hold hands
But I guess I just missed the chance
Miss one text, she gets pi—

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna know (Oh)
You could be my bride, you could let me come inside
You could be my home (Oh)
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna go
But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rolling
(—live a lie, I don't wanna know)
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
(—inside, you could be my home)
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna know

But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone

Rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling
Baby girl, you got me rolling
Damn, out of your control when
I touch your body in the ocean
Then you feel these raw emotions
(Then you feel these raw emotions)
Syre
Passion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone, Syre

I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We traveled too far from home
Baby, we don’t need a hero
I have never been a hero
Your love always been a zero
Baby, you should be the hero
Baby, you should be the hero

Legend says Syre still exists in the mist, in the fog
Poets say he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Look at the case, close it
Open the doors, look at my neck
Look at my wrist frozen
Look at my pants dripping
Swag, know that you stole it

Play this shit in the club for m— uh
If you in there, uh
Nigga, I'm ghost42EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Yeah, yeah

Batman, Batman, Batman
Joker just put me on acid
Huh, you on the wave like a Maverick
You need to make something happen
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please put me on new fashion
Huh, I ain't learn nothing since last year
You got the renegade fabrics
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please put me up on a Tesla (Skrrt!)
I'm tryna be hella extra
Please hand-me-down a new sweatshirt
Batman, Batman, Batman
Heard that you ain't got a mattress
Heard that you king of Manhattan (Queens)
So why you stay in the 'Basas?
Batman, Batman, Batman
We need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war
Watch out, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman
I heard you married a Porsche
That shit is all in the past, plus we got very divorced
You ain't ready for the war, Skywalker with the force
One, two, three, four, D'artiste is making noise
In the suburbs with the boys, on a roll, no Royce
Had to save the day every single way, we don't really got a choice
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please save the day from the demons
I was sleep and he was leaning
We drove right into a precinct
Batman, Batman, Batman
Why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell
But this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman
So fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help

Shooting up on Skid Row, out your window
Look and you could tell
Get it from under their spell
If I don't do it, then who else?
Need me to shoot up the signal
I'll be there to get the info
Skrrtin' through the residential (Skrrt!)
I wish it wasn't plain and simple
Lemme pull up to the party, need like 35 credentials

Batman, Batman, Batman
Why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell
But this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman
We need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war
Hold up, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman
So fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help
Batman, Batman, Batman
That was not part of the deal
You was protecting the bank and then you walked off with a mil'43EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was tryin' to love you but we

Heart is broken, heart is broken
Gettin' green, gettin' green
Man I'm artichokin', man I'm artichokin'
I can't breathe, that's the art of chokin'
That's the, that's the art of chokin' (woo!)
Send a text, I never opened it
You thought I read this shit? Well I was jokin'
Falling down like I'm in Autumn
All you jokers spitting nada, nada, nada
Six minutes and I still gotta mind my muh'fuckin' problem
Calm down, calm down
Hm, hm, hm, hm, now we're still here
Thank you

Try me, come try me
I wish you could see what I see
I'm late, you find me so timely
I'm lost, baby, come and find me
Girl, I'm fallin' to the ground and you'll never get me up
I'm just a baby with a stack of needles and a sippy cup
And this shit sucks, need some love, my Aphrodite I can touch
Elvis Presley's coming out of me, my head has got a rush
Didn't pick a fight, the FBI just picked a fight with me
Man I cry at night, like every night, just come right here and see
Screw your V.I.P, we are like Adam and Eve, we are like Adam and Eve
We are like Adam and Eve, oh no, what happened to me? No
Jimi Hendrix with the flex
On the Ford motor, rollin', gettin' checks
At your crib for the chill
Who is at the door? Are you finna check, check, check?
Man, you better show respect
Man, I let her go, we both know I had her
Man, I'm madder than a hatter
Played my heart and now I'm swagger than Mick Jagger
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, I told 'em
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the check, check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check (you were my love)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits (you were mine)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix, better check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits (you watch me breathe)
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

You were my love, you were my love
Don't let you in my life
Don't be rude to us
Sorry don't be rude to us

You're no good for me girl, you're cruel and infectious
You are my wish, this is me with a death wish
I'm smart, I should get this but, your eyes, your hips, your lips
To me they're so precious, I guard them like treasures
I'd run, I'd drive, I'd fly distant measures just to witness your gestures
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
(I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I'm crying to sleep, girl, I'm crying to sleep)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(I'll die by the sea, girl, I'll die by the sea)
Will you die with me, girl? Will you die with me?
The future I see, girl, will you try to see?22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I could put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
You're pretty as the ocean
I'm coming with the gang
So you need to get out our way
The ladies love it when I sing
The niggas love my abilities
When I make the fire on the beats
I'm about to make a mil' a week
When I hit 'em with the melodies
I don't care what you tellin' me
Tryna stay away from felonies, oh

Girl, I'm Martin Luther, Martin Luther King
Life is hard, I'm Kamasutra-ing
I'm runnin' through the pain that the youth has been
Inflicted with, it's just ridiculous that you would kill a kid for some Yeezy's
Grab your shoes and give his mom a visit at the funeral, you lookin' fly as hell
Is that really how we're living? Check it
Got a vivid dream of some different (tell 'em)
K. Dot is comin' out of me, the poetry you know it's been a minute
Forefathers put the tax on our real fathers
I don't feel represented, I should be up in the Senate
Swear I feel like Martin Luther, baby, we need Adam Foss prosecutor so they won't
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand my niggas to the prisons
Forgiveness over your permission
Just because I didn't break it I'ma fix it
And I'm with my dawgs, I'm finna sic ‘em
Teachers said I need a lesson
So I go and start my own school
And it's a mystery to you, you get it?
Misdemeanor's comin' true it ain't the question
But it ain't a problem, they gon' catch you
That's the mind state of the youth including me
We need some new professors
Were you goin' fast son? Yes, sir
It was that autopilot on the Tesla
Heart palpitating so my chest hurts
Probably see it through my sweatshirt, yellin
Mama, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Paint the pedal just so I could go impress 'em
Almost got us on the stretcher
And I'm sorry mama, know you taught me better
You know, you know you taught me better
Father, I don't need a lecture
Man, I know the street is rougher for the texture
And I'm saying
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm the mess-up
I just use these 808's to do confessions
I'm double cursing and I'm flexing
Vile person, Man I feel like I’m in prison
This isn't me, it's my reflection
My purities need protection from the insecurities of a section of my soul
I just put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Don't follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same
I just put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Don't follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out of my conscious, out of my conscious in my room

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit the candle, I lit the candle in my room
It's all lost
Cigarette smoke spark in the dark, ash
Baby girl I worry about you, you never talk
And, I guess that's the way I am
I guess that's the way I am

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle

Oh boy you're lost now
Voices in your head gone now
I heard you and so-and-so had a falling out
What was that about?
Something happened then she shot him down
Just be happy that she not around
Boy you not a hero, you a problem child
What type of fire have you started now?
That was all your homies, that was not a crowd
Always walking round, head up in the clouds
Keep me humble baby, sit me down
So lost (so lost)
Sit alone in my room waiting for the dark (for the dark)
Cigarette smoke lights, see the sparks (see the sparks)
I seek your soul
I'm trapped in my room (trapped in my room)
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I'm all alone
Why can't you just call my phone? (I have a question)
I'm here girl, just come on home
My secrets, you will never know (You will never know)
Why are you so incredible? (Why are you so incredible?)
Why can't I be eligible? (Why can't I be eligible?)
Did I skip you cause I'm telling untold?
And I'll go

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy
I don't look outside, no I don't at all
Loving is after us, I hear there's a love for us
I know there's a love for us, I know you're on to shit
I know you're by yourself
I know there's a love for us, for all our accomplishments
This is beyond our sin, I do not want this shit
I was a lost boy, I do not got a choice
I couldn't live alone, all I got is my voice
We couldn't conversate, you didn't wanna talk
I don't wanna fight with you, just wanna spend the night with you
Syre died in the sunset, don't be like him
Man that's where the story ends, but it also begins
He's building pyramids, he's getting serious
Until he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this
This ain't an outer body conversation about conspiracists
Even though I may appear as this, see Syre grew a tear in his eye
Because the summer’s too bright for his spirit in the night
There’s a python in the pyramids
Look, this is for the kids feeling lost
Sleep on the street, eating the moss
I don’t got no more teeth in my jaws
Cause I ripped them out, I’m sick of killing innocents at large
This is for the kids feeling lost
MSFTS got you at all costs
