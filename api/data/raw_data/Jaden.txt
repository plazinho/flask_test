Yeah
Take me to the truth
Take me home with you
Change my taste in music (I'm fallen)
Make me rise with you (She likes you)
I'm surprised you do

Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
In my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Your vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

I'm surprised you do (Baby)
I won't lie to you (I love you)
I'm your guy who's new
Hide me from the blue
I'm dying on the moon, and I just needed you

Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, OMG, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a 100 thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa

Spend some time with you
I might bend the rules
'Cause I'm in love with you
You can't see the truth
I will show you soon
Just meet me on the moon

She said, "Love is a strong word", said love is a strong word?
Well I'ma sing it for you baby, I'll be your songbird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Heard a brother just got shot because he stepped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your songbird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I love you too
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
I will see you soon
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
Your homework is due

SYRE, do you remember?
What's the difference from the future and the past?
Just seen Batman, Lex Luthor
Drag racing in the Jag-uar
Started floating through the valley
Of the city of the angel scraping cash
Now I'm bleeding on the people
I forget that I still got an open gash
I'm the realest kid you never had, baby
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
 
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

Why do I cry at night still?
Can't sleep without the NyQuil
Stressed out because we fight
Will we ever get this right?

'Cause thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man (no more)
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand (so lay me)

So lay me down in Eden under stars
And show me why it's us that he will choose (take me home, take me home)
If happy, I would die here in your arms
Don't cry because the ocean makes me blue
So blue, so blue

So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue
(Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze)

Well lately baby, I don't give a fuck
I'm sick of kissing up, I used to miss us taking pics and kissing
Now you miss the club, I pull my zipper up
Start to think "Wait, is this it for us?"—Nah
'Cause I fell for you
See I'm the living Icarus, relationships they suck
I'm lookin' around and girl what happened to me?
(What happened? What happened? What happened?)
They hate on me now but soon I'll be winning
And plaque after plaque, you will see it
And they mad at my accuracy
But my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat
Better pass it to the chief, world is tragic and deceased
Cops selling crack in the street
But you look like the law
I know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start
Baby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard
When I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars, it's my—

I knew that there would come a day, when you would wanna
You-you would wanna, you-you would wanna run away
Take you to a sunny place
Girl, follow me into the ocean
 
“Love.”
"The United States—and the White House—smile!"

Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

When I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
Isn't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue (Blue)
You sit in your room and you listen to tunes
And I'm feeling embarrassed, it's true
You out there in Paris with who?
When I open my eyes (Eyes), I wish to see you (You)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through (House), there's a seat just for you (You)
My prettiest secret, I hope that you keep it
I'm blue as a piece of the moon, and I know I'll be seeing you soon

She said "Jaden, you are my soulmate” (You are my soul)
You only say that when you're lonely (When you’re lonely)
Girl, I'm surprised you even know me, ay
I'm not gon' fuck, but we can kick it like we homies, ay
'Cause we just homies, baby

Life is a puzzle, it isn't picture perfect
You could miss perfection in it because it is subtle
The storm is coming and it's raining cats and dogs
Stay away from all them puddles
I'm keepin' it humble and noble
I spit that radiation like I’m Chernobyl
On Indus Valley, man, I'm in the valley
Crying myself to sleep on the sofa (When you're lonely)
I told ya I'm more than the kid with a chauffeur
Who don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now
The world's a lot colder now
The MSFTS'll stay on the up and up, I'm tryna hold it down
They stay attacking us, I'ma just weep on my willow
I look what they saying, they playing as I go to sleep on my pillow
But then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you (Love)
But your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time (Time)
Well, I guess you're somewhere with your crew (Crew)
This ain't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue (Blue)
I'm at the SOHO House
If you wanna come through, got a seat just for you
Girl, and whether you do, I invited you so

Come here, mama, I know you want me
Food from the soul, I know you're hungry
Gave you my two cents, ain't got money, but
I'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey
It's something funny, baby

You need to stand for something or else you'll fall for nothing
Girl, this not my country, we all come from Africa
Now we’re onto something, girl, you're hella grumpy
I think you're just hungry, cause right now you're acting up
I don't think you want me, you just want my company
While your man is —ing all these girls who laugh at us
Girl, you got me running from you, I want nothing
Cloudy days aren't sunny
Girl, you make me wanna dance, dance, dance
You put me in a trance, you never wanna hold hands
But I guess I just missed the chance
Miss one text, she gets pi—
(Fuck this, not recording anymore)

Sometimes I feel like a stone
Sometimes I'm feeling like (I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a stone
Sometimes I'm feeling like (I'm rolling)

Sometimes I'm riding a wave (I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star
Sometimes I feel like a (I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star
Sometimes I feel like a (I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star
Sometimes I feel like a (I'm rolling)
Sometimes I feel like a star
Sometimes I feel like a (I'm rolling)

Yeah, sometimes I feel like a star (I'm rolling)
Star, sometimes I feel like a star, yeah

Saying that we'll run away
(All night and day)
I doubt that we'll ever go
(All night and day)
I hope the sunset will stay
(All night and day)
We've traveled too far from home
(All night and day)
Saying that we'll run away
(All night and day)
I doubt that we'll ever go
(All night and day)

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna know (Oh)
You could be my bride, you could let me come inside
You could be my home (Oh)
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna go
But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rolling
(—live a lie, I don't wanna know)
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
(—inside, you could be my home)
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna fantasize
I don't wanna know
(Baby, you could run away)
But baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets
When I'm all alone
Baby girl, you know I'm rolling
(Baby, you could run away)
Get you without any clothes, I'm focused
(Baby, you could run away)
Our love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless
(Baby, you could run away)
(You could run away)
Rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling
Baby girl, you got me rolling
Damn, out of your control when
I touch your body in the ocean
Then you feel these raw emotions
(Then you feel these raw emotions)

Syre
Passion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'
What you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo
Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road
Lost, broken, invisible
But when that light gets low, he's invincible
So much soul that he redefined inevitable
So it'll never go
So the sun never set at all instead of setting slow
And as the legend goes Syre lived forever on
And never and forever alone, Syre

I'm rolling, I'm rolling
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
Saying that we'll run away
I doubt that we'll ever go
I hope the sunset will stay
We traveled too far from home
Baby, we don’t need a hero
I have never been a hero
Your love always been a zero
Baby, you should be the hero
Baby, you should be the hero

Legend says Syre still exists in the mist, in the fog
Poets say he ascended to the Gods
Skeptics say he pretended to be gone
But I say that he's eternally lost

Sorry, honest, you need to hear my side of the story
Let's talk, get low to highs, let 'em off
Sit at home, reading Vogue with a centerfold
Love is simple, it's all good 'til the crescendo
'Til they wake up and switch, we ain't playin' Nintendo
That's why when the sun sets I just stare at the window

Summertime is meant to fall in love

Batman, Batman, Batman

That shit is all in the past, plus we got very divorced
You ain't ready for the war, Skywalker with the force
One, two, three, four, D'artiste is making noise
In the suburbs with the boys, on a roll, no Royce
Had to save the day every single way, we don't really got a choice
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please save the day from the demons
I was sleep and he was leaning
We drove right into a precinct

Batman, Batman, Batman
Why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell
But this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman
So fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help

Shooting up on Skid Row, out your window
Look and you could tell
Get it from under their spell
If I don't do it, then who else?
Need me to shoot up the signal
I'll be there to get the info
Skrrtin' through the residential (Skrrt!)
I wish it wasn't plain and simple
Lemme pull up to the party, need like 35 credentials

Batman, Batman, Batman
Why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell
But this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman
We need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war
Hold up, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman
So fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help

That's the, that's the art of chokin' (woo!)
Send a text, I never opened it

Falling down like I'm in Autumn
All you jokers spitting nada, nada, nada
Six minutes and I still gotta mind my muh'fuckin' problem
Calm down, calm down

Hm, hm, hm, hm, now we're still here
Thank you

Try me, come try me
I wish you could see what I see
I'm late, you find me so timely
I'm lost, baby, come and find me
Girl, I'm fallin' to the ground and you'll never get me up
I'm just a baby with a stack of needles and a sippy cup
And this shit sucks, need some love, my Aphrodite I can touch
Elvis Presley's coming out of me, my head has got a rush
Didn't pick a fight, the FBI just picked a fight with me
Man I cry at night, like every night, just come right here and see
Screw your V.I.P, we are like Adam and Eve, we are like Adam and Eve
We are like Adam and Eve, oh no, what happened to me? No
Jimi Hendrix with the flex
On the Ford motor, rollin', gettin' checks
At your crib for the chill
Who is at the door? Are you finna check, check, check?
Man, you better show respect
Man, I let her go, we both know I had her
Man, I'm madder than a hatter
Played my heart and now I'm swagger than Mick Jagger

Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, I told 'em
Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Jimi Hendrix with the check, check, check, check
Jimi Hendrix with the shits, chaos, chaos

Jimi Hendrix with the shits
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos

You were my love, you were my love
Don't let you in my life
Don't be rude to us
Sorry don't be rude to us

You're no good for me girl, you're cruel and infectious
You are my wish, this is me with a death wish
I'm smart, I should get this but, your eyes, your hips, your lips
To me they're so precious, I guard them like treasures
I'd run, I'd drive, I'd fly distant measures just to witness your gestures
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
Never forever (still flying), the moments still hold us together
(I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I don't believe, girl, I don't believe)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(That you wanna be, girl, somewhere not with me
I'm crying to sleep, girl, I'm crying to sleep)
Never forever, the moments still hold us together
(I'll die by the sea, girl, I'll die by the sea)
Will you die with me, girl? Will you die with me?
The future I see, girl, will you try to see?
 
I could put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
You're pretty as the ocean
I'm coming with the gang
So you need to get out our way
The ladies love it when I sing
The niggas love my abilities
When I make the fire on the beats
I'm about to make a mil' a week
When I hit 'em with the melodies
I don't care what you tellin' me
Tryna stay away from felonies, oh

Girl, I'm Martin Luther, Martin Luther King
Life is hard, I'm Kamasutra-ing
I'm runnin' through the pain that the youth has been
Inflicted with, it's just ridiculous that you would kill a kid for some Yeezy's
Grab your shoes and give his mom a visit at the funeral, you lookin' fly as hell
Is that really how we're living? Check it
Got a vivid dream of some different (tell 'em)
K. Dot is comin' out of me, the poetry you know it's been a minute
Forefathers put the tax on our real fathers
I don't feel represented, I should be up in the Senate
Swear I feel like Martin Luther, baby, we need Adam Foss prosecutor so they won't
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand my niggas to the prisons
Forgiveness over your permission
Just because I didn't break it I'ma fix it
And I'm with my dawgs, I'm finna sic ‘em
Teachers said I need a lesson
So I go and start my own school
And it's a mystery to you, you get it?
Misdemeanor's comin' true it ain't the question
But it ain't a problem, they gon' catch you
That's the mind state of the youth including me
We need some new professors
Were you goin' fast son? Yes, sir
It was that autopilot on the Tesla
Heart palpitating so my chest hurts
Probably see it through my sweatshirt, yellin
Mama, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Paint the pedal just so I could go impress 'em
Almost got us on the stretcher
And I'm sorry mama, know you taught me better
You know, you know you taught me better
Father, I don't need a lecture
Man, I know the street is rougher for the texture
And I'm saying
Sorry, mama, I'm a mess-up
Sorry, mama, I'm the mess-up
I just use these 808's to do confessions
I'm double cursing and I'm flexing
Vile person, Man I feel like I’m in prison
This isn't me, it's my reflection
My purities need protection from the insecurities of a section of my soul

I just put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Don't follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same
I just put you on a wave
I just put you on a wave
Don't follow me into the ocean
You will never be the same
 
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit a candle, I lit a candle in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out of my conscious, out of my conscious in my room

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle on my own
I lit the candle, I lit the candle in my room

It's all lost
Cigarette smoke spark in the dark, ash
Baby girl I worry about you, you never talk
And, I guess that's the way I am
I guess that's the way I am

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know
You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
Out in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room
I was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room
Too much to handle, too much to handle

Oh boy you're lost now
Voices in your head gone now
I heard you and so-and-so had a falling out
What was that about?
Something happened then she shot him down
Just be happy that she not around
Boy you not a hero, you a problem child
What type of fire have you started now?
That was all your homies, that was not a crowd
Always walking round, head up in the clouds
Keep me humble baby, sit me down
So lost (so lost)
Sit alone in my room waiting for the dark (for the dark)
Cigarette smoke lights, see the sparks (see the sparks)
I seek your soul
I'm trapped in my room (trapped in my room)

You're all alone
Does she love you? You'll never know
I’ll love her ‘til forever on
'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know

I'm all alone
Why can't you just call my phone? (I have a question)
I'm here girl, just come on home
My secrets, you will never know (You will never know)
Why are you so incredible? (Why are you so incredible?)
Why can't I be eligible? (Why can't I be eligible?)
Did I skip you cause I'm telling untold?
And I'll go

I was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room
I'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy
I don't look outside, no I don't at all
Loving is after us, I hear there's a love for us
I know there's a love for us, I know you're on to shit
I know you're by yourself
I know there's a love for us, for all our accomplishments
This is beyond our sin, I do not want this shit
I was a lost boy, I do not got a choice
I couldn't live alone, all I got is my voice
We couldn't conversate, you didn't wanna talk
I don't wanna fight with you, just wanna spend the night with you

Syre died in the sunset, don't be like him
Man that's where the story ends, but it also begins
He's building pyramids, he's getting serious
Until he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this
This ain't an outer body conversation about conspiracists
Even though I may appear as this, see Syre grew a tear in his eye
Because the summer’s too bright for his spirit in the night
There’s a python in the pyramids
Look, this is for the kids feeling lost
Sleep on the street, eating the moss
I don’t got no more teeth in my jaws
Cause I ripped them out, I’m sick of killing innocents at large
This is for the kids feeling lost

It's always been more than the music
Now they looking at my new 'fit
Rockin' Couture on the floor of a Louis V store
And I'm sorry I'm stupid
Riding to Metro, we boomin' (yuh)
All the MSFTS come together in a Tesla
And we zooming
Annunaki going stupid
Psilocybin, feeling lucid
It's always been more than the music
Off to Saturn in a cruise ship
Now I'm snapping like a toothpick...

The older you get the worse it gets I guess
Oh my God, that shit's so annoying
Tuh! Odessa, I'm constantly on the phone with you
Literally constantly on the phone with you
Yo, can I play you something really quick?
Yo, can I play you—
You're all here and this shit possible, exactly
Look, look, exactly, so, I told her that
You're suppose to usher it in
That's what I'm 'bout to say
That's what I'm saying yo'
He's gotta you see the vision
That's what I'm saying, bro
Even when shit is...
Why am I paying this verse if they don't value it as much
Not even for those reasons that I told you earlier
You know, you know... not to play devil's advocate
But at the same time it's kinda
Difficult to get your money in cash when you're just so big
Yo, Flacko— Flacko, let me play you something


Yeah, ooh, this one's for all of my renegades
Plan B, sippin' lemonade, skrt on the beat like a centipede
(Skrt, skrt, skrt) Yeah, squad fuck with us heavily
Wack shit, I got a remedy, blow up like a couple of enemies
Sideline with a felony
On the move like a melody, I don't care what you telling me
I don't do nothing fugazi
'Til I tell you we amazing, I will be their everything
They're a piece of shh, I'm a royal flush
MSFTS in the building, you should know what's up, what's up, what's up
You call me on the phone so don't you blow me up
Yeah, hah, whole squad blowin' up, yeah

Breaking news there is a band of renegades
Teenagers in north Los Angeles, Calabasas area
Throwing paint, art pieces, blasting their new albums
There has been a triple homicide by a man named Syre
So, you think you can save rap music?
 
So I dream in color
I found Eve sleeping with another
Take my hand, but don't pull me under

Cause if I fall for you, it's gon' be trouble
And if I fall for you, there's gon' be trouble

Girl I'm wondering, I'm just wondering
Is it just me or would you
Do the same thing to another kid?
Girl, I understand if a heart is never broken
Where the hell the fun in it?
Got my shooters with me when I run in it
Would you relax, girl? We just taking pics
You know I run with the intelligence
Man I swear the city hate the melanin
Just how I hate the weapons that they sellin' 'em
And I don't care what they tellin' now
I be sonning jokers, I got hella kids
Fucking with the clique and you a skeleton
Put a case around my heart, Pelican
Got a couple secrets I don't tell my friends
Started walking slow and then I fell again
Like why, all these knives started falling from the sky?
Man, I’m doubting I’ll survive
Why you trying to turn me into your guy?
Baby, I'm just tryna catch your vibe

Cause if I fall for you, it's gon' be trouble
And if I fall for you, there's gon' be trouble

Girl I'm wondering, I'm just wondering
Is it just me or would you do
The same thing to another kid?
Girl, I understand if a heart is never broken
Where the hell the fun in it?
Got my shooters with me when I run in it
Would you relax, girl? We just taking pics
So you know I hated our relationship
And girl you know I run with the intelligence
Swear the city hate the watermelon and the melanin
Girl, your heart is open so I fell in it
I'ma follow the rules then rebel again
As soon as I can get a whiff of freedom
All these girls you know I never need 'em
Huh, know you think I'm so conceited
My innocence will never be defeated
Huh, lately I'm running from demons
Been having trouble since I was a fetus (Jaden!)
My heart is tatted with the scripture, my chest is hurting
Girl, I'm just a bishop, had a problem listening the father figures
Now I'm on a wave, hope that God is with us
But I've calmed, calmed down
Not as vicious, I'm just glad I got a kitchen pot to piss in
If I didn't, that would mean I blew my riches
Screw these other girls, girl I know I'm trippin'
Girl, you know I'm trippin' on you
I think you picked the wrong dude
All eyes on me, slippin', fall through it all
You don't know what I'm going through
The saddest shit is so true, that's why my soul is so blue

Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib, an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand
Falling down, we falling down, we falling down
Falling down, we falling down, we falling down

(He falling down, he's so beautiful, he'll fall)
He doesn't know where he is, he's so confused
He won't wake up (why not?) He can't remember
Damn I forgot (she killed him)
He doesn't remember (he died before)
So where is she? (He doesn't remember)
(Can you hear me?) Yeah, I can
I've been sleeping (Come back to us)
(Where is he?) Right here (Syre, she loved you)
(Give us the album) Your wake up call's coming
 
Yeah!
Oh shit (woo!)
Look, uh-huh

Sometimes I feel like a Polaroid picture
Trapped inside space and time, take a sip of my elixir, ay
Play "Electric Love" while we riding in the Fisker, ay
She fell in love with me, my G, I swear I never kissed her, ay
Lead me to be free, I don't have time to be a mister, ay
Baby, I'll be blunt with you, I won't be smoking swishers
I just do a couple dishes then I wish you Merry Christmas
Adios, made that body roll, you scream "Geronimo"
Blow some kisses to some mistresses, they fall like dominos
Dominos, dominos, baby girl, I gotta go
I just talked to Billboard Records, they said I'm phenomenal
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I'm phenomenal
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I'm phenomenal
Ah, ah, that's it, that's all I got right now

Yeah, my name is George Jefferson, the male Maleficent
You don't know who you're messing with, I ran for president
'Cause our country is in a deficit, my only testament
Is that we keep it so surreal, I'd kill myself to resurrect, hoo
(I'll kill myself to resurrect)

You know she know I'm the man
I got her number on the Gram, I would never understand
Kick it with Rich the Kid, I just woke up with the bands
30 South and we in France
I just woke up, I'm in Cannes, never let 'em have a chance
Huh, cheetah print is on the pants
Expelliarmus, me and Harry Potter in the Benz
Nobody look at my dab, run around skrtin', they mad
Louis just gave me a bag, how did he end up with that?
And nobody look at my dab, now I'm runnin' with the RAF
Living in and out of cabs (skrtt, got 'em)
"Uh, baby boy what's your name?" I thought you'd never ask

Yeah, my name is George Jefferson, the male Maleficent
You don't know who you're messing with, I ran for president
Cause our country is in a deficit, my only testament
Is that we keep it so surreal, I'd kill myself to resurrect, hoo

Kill myself to resurrect, ay
Kill myself to resurrect, ay
(Jaden, Mom is on the phone for you)
I was, I was just on the phone with her
(Jaden, Dad is on the phone for you)
Let's go

Huh, super-psychedelic sleeping isn't new to me
I tried to sleep it off to deal with everybody's scrutinies
Baby call me Willy Wonka, on my Oompa Loompa steez
Man I'll only whipped the Tesla but I'll cop the coupe and screech (skrt)
 
Mmm
The sun is goin'
The sun is goin'
The sun is goin' down

The city late at night, hit a pinnacle
Shinin' on 'em, I rather trip alone
Put those on game, who didn't know the true form
Of pure evil, so visible, so I keep a lot of vision
Every night I try to read your mind and see what's in your eyes
Or that we catch a vibe, we're wastin' time
'Cause all I ever know is

In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, caught off and I'm floatin' by
In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, let's go up
Baby, yeah we can go up
Feelin' just don't stop it now
Niggas tryna hate on us (Mm-mm)
Ain't worry 'bout a thang
Since I'm strong enough
The feelin' just don't stop it now
Baby, yeah we can go up (Mm)
Baby, yeah we can go up (Yeah)

I see the light in you, stay strong
The moon will follow you back home
Since I've seen space, it's been too long
That's why I stargaze in my room
Let the dust settle on Venus
We ran off with diamonds
The media mislead us
True wealth is knowledge
They gon' try to hold you down
But we gon get back up right now
They gon' try to mute this sound
But just know that you got that power

In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, caught off and I'm floatin' by
In the zone, in this life, arms open wide
In the zone, let's go up
Baby, yeah we can go up
Feelin' just don't stop it now
Niggas tryna hate on us (Mm-mm)
Ain't worry 'bout a thang
Since I'm strong enough
The feelin' just don't stop it now
Baby, yeah we can go up (Mm)
Baby, yeah we can go up

I found Eden, between the Euphrates and the Tigris
I'm not dreamin', smokin' J's on the Nile
This is why, why we came
Think I'm done with the hybrids
I don't like how they speakin'
They just talkin' about us (Talkin' 'bout us)
ERYS

I seen Cudi in a mall (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Them kicks go hard (Them kicks go hard)
Chain disco ball (Like disco ball)
Throw someone in the stars
Whole different Galaxy on my Atari
They tryna copy my walk
Handcuff, wrist rock
I don't listen when they talk, 'cause I heard enough
Woah, I wish, I wish, I wish
I could get a hundred mil' for the wrist
I wish I could get that highrise on my deck
Wish I didn't have to hide it when I walk, and ****
I wish, I wish, I wish that I didn't have to flex like this
I wish that I was a paramedic with the whip
I wish that I'd always bein' honest with the drug problem
I wish, I wish I'm thinking 'bout you when I'm dying like this
I'm thinking 'bout you and a girl like this, oh
 
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this

Can't find me up, up, and away
I give a fuck 'bout your wave
My nigga, I surf every day
Drownin' my soul in the basement, ayy
I ain't got much in the bank
I got a lot I could say
Caught up with goddesses, hey
I hope you forgive my mistakes
Yeah, run around with the renegades
You should take a seat, save your energy
I try to heal the gash with a band-aid
In the time of need, you call your enemies
I landed in Ibiza and I need a visa
I ain't playin' with you, this no Mamma Mia
Need a Hottie-tottie with a body, yeah
I just spit the knowledge then I'm out of here

(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town, well we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hundred thousand?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down

I stumbled the cool
I'm awesome, kickflip in the Kostons
We should run for the pool
I got the fire flow, the department exhausted
I owe nothing to you
I'm in the Tahoe, man you making me nauseous
Pullin up with the crew
You such a hypebeast, man
You making me vomit, look—

Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
It's always been more than the music
You riding waves in the back of my cruise ship
Look, watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it, my nigga, you foolish

(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town, well we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hundred thousand?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down

Look, look, look
This shit is out of here
You got the heat I was not aware
BNBB out in Rotterdam
Got a new man, damn now I see him
He on the floor, in my colosseum
I hope to god he don't sign a prenup
See my ex on the street like I never seen her!

Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
You see me dancing like I'm Elvis
Just tell your man that it's all in the pelvis
Look, watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it, my nigga, you foolish

(Yeah!) That's what they yell when we come around
(Yeah!) This is your town, well we run it now
(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hundred thousand?
(Yeah!) If you want the rain then we comin' down
 
Done with reminiscin'
Spittin' fire hotter than the pot up in the kitchen, yuh
And lately I've been itchin' to take a rapper on
'Cause I'm really done with all the sneak disses, yuh
My whip is fully electric
You need a lesson just to whip it, ay, ay
I'm on the other side havin' way too good a time
Baby, why you still trippin', yuh?
Probably 'cause I'm sippin' penicillin
'Cause I'm so sick, Joker, I'm just chillin' like a villain, yuh
Couldn't think of any better feelin', no
I hope you trip when I whip out the flow, yuh
She got the ice, I can tell, watch when I slip on the snow, oh
Gas, goin' fast to my destination, I ain't worried 'bout traffic (No)

Look, are we in Colorado (Wait) or at Mardi Gras?
Girl you party hard, I'm a genie in a bottle, ay, wishin' for all and all
Get the motorcycle, hit the throttle, watch me hit them guitar notes
I just need me a model, reincarnation's the motto

(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion

Skinny Young Jiggy in your city, yuh (Yo)
Huh, I say I wanna battle and you say you too dizzy, no
You just don't want to mess with the finessin'
I get it, they said you stressin', keep you living
I hope you know that I been spitting since I turned seven
If you're a ship, I'm 'bout to wreck it, I told you
Look, skinny Young Jiggy in your city, yuh
I don't talk to you, I'ma talk to my bruhs, uh
Go to Philly, say hello to my cousin, uh
You talking all that mess, I know you don't want it, yuh
Hey, skinny Young Jiggy in the city, yuh
Hey, ay, be my baby girl, you hella pretty, yuh, yuh, yuh
Motocross down the street to this beat
I'm popping a wheelie (Skrt!)
Hey, keep my family closer than these jokers
Don't make me go to Philly
I told you, I'm bodying all you
I'm not gonna hold you, shout-out to Whole Foods
Them jokers are old news
You know it's lit when they don't notice you
I'm 'bout to matte the Tesla
And I shed a bullet for my MSFTS soldiers who I owe it to
The FDA is all on me, you know it's true
The clique is rolling and I'm on the move

(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion
(Nah, nah, nah) The passion

Look, are we in Colorado (Wait) or at Mardi Gras?
Girl you party hard, I'm a genie in a bottle, ay, wishin' for all and all
Get the motorcycle, hit the throttle, watch me hit them guitar notes
I just need me a model, reincarnation's the motto
Yeah, look

(Syre, don't do this)
I don't wanna cry, I just want to get you out of my mind
(Don't open up to him)
Open your eyes, I been by your side through all of this time
(Don't tell him anything)
Excuse the disguise for all the magic that is hitting my mind
We're living a lie
Open your eyes, I been by your side through all of this time
Through all of them guys, through all of them lies
(I love you more) Ooh, help us
Something is new, tell us
Talking to you, selfish
I do not want to die
Ooh, help us
Something is new, tell us
Talking to you, selfish
I do not want to die
 
Doin' what we ain't 'posed to, girl, that's why I chose you
I don't want to impose, just listen close to my poems
Girl don't worry, ain't nobody know
This the type of stuff a joker keepin' on the low
Cause girl you know you're beautiful, a space kitten
Relationships are messed up but your face isn't
Used to taste like Jolly Ranchers
Kisses, now they taste different
Michael Jordan say "Hey Pippen"
Weightliftin', I hate sippin'
Ain't listen, paint glistenin' from the renaissance
Got a problem with the weather, fix it in the tennis box
Black helicopters, even let my menace watch
Keep it clean as Mr. Clean so jokers wear my Dennis socks
Look what I invented, y'all
Hit it with a tennis ball, no consent, I rented y'all
Land in the center, y'all, 3 dimes and a nickel
3 dimes and I write the reciprocal with a pencil
Luckily I'm your principal, luckily there's no principles
Except that you're invincible, only weakened the intervals
So listen close

You might not like me, but I like you
You might not like me, but I like you
We should just let it breathe
Let it breathe, let it—

I love you, without a reason
Like a baby was teethin', knew you 'fore I was breathin'
People say I'm a heathen, a Hollywood fugitive
Trippin' on some stupid ish, it's really just some ludicrous
Like "Who is this?" Oh he talk a lot of mess and bro
I'm too legit, you see that symbol on my chest
So you should move and sit, because you'll leak it to the press
If I sneeze in front of you, put my steez in front of you
Me and Moises whippin' the Porsche
And we ease in front of you
What you wanna do?
As long as there ain't helicopters I'm down to chill
I don't wanna call my father but swear that I will
Just to conversate and then I'll take care of the bill
Man I never thought I'd fly off to Paris for real
And all of my parents for real
Man I start to see how fictional characters feel
And that issue embarrass me still
Oh don't worry lil' homie, take care of the will
Polly's gone, but he left me his parrot, it's trill
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
And they run, they run
And they come, they come
And they run, they run

Sidelines in pride times, no lions
I'm so lyin' if I say I wasn't tryin' to buy into these games
Cupid ain't do no flyin', angels ain't do no cryin', just sighin'
I am 14, I got knots, there will be no tyin'
No Mayan can tell me what time I'ma find my mind
So when I'm in my deathbed dyin'
Imma be in some high end clothes with a MSFTS
Tie in my hand
With that red loud siren
I won't be denyin' my evil deeds
I'll be at Heaven's gate with a crowbar pryin'
While they're screamin, "Don't let this guy in"
Feelin' sorry for myself, Catcher in the Rye-in'
Then I woke up lyin' on the beach
(Where am I?)
One more for the kids before they go to sleep
Love is just so nonexistent in my existence
So that's why I was so persistent in that first quick instant
That we laid eyes
If young love for them is 16 then we must be infants
Cause this is intense, but I'm an eyewitness at love at first sight
But this is just different than anything I've been in
Cause it feels infinite
Most things that you think will last will pass in the blink of a lash
So I think I will submerge my feelings to complete this task
And best believe I'll drown before I let us crash
And seal it from the past
Jeez

The girl I could never have is elegant and intelligent
And I just kind of fell, but I'm irrelevant in her eyes
And this is somethin' I can settle with
I'm pourin' out my heart, and girl it's kind of for the hell of it
Girl you know that I ain't celibate
I know who your fellow is but we can walk the park
We can talk and we embellish in the creatures after dark
Cause I know that I'm a rebel kid
We come from different elements
But baby girl I can tell I get
On your nerves,  I'm watchin' you observe
It's like the world's an ocean and I watch while you emerge
You the center of attention, girl, no matter what occurs
Cause this youth is like a curse, but it's also like a blessing
Cause I keep these jokers guessing, MSFTS rep is what I'm dressed in
'Til these jokers learn a lesson
If you messin' with my clique, I suggest you get to steppin'
Girl, you're like Juliet with your nurse
And you're lookin' so pretty and I've just been on a search
You're the type of girl that I couldn't just write a verse
So I hit it with the poetry, hopin' that it'll work
If it doesn't then it's fine cause I'll just handle the jerks
Girl I'm playin', no I'm serious, that's just one of my perks
If we're friends then it's cool, just know that we were here first
Through the thick and the thin and now we're here 'til it hurts

Babygirl you got me floatin' down
Anywhere you wanna go
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
We can take it really slow
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
We can keep it on the low
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
And I didn't even know
(This was just a crush
This was just a crush
This was just a crush)

I can feel your body tryna come alive, come alive
I feel you tryna pull me deep inside, deep inside
No I don't wanna lie
Ain't nobody gotta hide, no
I can feel you touchin' me when we're home, we're old
Now I like to look at you, you're like my clone
So don't stare in the mirror
Cause I'll poop all on your party
I don't drive no white Ferrari
No things aren't clearer
I just want to say I'm sorry
But girl you should know yourself
These things ain't gettin' better
No they ain't lookin' up for us
Kissin' you, I'm up to dusk
So paparazzi hush and shush
She was in her 20's, just a crush
But you know I like it when you tell 'em
Bring the whole damn menu
And we eatin' in the venue
Girl you know you like to ball
Chillin' with your friends, nah, ain't see that at all
Man we like the Anunnaki, God ain't them jokers tall
You can't buy that at the mall
True love, you can't try that at the mall

No yeah, um we were really good in Paris, but you know
(No you wasn't!)
Every relationship has ups and downs and the downhills are what makes the uphills
(ups and downs are for a sissy!)
So when I'm feeling all this pain and feel like she doesn't love me or whatever
(she don't love you cause she with me cis'!)
It's just that contrast, but when I feel like she's the only person in the world I want to be with
(yeah right)
Just contrast with those times, you know what I'm saying?

Man I got some more to say
Have you ever had a crush?
Have you ever felt a rush?
Make your heart stop, she don't even like to blush
Cause she's in her 20's
And I got a crush
Oh man I got a crush
Got a psychedelic dagger in my heart
Lil' homie, tell them paramedics rush cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Man I'm 15 on the scene, lookin' clean
But what does that mean? Cause she's in her 20's
I got somethin' to say
Have you ever had a crush?
Have you ever had a rush?
Make my heart stop, but she didn't even blush
Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
She's somebody you can trust cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's

I hate crushes, I cover bruises with paintbrushes
Pour it all in the music now that my bank's ruptured
So pretty, she's so perfect, she's so worth it
So bossy, she's so assertive, it's super sexy
She never texts me, she never texts me, she never texts me
Never texts me, she never texts me, forgot to text me
Well I guess we accept the ones that neglect us
And my moms say that we disrespect the ones that perfect us
And try to protect us
But girl I hope that you get this
My thoughts are weighin' me down
My neck can't handle the necklace
Stare at you while you sleep, you had to call a detective
Your father says that I'm reckless, I didn't cause all that wreckage
Your fence was broken, I left it, had to give you this message
I wrote it straight from the soul and it didn't make sense to text it
So I snuck up in your room, put it on your shoulder and in return
You sent me back a restraining order
 
Woo, woo

When I jump, when I jump, wait I'm back on this again
From the back to the front, puffing vision, hittin’ licks
Task force in the cut, double up with the kicks
When they say I fucking did it, but I don't know what I did

Star Wars with the clique, I'm Han Solo with the rips
Kobe with the pass, had to hit it no assist (Swish)
Take her back to *bleep* then we let it coalesce
Icon livin’, never seen him in the flesh
Look, tell them boys I'm coming for they head top (Their head)
They talk a lot, just wait until my set drop (Drop)
I truly cannot wait to hear your next flop (Flop)
Be careful nigga, this is not your Xbox
Ooh, keep your chest up
This is just my desktop, flows out the Tesla
Now the gang got no shit to do, they just a chatterbox
Now I wear a muzzle to the bank, because I laugh a lot
Now I tell the paparazzi "Turn the fucking cameras off"
Now I gotta get the whole Cartier catalog
That's the only thing, I always knew I was an animal
Hottest on the block, what you thought, nigga, tenfold
Now I feel magnificent, I feel like I'm Lorenzo
I was feeling too indifferent, had to switch the tempo
I stay out the music business, I stay in the end zone
They said I would change with the chains
But the gangs all the same to this day

Where I jump, when I jump, wait I'm back on this again
From the back to the front, puffing vision, hittin' licks
Task force in the cut, double up with the kicks
When they say I fucking did it, but I don't know what I did

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
In the city lit again, in the city lit again
Had to cough up all my problems, think I lost a couple bands
Talkin' like they solid but they castles in the sand
Hop off in the phantom now the panic with the feds
Look, Florence 1450 in my head (In my head)
Keep that marble sculpture by my bed (By my bed, yeah)
If you not with it, play it to the left, stay right there

All this gold, oh, save my soul
You can keep me whole, ’cause I’m outta control
Take your break, go slow, hope just got so close
You went around in the city lights
Girl, we can paint such a pretty life
(Wish I could have told you what that was like)
Last week I dipped, girl, you did me right
Shaking up the bed with my hands tied
I admit I'm lost, can I hitch a ride?
Something bout your voice, like a lullaby
Whispers in my head, keep me up at night
But how could I be scared, with you right by my side?
(I was looking for you at Coachella, both of you)
We don’t get to talk a lot, now that you're all grown-up (What a shame)
Girl, just hop in the Wraith, send you flowers every day
Climb the tallest mountain in the city just to yell "I love ya"
But, baby, that was my mistake, see my heart when it breaks
Tends to always wanna say "Baby I love ya"
So girl just hop up in the–

Who the fuck turned this shit on, nigga
I told you don't play no motherfucking wack shit
Big drip only
