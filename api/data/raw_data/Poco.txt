Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by
A faded memory

Just when I think I'm over her
This broken heart will mend
I hear her name and I have to cry
The tears come down again

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wraps around my heart
Refusin' to unwind
Ooh-hoo, crazy love
Ah ha

Count the stars in a summer sky
That fall without a sound
And then pretend that you can't hear
These teardrops comin' down
It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wraps around my heart
Refusin' to unwind
Ooh-hoo, crazy love
Ah ha

Tonight I'm gonna break away
Just you wait and see
I'll never be imprisoned by
A faded memory

It happens all the time
This crazy love of mine
Wraps around my heart
Refusin' to unwind
Ooh-hoo, crazy love
Ah ha

Tonight I'm gonna break away...2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and
Look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window
Watchin', will they ever show
Can you hear them callin'
You know they have fallen
On campfires cold and dark
That never see a spark burn bright
Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Trails that brought them home
Echo names they've known
Four days high and lonely
Comin' to you only
You're the one they turned to
The only one they knew who'd do
All her best to be around
When the chips were down
Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and
Look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window
Watchin', will they ever show
Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Hearts like yours belong
Following the dawn
Wrapped up in a song
Rose of CimarronEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We've got all night
Let's take our time
Tell me your secrets
I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better
Call it love
You say you won't
I say you will
You make me crazy
But I want you still
When it makes us feel better
Call it love
Do we tell the truth
Or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good
Is that what makes you cry
When you say those words
Look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love
I play my hand
You call my bluff
We push each other
'Til we've had enough
When it's all you've got
Call it love
If I didn't have money
Would you want me still
When you look real close
Do we fit the bill
Call it what you want
But only time will tell
Do we tell the truth
Or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good
Is that what makes you cry
When you say those words
Look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love
We've got all night
Let's take our time
Tell me your secrets
I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better
Call it love
Call it love
Call it love
Call it love
When it's all you've got
Call it loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In the heart of the night
In the cool southern rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shining down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
She reminds me of you
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Oh, whoa, down in New Orleans
There's a night bird singing
Right on through till the dawn
And the streets are still ringing
With people carrying on
It's been so long waiting
Just to be here again
Anticipating
All the time I could spend
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
And I trust in your love never falling down
I trust in your love
Just like I do in this town
Whoa, never falling down
Whoa, never falling down
In the heart of the night
In the cool fallin' rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shining down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
Oh, momma, she reminds me of you
Right here, in the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Down in New Orleans
And I'm so glad to be back in New Orleans
Please don't wake me, don't shake me
If it's only, if it's only just a dream
It's the only place I can face that feels so right
Below that Dixie moon and loving you
In the heart of the night1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've been thinkin' 'bout
All the times you told me
You're so full of doubt
You just can't let it be, but I know
If you keep comin' back for more
Then I'll keep on tryin'
I'll keep on tryin'
And I've been drinkin' now
Just a little too much
And I don't know how
I can get in touch with you
Now there's only one thing for me to do
That's to keep on trying
To get home to you
And I feel so satisfied when I can see you smile, I
I want to confide in all that is true
So I keep on tryin'
I'm through with lyin'
Just like the sun above, I come shining through
Oh yes, I keep on tryin'
I'm tired of cryin'
I got to find a way to get on home to you
I've been thinkin' 'bout
All the times you held me
I never heard you shout
The flow of energy was so fine
Now I think I'll lay it on the line
And keep on tryin'
To get home to you
And I feel so satisfied when I can see you smile, I
I want to confide in all that is true
So I keep on tryin'
I'm through with lyin'
Just like the sun above, I come shining through
Oh yes I will
Oh yes, I keep on tryin'
I'm tired of cryin'
I got to find a way to get on home to you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There's a full moon in the sky
It's got a hold on me, I'm hypnotized
Like your love it's getting stronger
Please keep my heart a little longer
Indian Summer is on its way
It's cool at night, and hot all day
Ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa Ana wind blew them all to Maine
Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows this love is real
I'm a wide open space cowboy
I got lazy ways I got some hidden joy
Motorcycle and tons of RPM
Ain't gonna wait around till it's here again

Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows my love is real
An Indian Summer is on its way
It's cool at night, and hot all day
There ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa Ana wind blew them all to Maine
Blew them all to MaineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If I had one wish that would come true
I’ll tell you just exactly what I’ll do
I’d hold you in these loving arms of mine
Rock you till we both lose track of time
Hey now that I have come around
I said it straight to you
Won’t you tell me that your feeling just the way I do
I’ll leave it up to you
I knew all my restless days were through
Darling when I first set eyes on you
Cause something told me it just had to be
And your love wouldn’t make a fool of me
Hey now that I have come around
I said it straight to you
Won’t you tell me that your feeling just the way I do
I’ll leave it up to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Richie Furay)
I got a feeling about you, love who's fooling who
Crazy eyes I been a foolin' you
You sing songs about brass buttons and shiny silver shoes
Crazy eyes what had you to lose
Down among the South Caroline pines
You spent most of your lifetime in deep thought
Then changes come about and you find the time you spent
Wasn't quite reason for being bought
So now to be or not to be is the question...now
Crazy eyes don't you forget how
I'm used to seeing your face in the crowd and you thought you
Saw me
Crazy eyes blind as you can beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(John J. Cale)
Whippoorwill's singing, soft summer breeze;
Makes me think of my baby left down in New Orleans
I left down in New Orleans
Magnolia you sweet thing, you're driving me mad
Got to get back to you, baby;
You're the best I ever had;
You're the best I ever had;
You whisper, "Good Morning" so gently in my ear;
I'm coming to you baby;
I'll soon be there
I'll soon be thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What if I should say I love you ?
Would you spend some time ?
I'll tell you what I'm thinkin' of you
But if I do, do you have to know why ?
When I look at you, are you wonderin' who
I am to do such a thing to you ?
I bet you know that you're breakin' my heart
I bet you know ... my heart
What if I should say I love you ?
Baby, would you steal away my heart ?
And could the moment last for always
And ever ? Or should we even start ?
When you look at me, all the world can see
I suddenly want your love for me
I bet you know that you're breakin' my heart
Oh I bet you know ... my heart
Maybe someday I would be gone
Then you'd be alone wonderin' what's wrong
How could it begin and then be gone ?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Paul Cotton)
Well I've thought about the things I need
And I'm willing just to let them be
There is nothing that I'd want anyway
That could take the place of you
And all the things you do and say
We've come so very far in such a little time
And looking back there is only you that I find
Who was willing to give and maybe lose
You've got me tying up my walking shoes
These walking shoes
Twenty years on the run
I've only known a setting sun
Burning out on a lonely road
I've come to feel a lighter load
And now it's time we can turn the page
I believe you and I have come of age
All along it was there to see
What was really meant to be
It's a game the only one in town
It's a game all the changes going round
It's taken twenty years to get it on the way
And all I had to do was playEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What does it matter to me that you've gone
The memory's all in a dream
And though it seems I ought to be
With a good night's yawn, the heartache is gone
Yes Indeed
For lovin' you I have been such a fool
Hardly knowin' the game or the rules
Nothin' for me could I see except for your teasin'
I guess I was just dreamin'
Holdin' onto promises from you
What does it matter to me that you've gone
The memory's all in a dream
And though it seems I ought to be
With a good night's yawn, the heartache is gone
Yes Indeed
Just In Case It Happens, you see
I have paid all my dues faithfully
Now the peace of mind I feel inside is worth the misgivings
There's a new beginning clingin' in my head
The rest of it's been said
What does it matter to me that you've gone
The memory's all in a dream
And though it seems I ought to be
With a good night's yawn, the heartache is gone
Yes Indeed
The heartache is gone
Yes IndeedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dark as night, cold and lonely
Rides the horse that's known as only Thunder Road
Icy fingers hold the reins
While hoofs come poundin' so insanely on and on
Eyes that dance like burnin' embers
All the county still remembers who you are
Did she love you like they say?
And did she really run away ond leave you here?
Ride the wind
Tonight you'll find her there
No more racin'
With the damp night air
Down the road to Whitman's Crossing
Underneath the Widow's blossoms soft and green
Covered by the crimson shawl
Hidden by the leaves that fall down to the ground
Midnight comes and midnight goes
Inbetween the moonlight shadows veiled in tearsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
And ev'ry day that passes us by
And I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together
Looks like bad weather
And I can see it all there in your eyes
And it comes to me as no surprise
That you don't need me here no more
Your feeling tells the score
Your words, they are getting hard for me to find
You take me by my hand
And you're leading me blind
And ev'ry day that passes us by
And I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together
Looks like bad weather
Your words, they are getting hard for me to find
You go and you take me by my hand
And you’re leading me blind
And ev'ry day that passes us by
And I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together
Looks like bad weather
Yes it does
And I believe it's gonna rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Just down the road, some sixty miles away
There's smoke in the sky, she's going down in flames
Chorus:
Please wait for me, please wait for me
Time will fly like a cannonball, my darlin' you will see
Take all of my love and let it keep you warm
I shall return when we settle the score
(chorus)
Please wait for me
Oh I've waited so long, time has yet to prove who was right
Who was wrong
I have to justify all of my fears, down a broken road of tears
I love you, remember I need you, please wait for me
(Solo)
Just down the road, some sixty miles away
There's smoke in the sky, oh, she's going down in flames
(chorus)
Please, please wait for me, please wait for me
I'm goin' down the on stair, oh, but a heart with my head low
Please wait for me, my darlin' wait for me, please...
