I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

It's all I wanna be, is all, a woman
For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

Storm in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right

Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight

To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

After time, the bitter taste
Of innocence, descent, or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you
Nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
As she walks in the room
Centered and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realize that love flows

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Please, could you stay a while to share my grief
It's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread
Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

Doubled up inside
Take a while to shed my grief
Always doubled up inside
Taunted, cruel
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Inside, you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere
Where they can forget

Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean
Will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares
Who dares to condemn?
All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

Ooh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?

Ooh
Just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side
Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side

Done it warning, done it now
And it ain't real
Done it warning, done it now
'Cause this ain't real on this side

Ooh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't want to hurt you
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear

I'm sorry to remind
But I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream

And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet

But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child rose's light
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child rose's light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear
'Cause the child rose's light
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
