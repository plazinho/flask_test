I get up and nothing gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You gotta roll with the punches to get to what's real

Oh, can't you see me standing here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

Oh! Hey you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin

So can't you see me standing here?
I've got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Oh, can't you see what I mean?
Ah, might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Jump!


Might as well jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump
Get it and jump (Jump!)
Go ahead and jump

"Oh wow, man, that's it"
"Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?"
"My butt, man!"
Oh, uh!
Oh yeah!

T-t-teacher, stop that screamin'
Teacher, don't you see?
Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to Hell, but I'm doin' well
And teacher needs to see me after school

I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Ow, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher
"Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back!"
("I'm ready")
"I brought my pencil
Gimme something to write on, man!"
Yeah, go
Uh!
Ooh

I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold
I know about this school
Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how can you be so bold?
How did you know that golden rule?

I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Whoa, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher
Wha-oh

"Oh man, I think the clock is slow, man"
("What are you doing this weekend?")
"I don't feel tardy"
"Class dismissed!"
Ooh yeah

I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
Oh
Oh, a-yes I'm hot
Wow!

Oh my God!

Ooh
Oh yeah
Uh-huh, ah!

Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!

Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Out an on-ramp coming through my bedroom
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!
Uh-oh

Panama
Panama, ow
Panama, ah

Woo!


Ah
Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat coming off it, I say
I reach down between my legs and
Ease the seat back

She's blinding, I'm flying
Right behind in rearview mirror now
Got the fearing, power steering
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now

And all I've got I had to steal

Ooh, yeah

Ah, Ah-ha yeah, whoo-hoo-ooh

When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home

Ahh, yeah

So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree
Ooh, baby, baby
Won'tcha turn your head my way?
Ooh, baby, baby
Come on, take a chance, you're old enough to
Dance the night away

A live wire
Barely a beginner, but just watch that lady go
She's on fire
'Cause dancing gets her higher than anything else she knows

Don't wanna wait til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One more walk through problems
Built up, and stand in our way, ah
One step ahead, one step behind me
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey
C'mon turn, turn this thing around

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
C'mon, it's everything
Right now
Catch a magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything
Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trade in one for the other
Workin' so hard, to make it easier, whoa
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around

It's enlightened me, right now
What are you waitin' for
Oh, yeah, right now


Right now, oh, Right now
It's what's happening?
Right here and now
Right now
It's right now

You've got me captured, I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture, yes, I know it well
Another page is turned
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

You can't imagine what your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic greets everyone who reads
Heartbreak in motor drive
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune, yeah!
You reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind

Run, run, run, away
Like a train runnin' off the track
The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
Never losing sight, oh!
Well just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh that's what dreams are made of
Cause we belong in a world that must be strong
Ohh that's what dreams are made of


We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
Higher and higher leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher who knows what we'll find

So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of
Ohh, baby we belong in a world that must be strong
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of
And in the end on dreams we will depend
Cause thats what love is made of1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 

 
I am a victim of the science age, uh
A child of the storm, whoa yes
I can't remember when I was your age
For me, time's no more, no more

Nobody rules these streets at night but me
The atomic punk!

Whoa yeah, wow
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
The underground, whoa yes
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Just look around, whoa yes

Nobody rules these streets at night but me
