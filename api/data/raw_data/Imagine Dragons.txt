First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
 
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
 
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
 
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
 
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
 
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass, find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Natural
Yeah, you're a natural
 
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me
 
There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today

There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier

So come with me
You'll come with me
So come with me
You'll come with me
Not today
Not today
Not today
Not today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today
 
Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

Oh
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)


Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You're shattered on the ground, (Shattered on the ground)
But still, I find you there (Yeah)
Next to me
And, oh, stupid things I do (Stupid things I do)
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (Next to me)
 
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
 
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had to just walk away (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up (Couldn't be, couldn't be)
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
 
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out
 
I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

(Rise, rise up)
(Rise, rise up)
 
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust


Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust
 
We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

I don't know why

I don't know why (Ah)
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you) (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
 
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in, but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
I'm on top of the world, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Waiting on this for a while now
(Get up, now, get up)
Paying my dues to the dirt
(Get up, now)
I've been waiting to smile, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
Been holding it in for a while, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Take you with me if I can
(Get up, now, get up)
Been dreaming of this since a child
(Get up, now)
I'm on top of the world
 
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
 
You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepеst low
I'll always be around wherevеr life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

You're not the type to give yourself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here coming through)

I will follow you way down wherever you may go (I'll follow you)
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you (I'll follow you)
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you
 
About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read (No time)

I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (no time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

No lies and no deceiving
Man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that
Death is from above (No time)

I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (No time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

Life isn't always what you think it’d be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
A son of a
 
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition

'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine

I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision

'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine

I am the machine

'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine
