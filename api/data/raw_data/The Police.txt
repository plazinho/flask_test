Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take?

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take)
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
(Every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day)
(Every word you say)
(Every game you play)
(Every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every move you make)
(Every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake)
(Every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day)
(Every word you say)
(Every game you play)
(Every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take)
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
(Every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day)

I'll be watching you
(Every single day)

I'll be watching you...
 
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light, oh

I loved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to ya
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your make up
Told you once
I won't tell you again it's a bad way

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

(Roxanne) You don't have
To put on the red light

Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
 
Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day
With no one here but me, oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle (Yeah)
Message in a bottle (Yeah)

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle (Yeah)
Message in a bottle (Yeah)
(Oh) Message in a bottle (Yeah)
Message in a bottle (Yeah)

Walked out this morning
Don't believe what I saw
Hundred billion bottles
Washed up on the shore
Seems I'm not alone at being alone
Hundred billion castaways
Looking for a home

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle (Yeah)
Message in a bottle (Yeah)
Message in a bottle (Oh)
Message in a bottle (Yeah)

Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
She does is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ey oh, yo oh
Eee oh oh oh oh oh

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet
 
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above
The din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany
Of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take

Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered
Through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like
Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting
With his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch

Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch


Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings
Into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel
And stares alone into the distance
He knows that something
Somewhere has to break
He sees the family home
Now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs
That makes his eyeballs ache

Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
 
You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turn into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air, you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master

Oh, you'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
Ohh
 
There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat
Caught in a high tree top
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

There's a little black spot
On the sun today
(That's my soul up there)
It's the same old thing as yesterday
(That's my soul up there)
There's a black hat
Caught in a high treetop
(That's my soul up there)
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop
(That's my soul up there)

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

There's a fossil that's trapped
In a high cliff wall
(That's my soul up there)
There's a dead salmon
Frozen in a waterfall
(That's my soul up there)
There's a blue whale beached
By a spring tide's ebb
(That's my soul up there)
There's a butterfly trapped
In a spider's web
(That's my soul up there)

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

There's a king on a throne
With his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking
For a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man
Sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton
Choking on a crust of bread

King of pain

There's a red fox torn
By a huntsman's pack
(That's my soul up there)
There's a black-winged gull
With a broken back
(That's my soul up there)
There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday

I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

King of pain, king of pain
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain
 
Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could live together
Walking on, walking on the moon

Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Feet they hardly touch the ground
Walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say
I'm wishing my days away
No way, and if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay, I may as well play

Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could be together
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say
I'm wishing my days away
No way, and if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay, I may as well play

Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up, keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
 
Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
They're only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
Because when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true
 
I've called you so many times today
And I guess it's all true
What your girlfriends say
That you don't ever want to see me again
And your brother's gonna kill me
And he's six feet ten
I guess you'd call it cowardice
But I'm not prepared to go on like this

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you

I see you've sent my letters back
And my LP records and they're all scratched
I can't see the point in another day
When nobody listens to a word I say
You can call it lack of confidence
But to carry on living doesn't make no sense

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

I guess this is our last goodbye
And you don't care so I won't cry
But you'll be sorry when I'm dead
And all this guilt will be on your head
I guess you'd call it suicide
But I'm too full to swallow my pride

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand
Can't stand losing you
 
Well, someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere
But I just can't convince myself
I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely

Now no-one's knocked upon my door
For a thousand years, or more
All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one man show
Just take a seat, they're always free
No surprise, no mystery
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role

So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely

I feel lonely, I'm so lonely, I feel so low
I feel lonely, I'm so lonely, I feel so low
 
With one breath, with one flow
You will know synchronicity
A sleep trance, a dream dance
A shared romance, synchronicity

A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible

If we share this nightmare
We can dream spiritus mundi
If you act as you think
The missing link, synchronicity

A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
Oh!

We know you, they know me
Extrasensory, synchronicity
A star fall, a phone call
It joins all, synchronicity

A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible

It's so deep, it's so wide
You're inside synchronicity
Effect without a cause
Sub-atomic laws
Scientific pause
Synchronicity

Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity, oh!
 
Once that you've decided on a killing
First you make a stone of your heart
And if you find that
Your hands are still willing
Then you can turn a murder into art
There really isn't
Any need for bloodshed
You just do it with a little more finesse
If you can slip a tablet
Into someone's coffee
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess

Because it's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABC
It’s murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABC

Now if you have a taste for this experience
And you're flushed
With your very first success
Then you must try
A twosome or a threesome
And you'll find your conscience
Bothers you much less
Because murder is like anything you take to
It's a habit-forming need for more and more
You can bump off
Every member of your family
And anybody else you find a bore

Because it's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABC
It's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABC

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious
In history's great dark hall of fame
All our greatest killers were industrious
At least the ones that we all know by name
But you can reach the top of your profession
If you become the leader of the land
For murder is the sport of the elected
And you don't need
To lift a finger of your hand

Because it's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABC
Murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABCDE

123, ABC
123, ABC
123, ABC

 It's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABC
It's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3
It's as easy to learn as your ABCDE
 
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads
Itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
It's just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head
There in the dark
Can't see for the brightness
Is staring me blind
As I bid yesterday goodbye

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight


Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
 
One, two, three, four, five, six
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't want to spend the rest of my life
Looking at the barrel of an Armalite
I don't want to spend the rest of my days
Keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say
I don't want to spend my time in hell
Looking at the walls of a prison cell
I don't ever want to play the part
Of a statistic on a government chart

There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope
When the whole day's done

It's dark all day and it glows all night
Factory smoke and acetylene light
I face the day with my head caved in
Looking like something that the cat brought in

There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope
When the whole day's done

And they're only going to change this place
By killing everybody in the human race
They would kill me for a cigarette
But I don't even want to die just yet

There has to be an invisible sun
It gives its heat to everyone
There has to be an invisible sun
That gives us hope
When the whole day's done
 
There is no political solution
To our troubled evolution
Have no faith in constitution
There is no bloody revolution

We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world

Our so-called leaders speak
With words they try to jail you
They subjugate the meek
But it's the rhetoric of failure

We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world

Where does the answer lie?
Living from day to day
If it's something we can't buy
There must be another way

We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
 
First to fall over when the atmosphere is less than perfect
Your sensibilities are shaken by the slightest defect
You live you life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

You say you want to spend the winter in Firenza
You're so afraid to catch a dose of influenza
You live your life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

Canary in a coalmine
Canary in a coalmine
Canary in a coalmine

Now if I tell you that you suffer from delusions
You pay your analyst to reach the same conclusions
You live your life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

Canary in a coalmine
Canary in a coalmine
Canary in a coalmine

First to fall over when the atmosphere is less than perfect
Your sensibilities are shaken by the slightest defect
You live you life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

Canary in a coalmine
 
Well, the telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is screaming
Won't she leave me alone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone? Ahh

Well, every girl that I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Every girl I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Well, I hear my mother calling
But I don't need her as a friend
Well, every girl I go out with
Becomes my mother in the end
Oh, ohh, mother
Mother
Mother

Oh mother dear, please listen
And don't devour me
Oh mother dear, please listen
Don't devour me
Oh women, please have mercy
Let this poor boy be
Oh mother dear, please listen
And don't devour me
Oh mother

Well, the telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
The telephone is screaming
Won't she leave me alone?
The telephone is ringing
Is that my mother on the phone?
Oh, , mother, ohhhh

Mother, mother mother
Mother mother, mother, mother, mother...
 
Bed's too big without you
Cold wind blows right
Through that open door
I can't sleep with your memory
Dreaming dreams of what used to be
When she left I was cold inside
That look on my face was just pride
No regrets no love no tears
Living on my own
Was the least of my fears

Now the bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without you

Since that day when you'd gone
Just had to carry on
I get through the day but late at night
Made love to my pillow
But it didn't feel right
Every day, just the same
Old rules for the same old game
All I gained was heartache
All I made was one mistake

The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without you
