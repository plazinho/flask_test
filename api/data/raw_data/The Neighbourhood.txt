All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater481EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (ah)
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl

I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you

And R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth
And you can play this at my funeral
Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin
Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain
I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?
Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah
R.I.P. to my youth
If you really listen, then this is to you
Mama, there is only so much I can do
Tough for you to witness but it was for me too

I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me (In front of me)

R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth, yeah
You can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock
When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop
When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop
I was naive and hopeful and lost
Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, wow
What do I do? What do I do?
I don't believe it if I don't keep proof
I don't believe it if I don't know you
I don't believe it if it's on the news or on the Internet
I need a cigarette

I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me
I'm using white lighters to see

R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth
And you can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me be with the stars

When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place

Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)
Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
Oh, if they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it
And I can't even see if it’s out there, anymore
So

You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)
Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me, then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience
Calms me down, lets me face this, let me sleep
And when I wake up, let me be

When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place

If I told you that I loved you
Tell me, what would you say?
If I told you that I hated you
Would you go away?
Now I need your help with everything that I do
I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you

Fallin' again
I need a pick-me-up
I've been callin' you "friend,"
I might need to give it up

I'm sick, and I'm tired too
I can admit, I am not fireproof
I feel it burning me
I feel it burning you
I hope I don't murder me
I hope I don't burden you
If I do, If I do

If I meet you in the middle maybe we could agree
You make me feel little how you're looking at me
And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off
First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving on
Fallin' again

Just don't look underneath us
I need you here with me but we're out in the open

I think I talk too much
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen good
I think I try too hard
How I look, what I do, what I'm saying
I spend too much time explaining myself
I hope there's some time to change it

I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
But you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

I think I worry a lot
I need to take it easy
I got this anxious feeling
But it goes away for a minute
When I'm with you breathing

I don't know if we should be alone together
I still got a crush, that's obvious
If nobody's around, what's stopping us?
Everywhere I go you show whatever
I don't ever mind sharing oxygen
I just wanna get lost in your lungs

Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast
And I'm allergic to the waiting
She's just a baby girl
And I love to watch her dance
But it's making me go crazy

Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

I don't think that we should be around each other
When you're in the room, you get my eyes
You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized
I can make you laugh until you cry
You know you got all my attention
You know you got all mine
"Baby," I can't help but call her that
Even though I shouldn't say it
She was my baby girl
Might never get her back
But I don't mind being patient, yeah

Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

Okay
I'm just gonna tell you what I gotta say
Right here
I'm sorry Dave, I never meant to hurt your baby girl
She's your little baby, she's my soulmate
I don't want you to worry, she'll be so safe right here
Oh, so
Dave, would you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

As long as you notice
I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
If you don't ask, I won't tell
Just know that, just know that
It all hurts, it all hurts just the same

Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know what they might do if they catch you too early
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

As long as you notice
I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind

Probably tell me that you're alright

You look better when you first wake up
Than anybody else I've fucked

We talked about making it
I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me just to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason
It killed you like diseases
And I can hear it in your voice while you're speaking
You can't be treated
Mr. Know-it-all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all

If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

He told me I should take it in, listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking
As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
Well, I can tell the wires pulled
If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

I'm having trouble in believing
And I just started seeing
Light at the beginning of the tunnel
But he tells me that I'm dreaming
When he talks I hear his ghosts
Every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming

If he said "help me kill the president"
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming "let us in"
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell

Lost and afraid, young and innocent but getting older
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
Sharper the blade is, the easier it scars your soul
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone

My current state is heavy
Hope it's a phase or something

Don't let me go

Up and away, I'm an alien, I need a moment
I don't know what to believe
All I wanna do is leave
What can I say that would make you see, make you need me?
Maybe I won't ever know, maybe I'll end up alone

Running in place (circles, in circles with you)
Don't mind me, out in a race (I didn't mean to be here)

Watch me go
I don't wanna let you down
So, promise you won’t let me drown
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
I got some mixed emotions about how I've been getting to all these checks
Acting all funny because of the money
It's making my tummy upset
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
Somebody find me a balance
Look what I did to myself and my friends
Emotions are paying the rent, oh
Emotions are paying the rent, oh

Hope you don't regret it
I pushed a lot back but I can't forget it
We never got the credit
Nobody seemed to hear us but we said it
Neither of us planned it
And for a long time I took it all for granted
I really thought we had it
But at the time it was more than I could manage, so

If we can leave it all behind us
And meet in between
It would get me so

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

Wish I didn't doubt it
I wish I never ever told you all about it
But I just had to let you know
I never meant to hurt you, though
I had all my motives
I didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions
I just had to reach my goals
Never knew I'd meet you though, so
If we can agree to disagree
And keep on reaching
It would get you so

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

We should stick together
You're my best friend, I'll love you forever (Would you come with me?)
(It would get you so)
We could be the greatest, it doesn't matter if we're never rich or famous (Would you come with me?)
(It would get you so)

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

Started with a little bit
Now I don't know how to quit
Always feel inadequate
Same way that my daddy did
Mama told me not to try
And I should have taken her advice
And now I'm all twisted
When it's all gone, I miss it

I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'

Thought you could better me but
Then you stopped lettin' me walk
Now you're just settin' me off
So I'm tryna lose you

I'll fight just to do somethin'
I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'

She was five foot four with some money on the floor
And a box that's hidden under her bed
I was only 22 with a pocket full of truth
But I gave her everything that I had
We were born and raised in the Golden State
Mommy's gone and daddy's doing his best
I was brought up great, living Section 8
Social security's paying the rent, ohh
The landlord called, she said "you gotta go"
Little one, you just lost your—

Yeah
She was five foot four, getting money on tour
But her socks were at the end of my bed
Got our names tattooed on each other
Just to prove to each other that we'd do what we said
Only took a few days till our minds were made up
And we thought we should try it again
I was only 17 when we first tried things
When she first made me feel like a man, ohh

Who am I gonna call?
Who's gonna catch me when I—
Who's the one you're sleeping with?
Well, don't just sit in front of me and wait for me to talk
You can call me up, phone works two ways, you know
This time, baby, yeah, I think that I'll be just fine
And I wish I could say the same for you
I, yeah, I do, I—
Hey!



To those of you in which I choose to always be the closest to
There's something that you need to know: loving me is not a joke
And you can put it all on me, you can laugh and you can bleed
And I'll adopt it all because that's what a buddy does
I loved you from minute one, the iced tea to my lemonade
Never one to hit and run, soaking every minute made
You can give me all your juice, I can squeeze it out for you
And all I ask you in exchange, love me back through every phase
If it ever comes off wrong or leaves you with a bitter taste
Just remember you're the tea
And I'm your sour lemonade, I'm your sour lemonade
Tropical iced tea and hot pink lemonade18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shh, Neighbourhood, maybe you can describe it a little better for me (Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

Just got cheated on, no it's not my day
That's not my bitch, she's not my girl, she's not my bae

But it hurts me to know

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting
I can't even, can't even hear your side
Shame on me, you fooled me twice
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else

You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad

Bought a hundred chains now the bitches all linger (Linger)
Walk by the crib, smell the kitchen all stanky (Stank)
Floor seats, 4 quarter, spent a quarter on the link (Woo!)
Ridin' through Philly, Meek Milly, double R (Still rich)
Still ridin' through the strip catchin' licks with my dog
30 for the whole, 15 for the half (Eh)
You could break it down, come and see me with the bag (Ay)
Shorty fell in love with a young rich nigga
Blunt full of smoke and a cup full of liquor
Say what I mean and I mean what I said baby
Silk sheets, I be slippin' off the bed baby

I can't even, I can't even believe what you did to me
You can't even, you can't even say I'm overreacting
I can't even, can't even hear your side
Shame on me, you fooled me twice
And you said I wasn't just like anyone, like
But you treated me just like everyone, like everyone else

You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Whoop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
