I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A, Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, "Little boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Well, I looked at her, and she at me

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man"
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola

Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night

But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Millions of people swarming like flies
Round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound

And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everythin' I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I ought to stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime
Oh, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things that I own I will share with you
And, if I feel tomorrow, like, I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And, if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Cause he gets up in the morning
And he goes to work at nine
And he comes back home at five-thirty
Gets the same train every time
Cause his world is built round punctuality
It never fails

And he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively

And his mother goes to meetings
While his father pulls the maid
And she stirs the tea with councilors
While discussing foreign trade
And she passes looks, as well as bills
At every suave young man

Cause he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively
And he likes his own backyard
And he likes his fags the best
Cause he's better than the rest
And his own sweat smells the best
And he hopes to grab his fathers loot
When pater passes on

Cause he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively

And he plays at stocks and shares
And he goes to the regatta
And he adores the girl next door
Cause he's dying to get at her
But his mother knows the best about
The matrimonial stakes

Cause he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I think I'm sophisticated
'Cause I'm living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybody's multiplying
'Til they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
'Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man

I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man

I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm voodoo man
I'm an ape man
'Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man
"In man's evolution he has created the city and
The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle"

'Cause the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury
To be like an ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I look out the window, but I can't see the sky
'Cause the air pollution is a-fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man

Come on and love me
Be my ape man girl
And we'll be so happy
In my ape man world
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Long ago, life was clean
Sex was bad, called obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen

Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I'm poor, I am free
When I grow, I shall fight
For this land, I shall die
Let her sun never set

Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Land of hope and the gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and the gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all

Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's
At your disposal if you feel so inclined
Well alright
We're gonna travel faster than light
So do up your overcoat tight
And you'll go anywhere you want to decide
Well alright

Too many people
Side by side
Got no place to hide

On my supersonic rocket ship
Nobody has to be hip
Nobody needs to be out of sight (Oh, out of sight, man, far out)
Nobody's gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities

We'll take this planet
Shake it 'round
And turn it upside down
On my supersonic rocket ship

It ain't no magic
Ain't no lie
You'll laugh so loud, you'll cry
Up and down
Round and round
On my supersonic rocket ship

Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's
At your disposal if you feel so inclined
Well alright
Nobody gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities

When I was small, I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stockings at Christmas
Open my presents, and I'd be glad
But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor
They said

Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want no jigsaw or Monopoly money
We only want the real McCoy

Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
Give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one, I'll take a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids on the street

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothing
While you're drinking down your wine

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas please hand it over we'll beat up don't make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
Beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boysEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
