Will your lover caress you the way that I did?
(I did, I did, I did)

Yeah, you bet she know that we ain't
Never gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see you when
I'm feeling like a drum without a beat
Yeah, you dance so good
And I think that's kinda neat

What you know about life?
What you know about blood?
Bitch, you ain't even my type
Yeah right, yeah right

And I think that's kinda neat
 
Go ahead and park after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape

When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real

If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Hold me oh so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
 
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is goin' slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around a bit and get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't really wanna run around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Saying all the rhymes that make your world go
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round

'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round

Cupid pass another my way (My way)
Another night, a lot more days (More days)
Hard to think about you anymore ('Bout you anymore)
But I keep you in my mind always (Always)
Called me on the phone last night (Last night)
Couldn't hear your voice, I fight (I fight)
I won't be around you anymore (Around you anymore)
In a dream where you feel alright

I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is goin' slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around a bit and get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

I don't really wanna run around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Saying all the rhymes that make your world go
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round

Fuck around and you won't stay
Tellin' me that you're okay
Just better if you stay away
Better if you stay away
Won't you stay away?
Stay away, stay away
Alright
 
Yuh, got 'em
Sus, runnin'
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
Yuh, got 'em
Sus, runnin'
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted

You're taking my heart, now
They're taking my heart, now
And I don't know why (Come)
And I don't know why (Come, come with me)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
The demons told me everything
They whisper in the night (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

This is not a threat, I promise (Nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know

That was when the ceiling caved in
When I'm falling in a trench, I'm behaving (Skrrt)
I'm behaving myself (Uh)
I'm behaving myself (Look, look, what, what)
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for you, for you, for you
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for–(Shh, quiet)

This is not a threat, I promise (Nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know

Please, just let me go
Let me go, I've seen enough
I've seen enough
I've seen enough
(That sounds good)
 
I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?

I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I’m not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run (Ooh)

You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I traveled the country just to get to you

I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run

And I traveled the country
And I traveled the country just to get to you
I know you’re not in love
I know you’re not in love
I know you're not in love
 
Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson

Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light, no

I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you

Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not?
 
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
 
I can't get over you
Can’t get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can

Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me, to the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I don’t know right (Don't know right)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you (Ayy)

I can't get over you (Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh)
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray (Yup) that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won’t be no fun
If I can’t have you, no one can
 
She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She just wanna feel alive (She just wanna feel alive)
She just wanted more time (She just wanted more time)
I'm looking for a long ride (Looking for a long ride)
She just want a test drive (She just want a test drive)
Dying on the west side (Dying on the west side)
I'll see you in the next life (See you in the next life)

What do you want, babe? (What do you want, babe?)
I don't like when you taunt me (I don't like when you taunt me)
You've been calling the wrong name (Calling the wrong name)
I said what do you want, babe? (What do you want, babe?)
I'm working on my aim (Working on my aim)
I'm hoping you do the same (Do the same)
You got me afraid again (Got me afraid again)
So let me just pray again (So let me just pray again)

You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you

She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive (What do you want, babe?)
Dying on the west side (What do you want, babe?)
I'll see you in the next life (Who do you want, babe?)

Waiting on a sacrificial life
Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song, you lied

You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you

She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She just wanna feel alive (She just wanna feel alive)
She just wanted more time (She just wanted more time)
I'm looking for a long ride (Looking for a long ride)
She just want a test drive (She just want a test drive)
Dying on the west side (Dying on the west side)
I'll see you in the next life (See you in the next life)
 
Oh
Oh
Oh

Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone (Oh)
Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love (Oh)
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

Swing around front, let me inside
Playin' my song into my sides
It hurts, I can't lie
Remember those times I fought to get out?
I want to get out
Those pictures so clear, will fade in my mind
You're leavin' me here with ashes and fire
These people don't heal, these people don't feel
These people aren't real, so make me this deal
Won't you?

Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love
When I'm gone (Ooh), when I'm gone (When I'm gone, yeah)
Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love (When I'm gone, yeah)
Gimme, gimme love, gimme, gimme love (When I'm gone, yeah)
When I'm gone (Ooh, yeah), when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
(When I'm gone, when I'm gone)

Look into your heart and let me know
Do things turn black and gray as they go?
When I'm far too gone, can you show me love?
Give me love
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Caught in a river of records and dreams (Ooh)
Oh, will you keep up with me? (Ooh)
Everyone's looking for someone to hold (Ooh)
But I can't let you go (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
 
I looked at you and said, oh-oh-oh
Don't hate me, am I crazy?
So tenderly you watch me burn, you watch me burn, oh
So tell me, am I crazy?

'Cause I do, 'cause I do
'Cause I do, 'cause I do
'Cause I do, 'cause I do

Ooh (La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la, goddamn)
Ooh (Oh)
And I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
 
When it's lovely
I believe in anything
What does love mean
When the end is rolling in? (Ooh)
Let it go, let it stay, can we love one another?
Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?
Who knows? (Who knows?)
I said who knows?

Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know
This is your world (This is your world)
This is your world (This is your world)

Quietly still
In a lie
Oh, goodnight
I don't mind

Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know (Let you know)
 
Lately, I can't help but think
That our roads might take us down different phases
Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we've got
But I'm speechless
When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?
Painless?

If you ever go, all the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies

Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do

Since I met you
All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
Consider what we've got
'Cause I can never take you for granted
Is there another us on this whole planet?
Planet?

If you ever go, all the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies

Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do

No one loves me like you do

I don't wanna seem foolish
When I'm jumping into this
You're all that I see

Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do

No one loves me like you do
 
I'm a, I’m a, I'm a, I'm a, I’m a, I'm a (One, two, three, four)
I'm a pretty boy livin' on the West side
Livin' so loud, you could never hear me cry, nay-ay
See no tears run down my eyes (Run down my eyes)
Oh, these hills, they burn so bright (They burn so bright)
Oh, these hills, they bring me life (Bring me life)
Oh, these hills, baby, oh, these hills, baby, mmm (I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I’m a, I’m a, I'm a)

I’m a pretty boy livin' on the West side
Poppin' blue pills and sippin' on finest, nay-ay (Brrt)
No more fears and no more lies
I tell myself to sleep at night (Sleep at night)
Amongst these hills, baby (Oh, these hills, baby)
Amongst these hills, baby (I’m a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey (Bitch), hey, hey (Suck my nuts)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Handsome young man, never pull up on time
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' good should be a crime, crime
All this pain I'll never let show (No)
My real thoughts, you'll never know (No)
Never know (No, no), never know (No, no, no)
Handsome young man, never worried 'bout time
Flexin' on the 'net, it's the same offline (Offline), ay-ay (Offline)
If I don't lead, where will they go?
They follow my every move
Every move (Every move), every move, every move (Every move)

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a (Goddamnit, nice shot)
I'm a pretty boy livin' on the West side
Livin' so loud, you could never hear me cry, nay-ay
See no tears run down my eyes (Run down my eyes)
Oh, these hills, they burn so bright (They burn so bright)
Oh, these hills, they bring me life (Bring me life)
Oh, these hills, baby, oh, these hills, baby, mmm (I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)
 
Here I am
Torn into a thousand shapes and folds
Torn into a thousand ways, I know
Fornicate inside your broken homes
Before I throw a smile your way, no more

I can't tell
If all my answers correlate at all
I'm telling you a thousand things I know

I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
We'll make it out alive

I'm on trial
I'm not so good at hiding wholesome truths
You see it on my face when I turn blue
So punish me, I'm hanging on your noose
So pull me up so I can breathe with you

I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
We'll make it out alive

Ah, ah, ah, ah
 
Speed it up, slow it down
Need control, need it now
I need to live a thousand times
I cannot stop, I cannot cry
I will not fret, I will not die
I am machine, I stay alive
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think
Sometimes I think, sometimes I (Ooh)
I've got no aim, a million rounds, is nothing real?
A hundred pounds of heavy steel, it feels so loud
Tied to my chest, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat and I'm quite unique
But I'd like to be, but I'd like to be

And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you

Sorry, you can see it in my retina
Focus in and out, I'm doing better
Artificial ghost with no perception
I wanna be a Chevy, not a Sentra, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today
Some pieces falling from the waist up
I'm so sorry for delays
Just need one moment to erase
That burning pain before the rage
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good (I fixed it)

And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
 
I find it hard to be myself
I shed my skin for everybody else
You don't know me, what the fuck you mean?
You made me sad and you made me mean
And now I'm mad, I feel unclean (I feel unclean, I feel unclean)
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
You made me a bitter fuck
Ay, ay (Fuck)

Now I'm a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you

Your bitch is lame, don't follow me
Your bitch just came all over me
I don't wanna live in my skin no more
I won't fuck with you if you don't fuck with me

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me (Ay, ay)

Now I'm a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you

Now I don't give a fuck
Now I don't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
 
I see nothing out the window, window
Nothing out the window
Watching all the leaves grow, leaves grow
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though

And the sun will shine, no more
The sun will shine (antidote), no more
I've been holding on, too long
Holding on too

I know when the wind blows, wind blows
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though
I just wanna sleep forever
Please just let me leave, forever

I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, forever
(Forever, forever)

We don't wanna drive slow, drive slow
Speed up with our eyes closed, eyes closed

Eyes closed, eyes closed
Head down, eyes closed
Ice cold, meltdown
