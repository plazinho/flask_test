Go ahead and park after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape

When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real
If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Hold me oh so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need161EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?

I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I’m not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run (Ooh)

You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I traveled the country just to get to you

I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run
And I traveled the country
And I traveled the country just to get to you

Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson

Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light, no

I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not?84EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold129EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I can't get over you
Can’t get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can

Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me, to the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I don’t know right (Don't know right)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you (Ayy)

I can't get over you (Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh)
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray (Yup) that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won’t be no fun
If I can’t have you, no one can65EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
