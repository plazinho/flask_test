Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you, I know
Only when you stop to think about me, do you know?

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?
I hate, you hate
I hate, you love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
 
This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late

No one will ever see the side reflected
And if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late

The world we knew won't come back
Time we've lost, can't get it back
Life we had won't be ours again
This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late
 
I can't escape this hell
So many times I've tried
But I’m still caged inside

Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal)
(This animal)

I can’t escape myself
(I can’t escape myself)
So many times I’ve lied
(So many times I’ve lied)
But there’s still rage inside

Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal

Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can’t escape this hell

This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal
This animal

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal

This animal I have become
 
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin' all that's meant for me?

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', I keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

So if I'm not already too far gone
And if I feel a pulse then I can carry on
When I'm lost and wanna fade away
I tell myself to live, to die another day

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain, the mountain
 
(From the darkness I see the light in you)

Don't stress, don't stress
No one knows what goes on in our heads, our heads
We are invisible to the rest, the rest
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have, we have

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you’re burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

It's okay, okay
They won't understand us anyway, no
You and I are on a different wave
So, doesn't even matter what they say

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

Everyone's living in black and white
We see each other in a different light
That's why I look at you like I do
Like nobody else is even in the room
We see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
If you fall into me, I fall into you
I see you, I see you
(From the darkness I see the light in you)
 
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me, and take my hand
When the lights go out you'll understand

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go up you'll understand

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain

I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That you're wounded
You know, you know, you know, you know (you know)
That I'm here to save you
You know, you know, you know, you know (you know)
I'm always here for you
I know, I know, I know, I know (I know)
That you'll thank me later

Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain
 
If you feel so empty, so used up, so let down
If you feel so angry, so ripped off, so stepped on
You're not the only one refusing to back down
You're not the only one, so get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so filthy, so dirty, so fucked up
If you feel so walked on, so painful, so pissed off
You're not the only one refusing to go down
You're not the only one, so get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so empty, so used up, so let down
If you feel so angry, just get up
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
 
I don't know what you mean
I don't know what you mean
I don't
Ich weiß nicht, was du meinst

Sometimes I just wanna run away
Run away, run away
I only wanna disappear
Far from here
Away from everyone
Before I come undone
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Moving on, moving on

I've been thinking about it
Too much doubting
All of these feelings
Too many reasons to run
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on

I put my head down, keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
And I'm never, ever getting close to anyone again
I put my head down keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
I'm never, ever getting close to anyone again
And I don't even know where I'm going to
But I don't want any motherfucking part of you
I've been waiting for this moment for way too long
I don't know where I'm going, but I just keep moving on

Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
 
On the ground I lay, motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep?
Is this all a dream?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die  (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

On this bed I lay, losing everything
I can see my life passing me by
Was it all too much?
Or just not enough?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying


I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
(Feel alive)
I will not die, I'll wait here for you (Feel alive)
I feel alive when you're beside me (Feel alive)
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
 
I'm on the outside looking through
I know I'm not the same as you
I'd rather be faceless and ignored
Than be in the in-crowd, desperate for
A way to fit in just a little more

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now

I don't wanna be any part of your scene
I don't believe what you believe
I'd rather be faceless in the dark
Than be so fake like the way you are
Yeah, that's why I stay so far away from you

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now

There comes a time we draw the line
Decide we're better off on the outside
Better off on the outside
There comes a time we draw the line
Decide we're better off on the outside

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now
 
You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me
Now I'm gonna give you what you need
Cause I know what you feed on
And what you lean on, and what you lean on

The shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

Did you find another cure?
Did you find another cure?

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Painkiller
 
Late at night I could hear the crying
I hear it all trying to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dying

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

A fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

A fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
Just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
And I, I couldn't save a fallen angel

Fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
Just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
