Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now, me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown

Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump into the river and drown
Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Stop ramblin', stop your gamblin'
Stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by your fireside, bright

Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreamsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I was young and short of tongue
A silly wee fool was I
The morning after I left the school
I heard my mother sigh
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
I bought a clock, a bonny wee clock
To help me tell the time
It waken me every morning
With a very poetic rhythm
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
I married a lass, a bonny wee lass
And kept her many a-year
Come what may, she began every day
By whispering in my ear
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Some can lie as long as they like
They’re luckier man than me
I never get to lie very long
I’m only 5 foot 3
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
I’ll look for work tomorrow
If you just let me sleep todayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream
Sing with me, I'll sing with you, and
So we will sing together (x3)
Sing with me, I'll sing with you and so we will sing together
As we march along
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hooorah!
After singing this song for about 20 years, we began to wonder…
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hooorah!
Walk with me, I'll walk with you, and
So we will walk together (x3)
Walk with me, I'll walk with you, and so we will walk together
As we march along
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hooorah!
Dance with me, I'll dance with you, and
So we will dance together (x3)
Dance with me, I'll dance with you, and so we will dance together
As we march along
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hooorah!
Drink with me, I'll drink with you, and
So we will drink together (x3)
Drink with me, I'll drink with you, and so we will drink together
As we march along
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hooorah!
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria
We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hooorah!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I thought I heard the captain say
Pay me my money down
Tomorrow is our sailing day
Pay me my money down

Oh, pay me, oh, pay me. Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail. Pay me my money down
Now as soon as that boat was clear of the bar
Pay me my money down
Well, he knocked me down with the end of a spar
Pay me my money down

Oh, pay me, oh, pay me. Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail. Pay me my money down
I wish I was Mr. Howard's son
Pay me my money down
Sit in the house and drink good rum
Pay me my money down

Oh, pay me, oh, pay me. Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail. Pay me my money down
Well, I wish I was Mr. Steven's son
Pay me my money down
Sit on the bank and watch the work done
Pay me my money down

Oh, pay me, oh, pay me. Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail. Pay me my money down
Oh, pay me, oh, pay me. Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail. Pay me my money downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
As I was out ridin' one mornin' for pleasure
I spied a young cowboy a-ridin' along
His hat was throwed back, and his spurs were jinglin'
And as he was ridin' he was singin' this song

Whoopee, ti-yi-yo, git along, little dogies
It's your misfortune, ain't none of my own
Whoopee, ti-yi-yo, git along, little dogies
You know that Wyomin' will be your new home

When spring comes along we round up the dogies
We stick on their brands, and we bob off their tails
Pick out the strays, then the herd is inspected
And the very next day we go out on the trail

Whoopee, ti-yi-yo (Whoopee, ti-yi-yo), git along, little dogies
It's your misfortune, ain't none of my own
Whoopee, ti-yi-yo, git along, little dogies
You know that Wyomin' will be your new home

We ride on the prairies across the wide rivers
And on through the flats where there's never a town
Our horses are weary, we're tired and we're hungry
Lay still, little dogies, stop roamin' around
Whoopee, ti-yi-yo (Whoopee, ti-y-yo), git along (git along), little dogies (little dogies)
It's your misfortune, ain't none of my own
Whoopee, ti-yi-yo, git along, little dogies
You know that Wyomin' will be your new home

Night is a-comin', and the dogies are strayin'
They're farther from home than they've been before
Come on, little dogies, it's time to be rollin'
When we get to Wyomin', we'll roll no more

Whoopee, ti-yi-yo (Whoopee, ti-yi-yo), git along (git along), little dogies (little dogies)
It's your misfortune, ain't none of my own
Whoopee, ti-yi-yo, git along, little dogies
You know that Wyomin' will be your new home

Whoopee, ti-yi-yoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've traveled around this country
From shore to shining shore;
It really made me wonder
The things I heard and saw
I saw the weary farmer
Plowing his sod and loam;
I heard the auction hammer
Just a-knockin' down his home
But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the farmer sweated for
I saw the weary miner
Scrubbin' coal dust from his back;
And I heard his children crying
"We've got no coal to heat the shack."
But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the miner sweated for
I saw the seaman standing
Idly by the shore;
And I heard the owner sayin'
"Got no work fer you no more."
But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the seaman sweated for
I see my brothers working
Throughout this mighty land
And I pray we'd get together
And together make a stand
Then we'd own those banks of marble
With a guard at every door
And we'd share those vaults of silver
That we have sweated forEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We are trav'ling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
And we'll all be reunited
On a new and sunlit shore
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh Lord how I want to be in that number
When the, saints go marching in
And when the sun begins to shine
And when the sun begins to shine
Oh Lord, how I want to be in that number
When the sun begins to shine
Oh, when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh, when the trumpet sounds the call
Lord, how I want to be in that number
When the trumpet sounds the call

Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new one is revealed
Oh, when the new one is revealed
Oh, when the new one is revealed
Oh Lord, I want to be in that number
When the new one is revealed
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Lord how I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching inEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ring-a-lets)
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind)
As I cruised out one evening upon a night's career
I spied a lofty clipper ship and to her I did steer
I heisted out my signals which she so quickly knew
And when she saw my bunting fly she immediately hove to-woo-woo
(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ring-a-lets)
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind)
I took her for some fish and chips and treated her so fine
And hardly did I realize she was the rovin' kind
I kissed her lips, I missed her lips and found to my surprise
She was nothin' but a pirate ship rigged up in a dis-guy-eye-ise
(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-eye-eye)
And her hair hung down in ring-a-lets
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind)
So, come all ye good sailor men who sail the wintry sea
And come, all ye apprentice lads, a warnin' take from me
Beware of lofty clipper ships, they'll be the ruin of you
For 'twas there she made me walk the plank and pushed me under, too-ooh-ooh
(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ring-a-lets)
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but)
One of the rovin' kind (yo-ho!)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
