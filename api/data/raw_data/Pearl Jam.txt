Hey, hey, yeah, uh

Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Mm, and all I taught her was everything
Mm, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
Mm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be, yeah
Mm, mhm, oooh

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?
Ooh, ah yeah, ah, ooh
Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo, doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo
Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo, doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo
Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo, doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo
Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo, doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo

At home drawin' pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a "V"
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Clearly, I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget? And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard

Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Try to forget this (Try to forget this)
Try to erase this (Try to erase this)
From the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today

(Spoke in, spoke in)
(Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in, spoke in...)
(Spoke in, spoke in)

Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah
On a weekend wanna wish it all away
And they called and I said that I want what I said
And then I call out again
And the reason, oughtta leave her calm, I know
I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag

Oh yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know I don't want to stay
Make me cry


I see
I don't know, there's something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh, I said, I don't, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag
Oh yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way
And I know and I know I don't want to stay, oh

Freezin'
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin'
Maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh yeah
Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, oh yeah
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy he looks insane, hm yeah

Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again...

Kneelin'
Looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, oh yeah
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin'

Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
...Ah, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away

Come on, just some spare change, man, I know you got
Well, God bless you, man, God bless you

Waitin', watchin' the clock
It's four o'clock
It's got to stop
Tell him
"Take no more"
She practices her speech as he opens the door
She rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over

She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Oh

Talking to herself
"There's no one else who needs to know"
She tells herself
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew him, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man

She loved him, yeah
She don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah
That's why she'll be back again

Can't find a better man (Can't find a better man)
Can't find a better man (Can't find a better man)
Can't find a better man (Can't find a better man)
Can't find a better man11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Alone, listless
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violence
Center of her own attention
The mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above
Oooh ooh

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go go...go19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation

Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before

The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
That's not a negative thought
I'm positive, positive, positive
Falling down, not staying down
Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before

Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor
We're stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Couldn't lift up the forget-me-nots
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world

I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
(I know the girls wanna dance away their circumstance)
(I know the boys wanna grow their dicks and fix and file things)
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight up ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"Hold me, darling, just a little while"
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Ooh, ooh-ooh21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What they've taken is more than a vow
They've taken your innocence
And then they throw em on a burning pile

All along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"

I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience!
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me want to cry
Ah ah ay ay

All along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

And all along they're saying
Mind your manners
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like your living hell?
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like your living hell?
Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like your living hell?11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I seem to recognize your face
Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away

I swear I recognize your breath
Memories, like fingerprints, are slowly raising
Me you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see

I just want to scream, "Hello
My god, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are, and here I am"
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade...10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
