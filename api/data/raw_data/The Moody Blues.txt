Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed, with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, I love you

Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through, they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be, you will be in the end

And I love you
Yes, I love you
Ah, how I love you
Ah, how I love you


Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Breathe deep the gathering gloom
Watch lights fade from every room
Bedsitter people look back and lament
Another day's useless energy spent
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one
Lonely man cries for love and has none
New mother picks up and suckles her son
Senior citizens wish they were young
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion?
 
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war
'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in its greed
(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the wall of love is for
It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be
And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you
I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me through
Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me
But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose
I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls
It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war
When we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in it's greed
(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah
Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
 
I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see

When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground
And angry voices carry on the wind
A beam of light will fill your head
And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known
Another man is what you'll see
Who looks like you and looks like me
And yet somehow he will not feel the same
His life caught up in misery
He doesn't think like you and me
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see


When all the stars are falling down
Into the sea and on the ground
And angry voices carry on the wind
A beam of light will fill your head
And you'll remember what's been said
By all the good men this world's ever known
Another man is what you'll see
Who looks like you and looks like me
And yet somehow he will not feel the same
His life caught up in misery (Melancholy man)
He doesn't think like you and me (A very lonely man)
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see

I'm a melancholy man (When all the stars are falling down)
That's what I am (Into the sea and on the ground and angry voices carry on the wind)
All the world surrounds me and my feet are on the ground
I'm a very lonely man (A beam of light will fill your head)
Doing what I can (And you'll remember what's been said by all the good men this world's ever known)
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see

(When all the stars are falling down)
I'm a melancholy man
(Into the sea and on the ground...)
That's what I am
(And angry voices carry on the wind)
All the world surrounds me
(A beam of light will fill your head)
I'm a very lonely man
(And you'll remember what's been said)
Doing what I can
(By all the good men this world's ever known)
All the world astounds me and I think I understand
(Another man is what you'll see)
That we're going to keep growing
(Who looks like you and looks like me)
Just you wait and see
(And yet somehow he will not feel the same)
Oh, believe me, believe me, believe me
(His life caught up in misery, he doesn't think like you and me)
I'm a melancholy man
 
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow - white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion
Pinprick holes in a colourless sky,
Let insipid figures of light pass by
The mighty light of ten thousand suns
Challenges infinity and is soon gone
Night time, to some a brief interlude
To others the fear of solitude
Brave Helios wake up your steeds
Bring the warmth the countryside needs
 
Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh


I'm looking at myself reflections of my mind
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love
If you'll just come with me you'll see the beauty of
Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon

Tuesday, afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh
 
Dawn is a feeling, a beautiful ceiling
The smell of grass just makes you pass into a dream
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years, if you want it to

You look around you, things they astound you
So breathe in deep, you're not asleep, open your mind.
You're here today
No future fears
This day will last
A thousand years, if you want it to

Do you understand that all over this land there's a feeling?
In minds far and near, things are becoming clear with a meaning

Now that you're knowing, pleasure starts flowing
It's true, life flies, faster than eyes could ever see
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years, if you want it to
 
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Reflected in your eyes

I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

Once the world was new
Our bodies felt the morning dew
That greets the brand-new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away

I wonder if you care
I wonder if you still remember
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours
Love was all we knew
And all I knew was you

I wonder if you know
I wonder if you think about it
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams


And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
And when the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Mirrored in your eyes

I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
 
Part I: Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)

Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh


I'm looking at myself reflections of my mind
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love
If you'll just come with me you'll see the beauty of
Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon

Tuesday, afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh

Part II: (Evening) Time To Get Away

Evening has come to pass
The time of day doesn't last
Evening, has earned its place today
I'm tired of working away

Working, living, it brings
Only way to have those things
Toiling has born too many tears,
Turn 'round all those past years

Evening time to get away
Evening time to get away
Evening time to get away
'Til next day

Live all you people, you can see where you're at
It doesn't really hurt you, so it can't be bad


Live all you people, you can't see where you're at
It doesn't really hurt you, so it can't be bad

Evening time to get away
Evening time to get away
 
Timothy Leary's dead
No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in
Timothy Leary's dead
No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in
He'll fly his astral plane
Takes you trips around the bay
Brings you back the same day
Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary
Timothy Leary's dead
No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in
Timothy Leary's dead
No, no, no, no, he's outside looking in
He'll fly his astral plane
Takes you trips around the bay
Brings you back the same day
Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary
Along the coast you'll hear them boast
About a light they say that shines so clear
So raise your glass, we'll drink a toast
To the little man who sells you thrills along the pier
He'll take you up, he'll bring you down
He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground
He flies so high, he swoops so low
He knows exactly which way he's gonna go
Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary
He'll take you up, he'll bring you down
He'll plant your feet back on the ground
He'll fly so high, he'll swoop so low
Timothy Leary
He'll fly his astral plane
He'll take you trips around the bay
He'll bring you back the same day
Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary
Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary
Timothy Leary
 
Evening:


When the sun goes down, and the clouds all frown
Night has begun for the sunset
See it with your eyes, Earth's re-energized
By the sun's rays everyday
Take a look out there, planets everywhere

When the sun goes down, and the clouds all frown
Night has begun for the sunset
Shadows on the ground, never make a sound
Fading away in the sunset
Night has now become day for everyone

I can see it all, from this great height
I can feel the sun, slipping out of sight
And the world still goes on, through the night


Twilight time, to dream awhile
Unveils a deepening blue
As fantasy strides, over colourful skies
The form disappearing from view

In twilight time, dream with me awhile

A nightingale plays a dark mellow phrase
Of notes that are rich and so true
An aerial display by the firefly brigade
Dancing to tunes no one knew

In twilight time, dream with me awhile
In twilight time, dream with me awhile

Building castles in the air
Whistling to the wind
As nature bows down her head
See what tomorrow brings


In twilight time, dream with me awhile

Bats take to wing like puppets on string
Prancing through cool evening air
In a sightless glide, no reason to hide
From the ray of the sun's blinding stare

In twilight time, dream with me awhile
In twilight time, dream with me awhile
 
Balloons flying, children sighing
What a day to go kite flying
Breeze's cool, away from school
Cowboys fighting out a duel

Time seems to stand quite still
In a child's world it always will

Fishes biting, so exciting
Lunchtime sounds so inviting
Angler Bill, he gets a thrill
Sitting, watching bobbing quill

Time seems to stand quite still
In a child's world it always will

Yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's sighs
Watch children play, they seem so wise


Mary Green, today's a queen
While thousand dollies are a dreaming
Cotton frocks and golden locks
Her palace is an orange box

Time seems to stand quite still
In a child's world it always will
 
Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should have been
For goodness' sake what's happening to me?

Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

It was cold outside my door
So many people by the score
Rushing around so senselessly
They don't notice there's people like me

Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

They don't know what they're playing
No, they've no way of knowing what the game is
Still they carry on doing what they can

Outside me, oh politely, dear diary

It's over, will tomorrow be the same?
I know that they're really not to blame
If they weren't so blind then surely they'd see
There's a much better way for them to be

Inside me, yours truly, dear diary

Dear diary, it was cold today
But the sun came out later
So I went out and strolled about looking at the shops
Didn't really see anything I liked
So I didn't buy anything
On the way home, I posted a letter
Been quite a nice day
Somebody exploded an H-bomb today
But it wasn't anybody I knew
 
Part 1
Now you know that you are real
Show your friends that you and me
Belong to the same world
Turned on to the same word
Have you heard?
Now you know that you are free
Living all your life at ease
Each day has its always
A look down life's hallways, doorways
To lead you there
(The Voyage)
Part 2
Now you know how nice it feels
Scatter good seed in the fields
Life's ours for the making
Eternity's waiting, waiting
For you and me
Now you know that you are real
Show your friends that you and me
Belong to the same world
Turned on to the same word
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
 
{Instrumental Lead In}
I'm just a wandering on the face of this earth
Meeting so many people
Who are trying to be free
And while I'm traveling I hear so many words
Language barriers broken
Now we've found the key
And if you want the wind of change
To blow about you
And you're the only other person to know, don't tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
A thousand pictures can be drawn from one word
Only who is the artist
We got to agree
A thousand miles can lead so many ways
Just to know who is driving
What a help it would be
So if you want this world of yours
To turn about you
And you can see exactly what to do
Please tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
How can we understand
Riots by the people for the people
Who are only destroying themselves
And when you see a frightened
Person who is frightened by the
People who are scorching this earth
I'm just a wandering on the face of this earth
Meeting so many people
Who are trying to be free
And while I'm traveling I hear so many words
Language barriers broken
Now we've found the key
And if you want the wind of change
To blow about you
And you're the only other person to know, don't tell me
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
{Instrumental}
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
How can we understand
Riots by the people for the people
Who are only destroying themselves
And when you see a frightened
Person who is frightened by the
People who are scorching this earth
Music is the traveler crossing our world
Meeting so many people bridging the seas
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
We're just the singers in a rock and roll band
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band...
{Instrumental ending}
 
I see it all through my window it seems
Never failing, like millions of bees
Pull out the drawer, no time to be won
Only to do, what can be done?

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day, one hour a night
Sees crowds of people, oh-oh-oh
Home, in full flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

It makes me want to run out
And tell them, they've got time
Take a step back out and look in
I've found out, I've got time


Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day, one hour a night
Sees crowds of people, oh-oh-oh
Home, in full flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour
