There is a time for love and laughter
The days will pass like summer storms
The winter wind will follow after
But there is love and love is warm
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new the world is free
There is a time when leaves are fallin'
The woods are gray the paths are old
The snow will come when geese are callin'
You need a fire against the cold
So do your roaming in the springtime
And you'll find your love in the summer sun
The frost will come and bring the harvest
And you can sleep when day is done
 
Dooley was a good ole man
He lived below the mill
Dooley had two daughters
And a forty-gallon still
One gal watched the boiler
The other watched the spout
And mama corked the bottles
And ole Dooley fetched 'em out
Dooley slippin' up the holler
Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley give me a swaller
And I'll pay you back someday
The revenuers came for him
A-sippin' though the woods
Dooley kept behind them all
And never lost his goods
Dooley was a trader
When into town he'd come
Sugar by the bushel
And molasses by the ton
Dooley slippin' up the holler
Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley gimme a swaller
And I'l pay you back someday
I remember very well
The day ole Dooley died
The women folk weren't sorry
And the men stood round and cried
Now Dooleys on the mountain
He lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him
And a barrel for his stone
Dooley slippin' up the holler
Dooley try to make a dollar
Dooley gimme a swaller
And I'll pay you back someday
 
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
While I was praying, somebody touched me
While I was praying, somebody touched me
While I was praying, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
Well, it was on a Sunday, somebody touched me
It was on a Sunday, somebody touched me
It was on a Sunday, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me
Must have been the hand of the lord
 
Ol Reuben made a train & he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my ran it to the Lord knows where
Should been in town when Reuben's train went down
You could hear that whistle blow 100 miles
Oh me, oh my you could hear the whistle blow 100 miles
Last night I lay in jail had no money to go my bail
Lord how it sleeted & it snowed
Oh me, oh my Lord how it sleeted & it snowed
I've been to the East, I've been to the West
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh me, oh my I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh the train that I ride is 100 coaches long
You can hear the whistle blow 100 miles
Oh me, oh my you can hear the whistle blow 100 miles
I got myself a blade, laid Reuben in the shade
I'm startin' me a graveyard of my own
Oh, me, oh lordy my, startin' me a graveyard of my own
Ol Reuben made a train & he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my ran it to the Lord knows where
 
Now Ebo Walker was born in Kentucky, and raised by his daddy on a hillside farm
He took up fiddle playing just for fun, that's the last work Ebo Walker done
Well Ebo Walker left Kentucky
Cause Ebo's daddy said durn your hide
You won't plant corn, and you won't make hay
You sit on the porch and play that thing all day
Well Ebo Walker, he walked and he fiddled and he walked and he fiddled and he drank till he died
But I've heard tell when the winds are down and the moon shines bright, and the leaves are brown
You can hear old Ebo Walker all around
 
It's been ten long years since I left my home
In the hollow where I was born
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
And the foxhunter blows his horn
I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill or two
What have they done to the old home place
Why did they tear it down
And why did I leave the plow in the field
And look for a job in the town
Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away
Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I've lost my love I've lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead
 
Now come all ye hunters who follow the gun
Beware of your shooting at the setting of the sun
For Polly's own true love he shot in the dark
But oh and alas Polly Vaughn was his mark

For she'd her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn

He ran up beside her and saw that it was she
Cried, "Polly oh Polly have I killed thee?"
He lifted up her head and saw that she was dead
And a fountain of tears for his true love he shed

For she'd her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn

In the middle of the night Polly Vaughn did appear
Cried, "Jimmy oh Jimmy you must have no fear;
Just tell them you were hunting when your trial day has come
And you won't be convicted for what you have done"

For I'd my apron wrapped about me and you took it for a swan
Oh and alas it was me Polly Vaughn

In the middle of the trial Polly Vaughn did appear
Crying, "Uncle oh Uncle Jimmy Randall must go clear"
The lawyers and the judges stood around in a row
In the middle Polly Vaughn like some fountain of snow

For she'd her apron wrapped about her and they took her for a swan
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn
 
Same old man sitting at the mill
The mill turns around of its own free will
Hand in the hopper and the other in the sack
Ladies step forward and the gents fall back
Down sat an owl and he said all quiet
Lonesome day and a lonesome night
Thought I heard a pretty girl say
Court all night and you sleep next day
Well then, said the raven as she flew
If I was a young one I'd get two
One for to fetch and the other to sew
I'd have a string for my bow, bow, bow
My old man's in Kalamazoo
He don't give no "yes, I do"
First to the left and then to the right
This old mill grinds day and night
 
Well, I had an old dog and his name was Blue
Had an old dog and his name was Blue
Had an old dog and his name was Blue...
Betcha five dollars he's a good dog too...
"Here old Blue"
"Good dog you"
Well, I shouldered my axe and I tooted my horn
Went to find 'possum in the new-grown corn
Old Blue treed and I went to see
Blue had 'possum up a tall oak tree
Mmm, boy I roast'd 'possum, nice and brown
Sweet po-ta-toes, n' all a-round...
And to say "Here old Blue (here-boy)
You can have some too"
Now, Old Blue died and he died so hard
Made a big dent in my back-yard
Dug his grave with a silver spade
Lowered him down with a link of chain
Ev-er-y link I did call his name...
Singing "Hereâ€¦old...Blue-ue...
"Good dog you"
Now, when I get to heaven, first thing I'll do
When I get to heaven, first thing 'awm do
When I get to heaven first thing I'll do
Pull out my horn and call old Blue...
I'll say, "Here Old Blue come-on dog"
"Good dog you."
I'll say, "Here Blue-e"
"I'm a coming there too"
"Down boy... good dog"
 
It got Old Joe Wiggins while returnin' a glance
Out to Bessiemae Hootin pa's place
About a mile out of town on the West Plains Road
He disappeared without a trace
They discovered his teeth, when the County Police
Made an investigation of the case
And Cousin Belle Simmons said that Sheriff Cartwright
Had the strangest look on his face
It was the biggest whatever that anybody ever saw
It was covered with fur and come a-rollin' in from Arkansas
It was 40 feet high, a gleam in its eye
And a picturfull patch on its craw
It was the biggest whatever that anybody ever saw
I saw old man Huntsel, who's a hundred and four
Yesterday at Ida Jaffet's house
He said it's much bigger now than when it carried off my cow
But it's not enough to worry about
He said, "Back before the war there were a whole lot more
But they never came this far south
He said, "I don't mind seein' one from time to time
But I hope it's not its regular route
It was the biggest whatever that anybody ever saw
It was covered with fur and come a-rollin' in from Arkansas
It was 40 feet high, a gleam in its eye
And a picturfull patch on its craw
It was the biggest whatever that anybody ever saw
 
She sang hymns out of tune
And carried the yellow balloon
She traded her love for a Spanish doubloon
And talked to the people, the people who are
I have a clock on the wall
It keeps time and that isn't all
It tells me how long she's been gone
Gone to the people, the people who are
She lived in a sorcerer's room
She pounded the table and brandished the broom
She turned ten thousand when she touched the moon
And turned to the people, the people who are
The rain came and scattered away
The old antique caretaker's children at play
Early this morning, she passed away
Passed to the people, the people who are
She sang hymns out of tune
And carried the yellow balloon
She traded her love for a Spanish doubloon
And talked to the people, the people who are
She sang hymns out of tune
 
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Oh, falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
 
The October leaves
They whisper in lemon chimes
And ring autumn's bells
That glisten in colors rhymes
And sings simple songs of love
That echo from other times
They write no words between the lines
The cloud ships that soar
And raise high above the shore
Upon sails of fire
To sunset's cathedral doors
Not to die with the day that's past
Or to cry for what's past before
They follow the sun for one day more
When yesterday's clown
Who weeps when the curtains down
Sees the circus has gone
And tomorrow's another town
Your kingdoms will have no rings
To wear all your paper crowns
You'll fall but my ear will hear no sound
Tomorrow I'm gone
I'll leave you alone with your fears
I'd rather move on
And you'd rather hide behind tears
You cry in the starlit nears
But you run when the rainbow appears
So we'll walk other days our separate ways
 
Turn around
Don't whisper out my name
For like a breeze it might stir a dyin' flame
I'll miss someone if it eases you know
So close the door lightly when you go
Take your tears to someone elses eyes
They're made of glass and they cut like wounding lies
Memories are drifting like the snow
So close the door lightly when you go
Who was the one who wasted time
Who was the one who stole my mind
Who was the one who made me feel unkind
So fare thee well sweet love of mine
Don't look back to where you once had been
Look straight ahead if you're walking in the rain
And find a life if the path is dark and cold
And close the door lightly when you go
 
Little Pete was just kid
Who live around the corner of the street
Levi jeans and jellyâ€…beans
Andâ€…a great bigâ€…smile
For everyone heâ€™d meet
He read comicâ€…books
And distant longing looks
They payed him when they passed
They would always wonder
Why he always looked so peaceful
So they asked

Heâ€™d tell them try to see
The things that children see
An unsophisticated lifeâ€™s
A great philosophy
They would smile
Through frowning eyes
And make their way
With thoughts of him in mind
Wishing they could be like him
And laugh and Smile
Without a thought of time
Little Pete is just a lesson
That we all should try to understand
Remember that heâ€™s always by the corner
Of our life to give a hand

Heâ€™d tell them try to see
The things that children see
An unsophisticated lifeâ€™s
A great philosophy
Little Pete is just a lesson
That we all should try to understand
Remember that heâ€™s always by the corner
Of our life to give a hand
 
Way down yonder in the forks of the branch
Way down yonder in the forks of the branch
The old sow whistles and the little pigs dance
Groundhog, groundhog
Well come on grandpa get your dog
Come on grandpa get your dog
We're going up the holler to catch a groundhog
Groundhog, groundhog
Well yonder comes Jimmy with a ten foot pole
Yonder comes Jimmy with a ten foot pole
Twist that groundhog out of his hole
Groundhog, groundhog
Well come on Pappy bring your gun
Come on Pappy bring your gun
We got that groundhog on the run
Groundhog, groundhog
Well yonder comes Sally with a snicker and a grin
Yonder comes Sally with a snicker and a grin
Groundhog grease all over her chin
Groundhog, groundhog
