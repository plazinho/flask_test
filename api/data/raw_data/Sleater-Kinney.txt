In one more hour, I will be gone
In one more hour, I'll leave this room
The dress you wore, the pretty shoes
Are things I left behind for you

Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (You never wanted to let it let it go)

If you could talk, what would you say?
'Fore you things were just night and day
Take off the dress, take off the face
I'll hold you close before I leave

Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (It's so hard for you to say goodbye)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (You need a little bit, just a little more time)

Don't say another word
About the other girl
Don't say another word
About the other girl

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (Never wanted to let it, let it go)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
My baby loves me, I'm so happy
Happy makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a TV
TV brings me closer to the world

My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day

My baby loves me, I'm so hungry
Hunger makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a donut
The hole's the size of this entire world

My whole life
Looks like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Looked like a picture of a sunny day

My baby loves me, I'm so angry
Anger makes me a modern girl
Took my money, I couldn't buy nothin'
I'm sick of this brave new world
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I spend the afternoon in cars
I sit in traffic jams for hours
Don't push me, I am not OK
The sky is blue most every day
The lemons grow like tumors, they—
Are tiny suns infused with sour

Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent

The only substance is the fog
And it hides all that has gone wrong
Can't see a thing inside the maze
There is a bridge adored and famed
The Golden spine of engineering
Whose back is heavy with my weight

Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent
Be still this old heart
Be still this old skin
Drink your last drink
Sin your last sin
Sing your last song
About the beginning
Sing it out loud
So the people can hear, let's go
Be still this sad day
Be still this sad year
Hope your last hope
Fear your last fear
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one, let's go

My falling shape will draw a line
Between the blue of sea and sky
I'm not a bird, I'm not a plane
I took a taxi to the Gate
I will not go to school again
Four seconds was the longest wait

Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longestEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!

Atomic tourist
A life in search of power
I found my test site
I made a ritual of emptiness

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!

We walk to walk off
The edge of my own life
Doom Town, a bright flash
My body is a souvenir

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It took so long for me to see it
Hope’s a burden or it sets you free
Wandered through the void of you
Wandered through the void of me
I’ve grown afraid of everything that I love

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It's not the weather, it's the people we love!7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out my head
What do you want, what do you know?
One to get started, three till we go

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

What do you want, what do you know?
Do you get nervous making me go?
Get into your sores, get into your things
Do you get nervous watching me bleed?

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin
I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows
Oh, God, let me in, there's nowhere else to go
Oh, God, let me in, and let me go, go, go, go

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skinEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Every day I throw a little party
But a fit would be more fitting, fitting
And every time I climb a little higher
Should I leap or go on living, living?
Hear the voices venomous and thrilling
In my head they're always calling, calling
But I wanna gotta go the way my blood beats
So I'm not fodder for their folly, folly

No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity

Let's destroy a room with this love
We can drain out all the power, power
Steal from the makers who unmade us
Leave them nothing to devour, devour

Well I am raw material
Make me plastic, make me fuel
I can be, I can be
I can be all
No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore
It's better than before

We can drown in mediocrity, it feels sublime
One, two, three!
It feels like someone pushed rewind
One, two, three!
Give it to me easily, my feeble mind needs time
One, two, three!
Make it sweet and syrupy with rhyme
Don't drag me down
I'm not falling down
Don't drag me down

I'm a bubble in a sound wave
A sonic push for energy
Exploding like the sun
A flash of clean light hope
All you scientists can hold your breath
Can I decide to show myself, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(Take me to the source of chaos let me be the butterfly
Oh my, imperfect symmetry has underlying poetry in rhyme)
If you think like Thomas Edison
Could you invent a world for me
Now all that's on the surface
Are bloody arms and oil fields
Could I turn this place all upside down
And shake you and your fossils out, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(You can't predict everything with Newton like certainty, why
Oh my, coz it floats around all we see with oscillating energy on high)
And you soothe yourself with the sounds you know
You tune out out out the hypnotic drone
Perfect hexagon of the honeycomb
And you soothe your soul with the shapes you know
Should I come outside and run your cars
Should I run your rockets to the stars
Could you invent a world for me
I need to hear a symphony
If I'm to run the future
You've got to let the old world go, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(Take me to the source of chaos let me be the butterfly

And you soothe yourself with the sounds you know
You tune out out out the hypnotic drone
Perfect hexagon of the honeycomb
And you soothe your soul with the shapes you know
Your word for me is fusion
But is real change an illusion
Could I turn this place all upside down
And shake you and your fossils out
If I'm to run the future
You've got to let the old world go
Could you invent a world for me
I need to hear a symphony, oh oh

On the day the duck was born
The fox was watching all along
He said, "Land Ho!" when he saw the duck
"Land Ho!" and the duck saw him too
"Shiny Pretty Fox," thought the duck
The duck came up onto the land
The fox was watching and he just laughed
"I could show you some shiny tricks," he said
"Come along we'll get our kicks," he said
"Land Ho!" for shiny tricks
"Land Ho!" for me
"Oh Fox! Is this love? Can you tell me? What is love?"
That good looking fox only knew one trick
He could break hearts just lickety-split
The duck knew this game she had to quit
And her own pond she was headed too quick
"I'll go I'll go and there's no looking back"
Goodbye, little fox
Goodbye, my foxEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's fine when it's all mine
It's on my wall, it's in my head
Memorize it 'til I'm dead
It's yours, now, I'm so bored

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Joey Ramone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pictures of me on your bedroom door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Invite you back after the show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the queen of rock and roll

I just don't care
Are you that scared?
I swear they're looking right at me
Push to the front so I can see
It's what I thought
It's rock and roll

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Thurston Moore
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wrestle on your bedroom floor
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Always leave you wanting more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw away those old records
Go downtown
Put on your best frown
Give me a chance
I know I can dance

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Joey Ramone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pictures of me on your bedroom door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Invite you back after the show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm fine 'cause it's all mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
