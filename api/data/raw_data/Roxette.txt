I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away, and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye


And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before, uhh
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (Take a listen to it)
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye


Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart (Uhh, take a listen to it, ha-ha-aa)
Listen to your heart (Take a, take a listen to it)
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
 
It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard
Winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
(Must have been love)

But it's over now
(It's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows


It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

(Must have been love)
It must have been love
But it's over now
No, no, no
 
In a time
Where the sun descends alone
I ran a long, long way from home
To find a heart that's made of stone
I will try
I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes
Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
Tell me why
When I scream there's no reply
When I reach out there's nothing to find
When I sleep, I break down and cry (cry) yeah
Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go (can't let go)
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
Fading like a rose
Fading like a rose
Beaten by the storm (storm)
Talking to myself, getting washed by the rain
It's such a cold, cold town
Ooh such a cold town
Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go (can't let go)
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a
Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go (can't let go)
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower (flower)
Oooh...
Ooohooh... (Every time you leave the room)
I feel I'm fading like a flower (Every time I see you)
Oooh I'm fading like a rose
(Every time you leave the room)
Every time I see you (Every time I see you)
(Every time you leave the room)
 
One, two, three, four

Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look
Heavenly bound
'Cause heaven's got her number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a color
Her lovin' is a wild dog

Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look
Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
And kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look

Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
You pack your bag
You take control
You're movin' into my heart
And into my soul
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I won't be walking on thin ice
To get through the night
Hey, where's your work?
What's your game?
I know your business
Don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
You turn around
So hot and dry
You're hidin' under a halo
Your mouth is alive
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I'm not attracted to gogo
Deeper tonight
Hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business
But I don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
Hey, hey, hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business
But I don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's armed and she's extremely dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
Oh, oh oh, hey, where's your work?
Mmm, what's your game?
I don't know your name
Hey, you!
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
I don't know your name
 
C'mon, join the joyride, everybody
Get your tickets here
Step right this way

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need a book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune

And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride

She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no

Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride
She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride."
Be a joyrider, ow


I'll take you on a sky ride
I'm feeling like I'm spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby

She says, "Hello (hello) you fool (you fool) I love you (I love you)
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride
Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
Join the joyride
Hello, hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon, c'mon join the joyride
Be a joyrider
Roxette
 
What's the time? Seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on, but the only thing showing is a picture of you

Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
I thank the Lord above that you're not here to see me
In this shape I'm in

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time

I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please, is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I'm spending my time (spending my time)
Watching the sun go down (I fall asleep)
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a Clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

My friends keep telling me, "Hey, life will go on"
Time will make sure I'll get over you, ooh
This silly game of love - you play, you win only to lose
Ohuhohuhoh

I'm spending my time (spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time (spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "Tears of a Clown"
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

(Spending my time)
I can't live without your love
(Spending my time)
Uh, I'm spending my time, my time, my time
Bed's too big without you honey, honey
(Spending my time)
 
I see you comb your hair and gimme that grin
It's makin me spin now, spinning within
Before I melt like snow, I say hello
How do you do!
I love the way you undress now, baby begin
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines through
How do you do!
Well, here we are, crackin' jokes in the corner of our mouths
And I feel like I'm laughin' in a dream
If I was young, I would wait outside your school
'Cause your face is like the cover of a magazine
How do you do the things that you do?
No-one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye, bye, bye?
I see you in that chair with perfect skin
Well, how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know did you say hello? How do you do?
Well, here we are, spending time in the louder part of town
And it feels like everything's surreal
When I get old I will wait outside your house
'Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal
How do you do the things that you do?
No-one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye, bye, bye?
 
I'll tell you what I've done
I'll tell you what I'll do
Been driving all night just to get close to you
Baby babe, I'm moving so fast
You'd better come on
The moon is alright
The freeway's heading south
My heart is going "boom!"
There's a strange taste in my mouth
Baby babe, I'm moving real fast
So try to hold on
Yeah, try to hold on!

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car
Making up, oh oh ...

So come out tonight
I'll take you for a ride
This steamy ol' wagon
The radio is getting wild
Baby babe, we're moving so fast
I try to hang on
I try to hang on

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car
Making love, oh yea!
Sleeping in my car, I will possess you
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you
Laying in the back seat of my car
Making up, oh oh ...

The night is so pretty and so young
The night is so pretty and so young
So very young ...

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car
Making love ... to you!
Sleeping in my car, I will possess you
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you
Laying in the back seat of my car
Making up, making love ...

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car
The night is so pretty and so young
Yeah
 
Must have been love
But it's over now
Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away
It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard Christmas Day
I dream away
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love, but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows
(Must have been love) It must have been love
But it's over now
No, no, no
 
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Tried to make it little by little
Tried to make it bit by bit on my own
Quit the job
The grey believers
Another town where I get close to the bone
Whatcha gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
Whatcha gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...
I'm gonna get dressed for success
Shaping me up for the big time, baby
Get dressed for success
Shaping it up for your love
No No No
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I'm not afraid
A trembling flower
I'll feed your heart and blow the dust from your eyes
And in the dark things happen faster
I love the way you sway your hips next to mine
Whatcha gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
Whatcha gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...
I'm gonna get dressed for success
Shaping me up for the big time baby
Get dressed for success
Shaping it up for your love
LOOK SHARP!
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Whatcha gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
Whatcha gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...
Dressed for success
I'm gonna get dressed for success
I'm gonna get dressed for success
Hitting a spot for the big time, baby
Get dressed for success, shaping it up for your love
For your love
Yeah Yeah Yeah
For your love
Yeah Yeah Yeah
For your love
Yeah Yeah Yeah
For your love
Yeah Yeah Yeah
 
Everywhere I look I see her smile
Her absent-minded eyes
And she has kept me wondering for so long
How this thing could go wrong
It seems to me that we are both the same
Playing the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable, and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
Days like these no one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There's nothing words can say
She's colored all the secrets of my soul
I've whispered all my dreams
But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart, yeah
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt someone I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
Don't hide your eyes...
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She's all I've got
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt someone I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
She's so vulnerable
My Baby, She's vulnerable
She's so vulnerable
