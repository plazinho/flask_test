Say my name, say my name if no one is around you

Say my name, say my name if no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you,” if you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name, you actin' kinda shady

Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? (Another lady)

Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday? (Yesterday)

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me

Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name (Say my name) if no one is around you

How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, sayin' you gotta bounce (Bounce)
When two seconds ago, said you just got in the house (The house)
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself (By yourself)
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel (Feel) you gotta lie? (L-Lie)
Gettin' caught up in your game, when you cannot say my name (Say my, say my name)

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems

At first, we started out real cool
Takin' me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doin' those things you did no more
You're slowly makin' me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car (Car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me and
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get yo' check next week

You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (Do, do, do)
So, you and me are through (Ooh)
Now you've been maxing out my cards (Card)
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But you're steady headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetratin' to your friends like you be ballin'
And then you use my cellphone (Phone)
Callin' whoever that you think's at home
And then, when the bill comes
All of a sudden, you be actin' dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills? (Pay my bill)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?

Do you pay my automo' bills? (Bills)
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do (Oh, no no, no no)
So, you and me are through

You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Oh-ooh no, no)
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another? (No no, no no, no no, no no)
You triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Good for nada, hey)
Oh silly me, why haven't I found another?

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did, then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?

Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyonce, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this (Woo)

Better move, 'cause we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
Baddest chick, chick in sight
DJ, jam tonight
Spotted me, a tender thang
There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna dance with me?
Can you handle, handle me?

You gotta do much better
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully, if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (Hey)

'Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya, babe

Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this (Woo)

I'm about to break you off
H-town goin' hard, read my hips
Slap my thighs, swing my hair
Squint my eyes
Lookin' hot, smellin' good
Groovin' like I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder, I blow you a kiss
Can you handle, handle this?
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya, babe

Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground
I can't help but wonder why
'Cause my vibe's too vibealacious for you babe

I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz

Pa pa de do da-de
Pa pa de do da-de do
Pa de-de oh
Pa de-de oh
Pow pow pow pow
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (I don't think)
I don't think you're ready for this jelly (You're ready)

Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

It's over and done, but the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to instead of me tonight?

And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know, there's no—
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight, goodnight)
(Goodnight)
I'm there at your side, apart of all the things you are
(Ahh-ah, ahh-ah)
But you gotta find some one else
You gotta go find your shining star

And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
(Taking me over)
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody left in this world
Goodnight
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
(Don't you know I'm lost without you baby)
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
(Yeah, nobody, nobody to hold me)
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
(Nobody to kiss me, yeah)
Goodnight, goodnight6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't makin' it easy

But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes, but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm tellin' you
Girl, I can tell you been cryin' (We understand)
And you're needin' somebody to talk to (Don't be ashamed, I'm your friend)

Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you (I know what you're feelin', girl)

Remember the first day when I saw your face?
Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me, and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies, although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night

The way we held each other's hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an argument?
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games?
Remember the first day you fell in love with me?
It felt so good for you to say those words
'Cause I felt the same way too

The way we held each other's hands
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
And I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh, oh

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so
I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby, now that you're a part of me
You've shown me, shown me the true meaning of love (The true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so

He looks at me and his brown eyes tell it so5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
