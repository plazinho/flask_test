Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', "50, you hot" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)

Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
"Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up"
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs

New York City
You are now rappin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?

Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, he coming
(*nine gunshots*)
Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say "Only God can judge me," ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
"Hommo" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me121EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P (P!)
I don't know what you heard about me (Woo!)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Me)

I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, Shorty)

I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo!)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Huh-uh)

But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Yeah)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

Yeah, in Hollywood they say, "There's no b'ness like show b'ness"
In the hood they say, "There's no b'ness like ho b'ness", you know?
They say I talk a little fast, but if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch

My, yeah, yeah, mmm
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to
I'm a writer, I'm a fighter, entrepreneur
Fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver—what's it to ya?
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (Yeah!)
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'
Up! You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute
Yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', "Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!"
‘Cause this is all I know
This is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble
Oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch)
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers
I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic
It's sad, it's never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick

Girl, what we do (What we do)
And where we do (And where we do)
The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?

Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Stripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Lady, she gon' hit my line

Bad bitches around, they smoking and they drinking
And I'm thinking it can all work out
Seen your bitch back blown out
It's never nothing personal, believe me

She talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town
Not around, she want me to fly in to put it down
It's nothing to a real nigga, had that ass flying in first class
'Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular
Turn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass
You know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it

Yeah, uh-huh
They don't do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)

I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I’m used to the bullshit, it don’t matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So which you want, the cheese or the cheeks
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I’m havin’ the epiphany you niggas ain’t shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I’m from
I’m a Southside nigga, yeah I’m ‘bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain’t made of what I’m made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, her shoes come from Bakers
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?

We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot

We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!
Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast
D colored VS stones around my neck bitch
It feels like a nigga dreamin’
Seat back, music bumpin’, niggas leanin’
Bulls eye, that’s what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game boy
I should’ve sent the broad to report what’s in the yard
Aloof livin’, I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it’s embedded in the brain
I’m in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame

We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop
Y’all don’t do it how we do
Niggas ain’t on the shit we on (we on, we on)
Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)
We up, nigga!

‘Round the world tourin’, the city got boring
Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans
Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange
Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses
Living life with no worries
My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus
Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e
M-Zone Rida Gang end the story
Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry
She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury
Everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring
Purple label Ralph Lauren, kick game like Atari
You so special, bedroom or restroom
Just keep performing, go girl
About to film a movie, guess who's starring41EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape
(I've waited
I've waited
Time went by
But all I could do is cry
Silly, silly)

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend

Woo! Yeah

And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't no friend of mine (Yeah!), you ain't no kin of mine (C'mon!)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9? (Uh-huh)
We do this all the time (What?), right now we on the grind (Yeah)
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes (Uh-huh)
Shorty, she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo!)
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
The D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar (Uh-huh)
Nigga, you play with my paper, you gon' meet my Beretta
Now Shorty think I'ma sweat her (Uh-huh) sippin' on Amaretto (Yeah)
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two-step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'

Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy

By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they gon' murk 50, how?
We ridin' 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider, then they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in "New Jack," I holla "Cancel that bitch!"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty "BS" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, "Look at Niggaraci" - hello
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes they moving seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the ball or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ohh!

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, "Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang."
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Man 1 : Aye, you want some of this shit?
Man 2 :  Naw, I don't want that shit
Man 1 :  I don't give a fuck. I don't play that shit, and I'm finna' buss a cap in a nigga
Man 2 : Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. I'ma get in the other car. Aight
Car revs up
Gunshots

If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

Keep thinking I'm candy 'til ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying "Lord, Jesus help me" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun till you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
'Cause I get tired of looking for ya
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me (best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me (testing me)
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me (blessing me)
Finna run rap 'cause Dr. Dre got the recipe (recipe, recipe)

Yeah, ha ha, aye Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
'Cause the windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof, nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit, I might get a fucking concussion
But better that than a hole in the head right, nigga? Ha ha ha ha24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Yeah
Haha, yeah
Yeah

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)

I apply pressure to pussies, they stunt and I pop (Yeah)
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I got 'em (Uh-huh)
Now, Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop nines (Brrat!)
Tell niggas, get they money right, 'cause I got mine (Uh-huh)
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine (Woo)
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump—is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga—I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga—that's what I'm about
Gangsta! You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yeah)

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now, I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)
I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth, so smack him (Woo)
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him (Yeah)
React like a gangsta, or die like a gangsta for acting (C'mon)
'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking, "What happened?"
Oh no, look who crept in with the .44
Twenty-inch rims sitting on low-pros (Uh-huh)
Eastside, Westside, niggas know, yo, I'm loco (Yeah)
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit! (Yeah) We get it popping in the hood
G-Unit! (Yeah) Motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act (Uh-huh)
I had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking it's all rap
Till that ass get clapped and Doc say, "It's a wrap"
It's a wrap, nigga

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now, I'ma let the champagne bottle pop (Uh-huh)
I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)

I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go ahead, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner (Ahh)
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty, dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, you heard me? (Yeah)
When the streetlights come on, niggas blast the nines (Uh-huh)
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time (Woo)
In the game there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Unh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am; you can like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done (Haha)
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top (Yeah)

Ha ha

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must cease existing, little nigga, now listen
Your mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase 'em
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha ha, pussy
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

"The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja little punk ass thinking out loud
Southside 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys saying "50 we feeling you, mane"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

I ain’t gonna' tell nobody you pussy
I ain’t gonna' tell nobody you getting extorted
I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The 50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life
But you done heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, nigga
(They not gon' like you)
I know, I know

Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffrey
Okay, just first of all, they do not know that I am a 12 degree pink belt
Okay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay, cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?
Okay, I thought so
Cause you know I know karate, and I will see him
And I will Jet Li his ass, hitaaaah!36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
G-Unit (Bo!), we in here (Bo!)
We could get the drama popping, we don't care (Bo! Bo! Bo!)
It's going down (Bo!), 'cause I'm around (Bo!)
50 Cent, you know how I gets down, down

What up, blood? (What?)
What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?

They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto, in a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might wanna play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get nothin' with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)
D's come, we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle
Blood (What?)
What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?

We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around

I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)

Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to workin' that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

I step up in the club I'm like "Who you wit?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit
This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like "Oh man"
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit
Baby you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
