Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?
 
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs


But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile
 
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go?

You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again

You used to get it in your fishnets
(Falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(You took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
(You were just sounding it out)
Is anything as pretty in the past though?
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
(You're not coming back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
(Oh...)
 
Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
An' a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
An' I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
An' when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
An' her lips are like the galaxy's edge
An' her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

(That's magic) In a cheetah print coat
(Just a slip) Underneath it, I hope
(Asking if) I can have one of those
(Organic) Cigarettes that she smokes
(Wraps her lips) 'Round a Mexican Coke
(Makes you wish) That you were the bottle
(Takes a sip) Of your soul, an' it sounds like


Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
 
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you’ll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathin' in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
 
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)
 
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"High, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?"
 
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain’t it funny what you’ll do?

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Knee socks
Knee socks
 
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah

The look of love, the rush of blood
The "She's with me"s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the color dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah
 
Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five
 
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, "Long Hot Summer"
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
Yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
It's the star treatment
The star treatment
 
What's been happenin' in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
But it don't sound much like you, girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind? (Snap out of it)
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it
 
Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?
 
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just post-mix lemonade

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go, go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you
 
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"
 
One for the road, oooh oooh
One for the road, oooh oooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling
Don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
 
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning


Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying
 
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down
The barrel of a gun, and it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train and then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
Oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do


So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Oh, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
 
I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?


Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here

Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river, going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all
 
Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (Stop)
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland
Say, "Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

I fantasise, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (Stop)

Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought
