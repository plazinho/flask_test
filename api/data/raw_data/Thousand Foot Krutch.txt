I am not afraid
Of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and

I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us

I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
I’m just a speck inside your hand
You came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began so clearly

I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me
Something I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

And we’re all see through, just like glass
And we can shatter just as fast
That light’s been burned out for a while
I still see it every time I pass
It was lost in the corners of my mind
Behind a box of reasons why
I never doubted it was there
It just took a little time to find and even when

I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me something
I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
 
It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend your locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid

Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

This is a warning, like it or not
I break down, like a record spinning
Gotta get up
So back off
This is a warning, like it or not
I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)

Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know anymore
Thought I had, thought I had it under control
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Here it goes, hear it (1, 2, 3, 4!)

It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control

You try to move, try to move, try, but don't wanna lose
You so afraid, so afraid, you don't want it to fade
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Let it go, let it (1, 2, 3, 4!)

It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control


(1, 2, 3, 4!)
It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control
 
The other night
I had a dream
There was a world full of kings and queens
But it was cold
Dark as the night
We were the fire under moonlit skies
We were divided
We were the same
And we were free
But we all wore chains
We couldn't see it
But we created
A place between truth and overrated

If I could just see it all
Just like a fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore
Like nothing never happened
Haven't seen you before?

I'm on the run from a thief
I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared
When I turn and shout:

I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe

We had a plan to build a wall
A great divide that would never fall
To separate us
From all the pain
And keep the skeletons locked away
And brick by brick
We built it so thick
That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight
And one by one
We all became numb
We were making the bullets to a broken gun

If I could just see it all
Just like the fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore
Like nothing never happened
And I haven't seen you before?

I'm on the run from a thief
I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared
When I turn and shout:

I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe

I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe
 
Hold on for a second
If words can be weapons
Then what I say can affect it
They're not just words on a record
And I can choose to respect it
Or choose to infect it
But once that hits the water
It's too late to be selective

If one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart

So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cuz light shines brighter in the dark

When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road

So hold on for a moment
If we're not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it
We just plant the seed and keep groanin'
And when that light shines in the mornin'
They'll still be wakin' up yawnin'
We'll be smilin' like we expected
Sweet victory, one method

'Cause one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief, one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart

So stand up, shout it out
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let's make it count
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out
And before we depart let's leave a mark
'Cuz light shines brighter in the dark

When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road

And I can choose to respect it
Or choose to infect it
But once that hits the water
It's too late to be selective
If one voice is enough
To make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up
And watch whole nations stand up
It's one belief one spark
One faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart
Before it all falls apart

When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road
When we scream
Our lips don't make a sound
We march with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go
On this untraveled road
On this untraveled road
On this untraveled road
 
I'm an alien
Cause I'm not of this world
I have a name
But I've been changed, and now I can't stay the same
And I'm a loser if that means I've been lost before
But now I found it, I'm surrounded
Cause you can hear the way it sounded

Like angels singing with a million voices

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin

I'm a monster if that means I'm misunderstood
Cause its alive and I can't hide it
The energy is rising
And I'm a traitor if that means I've turned on myself
I can't deny it, it's like a riot
And I can't keep it quiet

Like angels singing with a million voices

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin

Hear me running
Hear me running, running
Hear me running, hear me running, ra-running
Hear me running, hear me

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin
 
Hahaha
Let the sparks fly
Hahaha

There's no such thing as maybe
Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy
I'm just tired of waiting
Let the sparks fly baby

Give me one if it's real
And two if you can feel it
Give me three signs that you're awake
It only takes one spark
For two to fall apart
And three more to blow it away
Give me ONE if it's real
And TWO if you can feel it
Give me THREE signs that you're awake
It only takes ONE spark
For TWO to fall apart
And THREE more to blow it away

There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride
Cause heaven's not far away
And I'm not gonna leave you here

Burn it like it's fading
No more hesitating
Let the sparks fly baby
Drive it like ya race it
You can call me crazy

Give me one good reason
Two more to believe in
And three shots at why I should wait
Cause I got one more match
Two strikes left
You got 'till three to get out of my way
Give me ONE if it's real
And TWO if you can feel it
Give me THREE signs that you're awake
It only takes ONE spark
But TWO to fall apart
And THREE more to blow it away

Let me take you into the light
There's nowhere to hide
There's nothing but darkness left here
Shake it off and let's take a ride

Cut me like those words you throw
Console me when you want control
Roll me in those lies you've told
But I won't play these games no more and

(Don't run and hide, stand up and fight)
I'm feeling like just letting go
(It's shaking your mind with cause and divide)
It's taking everything I know
(Don't run and hide, stand up inside)
The wheels keep burning
I'm about ready to blow

When I get angry, I feel weak
And hear these voices in my head
Telling me to fall beneath
'Cause they'll make everything okay
How did I get here?
Everything's unclear
I never meant to cause you pain
Give me a reason I can believe in
I need it all this time
Send me a lifeline

Wave if it makes you look good
Smile when you feel like you should
It's hard not to treat this like I could
Heaven help me, it's overwhelming

(Don't run and hide, stand up and fight)
I'm feeling like just letting go
(It's shaking your mind with cause and divide)
It's taking everything I know
(Don't run and hide, stand up inside)
The wheels keep burning
I'm about ready to blow

When I get angry, I feel weak

I know they say that the space between
Can make it stronger then we've ever seen
They might be right, but I disagree
'Cause I've never felt stronger than when you're with me

Sometimes I wonder why you even care
'Cause even when I leave you're always there with me
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...

I've stood alone and I've fallen down
Your hands were there to pick me off the ground
Sometimes I cry 'cause I can't believe
Your love is big enough to cover me

Sometimes I wonder if you're even there
But when I feel far away you need me there
And like a candle makes a brighter place
This mark you've made on me can't be erased
Yeah...

I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...
I wanna be so far gone in you
So far nothing else will ever do
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you... I wanna be lost

I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
I wanna get lost in you
Underneath your sky
I wanna be lost in you
Like a ship in the night
So far gone tonight

I wanna be so far gone in you (Tonight)
So far nothing else will ever do (Tonight)
I wanna be so far gone in you
In you...

So far gone in you
In you...
In you...
So far gone in you
 
I'm not the same as yesterday
Ooh... It's hard to explain
How things have changed
But I'm not the same as before
And I know there's so much more ahead
I can barely believe that I'm here
And I won't surrender quietly
Step up and watch me go

Break down, ya really want it?
Wanna make a scene?
Show me what ya mean
Let's get it started
Let me see whatcha got
Can ya take it up a notch?
Don't think you got it
Can't handle the pressure?
Get, off, stop talkin' about it
Gotta make this count, let's go

When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created

I can feel the storm
The winds have changed
Ooh... ‘Cause we're worlds a part
But just the same
But we won't leave the way that we came
And I know there's so much more ahead
I can barely believe that we're here
We won't surrender quietly
Step up and watch it go

Break down, ya really want it?
Wanna make a scene?
Show me what ya mean
Let's get it started
Let me see whatcha got
Can ya take it up a knotch?
Don't think you got it
Can't handle the pressure?
Get, off, stop talkin' about it
Gotta make this count, let's go

When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created
Are you ready? Are ya ready?
Are ya ready for me?
Are you ready? Are ya ready?
Are ya ready to see?
 3x
When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created
 
I won't maintain, insane, get it up
You always play the blame game, no shame, had enough
I don't wanna maintain, insane, get it up
You always play the blame game, no shame, had enough

Fresher
Like it's the 1st semester
Rock it like Queen when I'm under pressure
While the rest of these cats, all siesta
I get loose like change when it's on your dresser
Boom, here comes the real volume
Loud enough to wake up and shake this tomb
I connect like skate decks in concrete rooms
You're about to face what makes this move

People used to tell me that I'm on my own
They said I'd never make a difference on this microphone
'Cause there's a million other people who could sing this song
I said "Well, thanks for the push 'cause you all were wrong"

You wanna try to take me under
I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder
You can't break me
You'll never take me down

Explosion
Dig it like rust corrosion
When it goes in gush like a busted nose and
Competitors
I was born to set it off
They wrapped me in cloth
I grabbed a mic and went on tour
Smash it
Back in school I was a hazard
Cause I never saw the grass
Never just looked past it
Had a passion that burned like battery acid
Peter Parker, bit by some radioactive
(Shake this place in)

People used to tell me that I'm on my own

I'll never bow till I'm six feet under
Listen to the sound of rolling thunder

If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free
(Feel the movement, feel the pressure)
If you wanna rise up start with me
If you wanna stand up here's one for free

Tired of being ordinary
Don't care if there's people staring

They say heaven is a place where
Our pain is washed away
With no room for all the torment
Of choices that we've made
I'm a broken man saved by grace
Tossed alone inside this maze
And I am just a question
To the answer you convey

You've been all the way to broken
Lost your sense of where to go
Your love is still the answer
More than hate will ever know
It's not too late to be rescued
Not too late to let it go
Remember pain is just an anchor
You never had control of
You give us life and meaning
You give us hope, so

If I can be honest
How come I always break my promises to you
If I'm not afraid why am I so scared to move
I'm barely breathing
And if I can be honest
How come I always end up so far away from you
You made me a promise
And I'll always hold it true

I believe heaven is a place where
We'll walk the streets of gold
She's seen nothing but the concrete
Yeah the world has left her cold
She's been beaten, bruised, and broken
She's felt pain instead of love
Inside she was an angel
But she never knew she was

You've been all the way to broken
Lost your sense of where to go
Your love is still the answer
More than hate will ever know
It's not too late to be rescued
Not too late to let it go
Remember pain is just an anchor
You never had control of
You give us life and meaning
You give us hope, so

If I can be honest
How come I always break my promises to you
If I'm not afraid why am I so scared to move
I'm barely breathing
And if I can be honest
How come I always end up so far away from you
You made me a promise
And I'll always hold it true
(Always hold it true)

If I can be honest
How come I always break my promises to you
If I'm not afraid why am I so scared to move
I'm barely breathing
And if I can be honest
How come I always end up so far away from you
You made me a promise
And I'll always hold it true
(Always hold it true)
 
Oh, I could be nice
But don't test me
I can get wicked

I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I'm a beast, came to rip this spot up
Stick to Cons 'cause the devil wears Prada
We want peace, but we can make this rowdy
Stop, we don't wanna hurt nobody
You can't hang me 'cause my nature's nice
And my heart's for the people of the world tonight
If you got a problem with it, take it up with life
'Cause if you try to push me it, ain't gonna be nice

I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I am not afraid
Of this mountain in my way
You can push me to my knees, I believe
And I am now awake
Uncontrolled and unashamed
When it washes over me, I feel free

P.S., don't play me like a 3DS, these cats can't see us
They're checking the wrong mirrors, cavaliers
Don't mistake kindness for weakness
They never wanted to hear us blowing speakers
Spinning the trinity, hook, line and sequence
In your brain like a G6, no secrets
My faith's my life, it's rolling the dice
If you try to push me, it ain't gonna be nice

I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked

I am not afraid
Of this mountain in my way
You can push me to my knees, I believe
And I am now awake
Uncontrolled and unashamed
When it washes over me, I feel free
Go!

Oh, I can be nice
Don't test me

I get wicked, wicked
I get wicked, there's no escaping it
Wicked, you wanna kick it?
Watch me get wicked
Step up and get it
'Cause I get

I get wicked when you come against me
So quit it, stop trying to push me around
Let's kick it if you really wanna touch fire
Come get it, step up, I'll bring you down
(Ha-ha-ha, think I'm not going to defense? You're crazy)
Step up and get it
'Cause I get wicked
 
We've got the fire, who's got the matches
Take a look around at the sea of masks and
Come one, come all, welcome to the grand ball
Where the strong run for cover and the weak stand tall
I'm not one to scatter ashes
But there's some things that'll melt the plastic
Try and dig down deeper if you can
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
We've got the power, who's got the action
Break it down till there's nothing but a mere fraction
Out of the fire, rise from the ashes
Reject your doubt and release the passion
Let's get on it, believe if you want it
Step into the realm where the real ones flaunt it
Come back, rewind, another time on it
Reach out, take that, but now step on it
I'm not one to scatter ashes
But there's some things that'll melt the plastic
Try and dig down deeper if you can
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not one to scatter ashes
But there's some things that'll melt the plastic
Try and dig down deeper if you can
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
 
These waterfalls I've seen a million times
They wash away the world that I've seen covering up my mind
And I can push the walls away until they're out of sight and mind
But I'm not strong enough to stand alone here in this tide

I don't want you, I'm not trying
I wish it would just go away
And then I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red

These situations make me feel so cold
It's like I've been replaced by someone I don't know
And I can't say the words until I've said all that I can say
But without you I'm a fraction of who I'm supposed to be

Breathe me in and take me under
Crack these walls and let's start again
And then I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red
I see red... I see red

We can run we can hide, we can live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us
We can love we can hate, we can live without it
We're not alone, there's more than this
(2x)

There's nothing left, but the sound of my heart
There's nothing left, but the strings on this guitar
Take it all, take the hurt and heartache
Help me start again
(2x)

We can run we can hide, we can live without it
It's the same in us, it takes the blame in us
We can love we can hate, we can live without it
We're not alone, there's more than this
(2x)
 
I think I'm ready
I think I've got it
Cause too much thinking is bad for my health
It's like a fire
Cause when I start it, I can't control it and I burn myself
But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it, no one will

We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one

My heart is racing
Just like a rocket
Victory looks like a distant dream
Cause what we're fighting
Not gonna stop it
But we can beat it if we just believe
I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it, no one will

We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one

We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one
But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it, no one will

We are the ones
We are the guns
And we will ride
We are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change
We are the chains that hold us
We are the choice
We are the strong
We are one
 
I can be stupid, but not outrageous
I can be sickness, but not contagious
I can be empty, but I'm not nameless
It's the way that you love me, the way that you love me
I can be patient, but I'm not waiting
I can be shook up, but I'm not shaking
I can be angry, but I'm not jaded
It's the way that you love me, the way that you love me

I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
(Cause I am)

Running with giants everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go

I can be outraged, but not a traitor
I can be distant, but I'm no stranger
I am a target, but without danger
It's the way that you love me, the way that you love me
I can be strong, but not without weakness
I can be helpless, but not defeated
I can be cut deep, but I'm not bleeding
It's the way that you love me, the way that you love me

I am not alone here
I'm not on my own here
I am not alone
I'm not on my own
(Cause I am)

Running with giants everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go
 X2
I feel the pressure of 10 men when the floor cracks and the walls start movin' in
I feel the strength that's from within
Kickin' down the doors and walls, we're comin' in

Running with giants everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go
I've been running with giants everywhere I go
It's an unspoken alliance
So I can just let go

There’s nothin’ that can stop it
Until we’re in the coffin
If you want it, we got it
So let’s get it started
