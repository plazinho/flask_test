Oh, when the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
Mmm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Oh, I know (Oh, I know)
That the music's fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing (Yes, I know)
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much
You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks (You can dance)
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ooh
Doop doop, doop doo doop
Ooh
Doop doop, doop doo doop
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those treetops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow
Then, I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells all the way

(Up on the roof)
(Up on the roof)

When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face (Up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space (Up on the roof)
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustlin' crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)


At night, the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you-a
Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Everything is all right (Up on the roof)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Movin' on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where she is bound?
I broke her heart
And made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do? What can I do?
(There goes my baby) Whoa
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa
(There she goes) Yeah (There she goes)
I wanna know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing
Me for a fool?
I wonder why she left me
Why did she leave me
So all alone
So all alone?
I was gonna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side
To be my guide
I wanna know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)

This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

Oh (magic)
Oh (magic)
Mmm (magic)
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment

They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway (On Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (On Broadway)
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (on Broadway)

They say the girls are something else
On Broadway (On Broadway)
But looking at them just gives me the blues (On Broadway)
'Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime?
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (On Broadway)

Ha! They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway (On Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say (On Broadway)
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (On Broadway)

Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are

I'll be a big, big, big man (On Broadway)
I'll have my name in lights (On Broadway)

Oooooooooo yeah yeah
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All it had to take me was just one look
My heart began a thumpin'
Babe you had it jumpin'
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night stand
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took
You're more than a number
Written in my little red book
Oh baby give us a chance
Don't let the small town rumours
End our first real romance
Now I admit I've loved a few
But there was never one like you
So Darlin, dont believe the things that they say
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All it had to take me was just one look
My heart began a thumpin'
Babe you had it jumpin
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night stand
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took
You're more than a number
Written in my little red book
Oh baby
You gave me a sign
I threw away the numbers
Of those old flames of mine
And now they're tryin' to put you whilst
Knock me down in my girls eyes
Oh Darlin, Dont believe the words that they say
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All it had to take me was just one look
My heart began a thumpin'
Babe you had it jumpin
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night stand
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took
You're more than a number
Written in my little red book
Whoooo ooooo
You're more than a number in my little red book

You're more than a one night stand

Well, Saturday night at eight o'clock
I know where I'm gonna go
I'm a-gonna pick my baby up
And take her to the picture show
Everybody in the neighborhood
Is dressing up to be there, too
And we're gonna have a ball
Just like we always do
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Well, there's Technicolor and Cinemascope
A cast out of Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's always lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sitting by my side
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Oh, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Whoa, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Yeah, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Wonderful wonderful
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
Some kind of sweet lips
Some kind of warm eyes
Some kind of soft sigh
There's only some kind of wonderful
Oh yeah wonderfulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
