There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one92EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Instrumental Intro
Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you, oh
Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
Oh, yes I know it
(Yeah) And I've been workin' too, baby
(Yeah) Every night and day
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
'Cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
I know he's been workin' so hard
(Yeah) Every day, baby
(Yeah) Whoa, ohhh...
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you
Somewhere, baby
Somehow I know it, baby
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you
Believe me, baby
I know it, baby
You know it too2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's a hard world to get a break in
All the good things have been taken
But girl there are ways
To make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags
I'll wear sable
Someday
Hear what I say
I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent
Sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose
It ain't no use
Holdin' me down
Stick around

But baby, baby
Remember, remember
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But, some day, I'll treat you real fine
There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry
When I'm squeezing them dry?
Taking all I can get
No regrets

When I
Openly lie (ha)
And live on their money
Believe me honey
That money
Can you believe?
I ain't no Saint
No complaints
So girl throw out
Any doubt

And baby, baby
Remember, remember
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day, I'll treat you real fine
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
Don't push me
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
It's my life
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
And I can do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
You can't tell me
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
I'm gonna do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
{Intro}
The rooms were so much colder then
My father was a soldier then
And times were very hard
When I was young
When I was young
I smoked my first cigarette at ten
And for girls, I had a bad yen
And I had quite a ball
When I was young
{hook}
When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young
I met my first love at thirteen
She was brown and I was pretty green
And I learned quite a lot when I was young
When I was young
{Bridge}
When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young
My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in fellow men
And I was so much older then
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young

He blesses the boys as they stand in line
The smell of gun grease
And the bayonets they shine
He's there to help them all that he can
To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
He smiles at the young soldiers
Tells them it's all right
He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight
Soon there'll be blood and many will die
Mothers and fathers back home they will cry
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile
The order is given
They move down the line
But he'll stay behind and he'll meditate
But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate
As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
In the words that he said
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
{Instrumental}
You're soldiers of God, you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell
In the morning they return
With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words
"Thou shalt not kill."
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
Servin' my time doin' the best I can
Walls and bars they're surroundin' me
But I don't want your sympathy
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I just need your tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burnin' oven
When my time is up be my rebirth
Like Adam's worth on God's green earth
My rebirth, my rebirth
Baby, yeah, mean it's my rebirth, yeah
Yeah, (Yeah!), yeah (Yeah!)
Yeah, (Yeah!), yeah (Yeah!)
Yeah, baby (Yeah!), baby (Yeah!)
Come on (Yeah!), come on (Yeah!)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, (Yeah!), yeah
Ice cold water runnin' in my brain
Then they drag me back to work again
Pains and blisters on my minds and my hands
From livin' daily with those canvas bags
Thoughts of freedom they're drivin' me wild
And I'll be happy like a newborn child
We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
No more walls keep your love from me
Yeah!
Can't you feel my love
Baby (Baby!), baby (Baby!)
I need you (Baby!), squeeze you (Baby!)
Yeah, come on (Baby!), nobody but (Baby!)
You do (Baby!), I love you (Baby!)
Need you, alright
I said everything's gonna be alright
And if you don't believe what I say just
Just listen, baby
Can't you feel my love?
Can't you see my skill
Can't you yell my love?
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
A little closer, yeah
I said, baby (Baby!), I need you (Baby!)
Come on (Baby!), squeeze (Baby!)
Please (Baby!), oh! (Baby!)
Lord, I love you (Baby!), I need you (Baby!)
Yeah, yeah
Right by my side
I need you here by my side
But I can't help it, baby
But I'll be home soon
I'll be home soon
Yeaheah
Alright

(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She walks by, the men folk stand in rows
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She winks her eye, the bread slice turn to toast
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She's got a lot of what they call the most
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
The girl can't help it she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if I go to her on my bended knees
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
'Cause I'm hopin' obviously
That someday her answer will be
The girl can't help it 'cause she's in love with me
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She'll mess around with every mother's son
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If I give her good loving she says "baby well done"
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She'd make my grandpa feel like twenty-one

Well, here comes the night
Its dark shadows passing over me
I've been feeling the chill
Ever since you been gone
I'm thinking of you, girl
Wondering if you're going
To return to me
Or was it a waste of time
All we've been through
When I'm all alone
I don't have someone I can run to
Baby, I ain't got no place to go
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone
We could start again
If only you would
Reach out and touch me, baby
Like a blind man
I feel you deep down inside
I'm over the edge
I'm sorry I hurt
You so badly, girl
The things that I said
Just cannot be denied
When I'm waiting here
Hoping that someday you'll
Return to me cause, baby
Feel like I'm losing control
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone
My mind's running wild
I feel like a child
Who's been lost again
You've stolen my heart
Captured my soul
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
It keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) Keeps
Getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn
Yeah, the night, the night
(Keeps moving on)
Yeah, colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) it keeps
Getting colder and colder
The night, keep moving on
(Pray for the dawn) keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, it's always too longEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky too is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue
Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start a new
And it's all over now, baby blueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
