Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence
 
Can you feel that?
Ah, shit
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes, violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream...
And when I dream!

No, Mommy, don't do it again!
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, I promise!
No, Mommy, don't hit me!
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me!
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch!
Fuck you! I don't need this shit!
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore!
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die!

Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over me
 
He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation, I cannot forget

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

When you die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die, you'll know why
You'll die, you'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die, you'll know why

I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
 
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run!

You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a blood stained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
Don't want to mention

The reason I know
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go
Yes, I am stricken and can't let you go
 
Devon won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul about to be mine again
Leave her, we will receive her
It is beyond your control will you ever meet again
Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again

Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Sever, now and forever
You're just another lost soul about to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all if you'd like to meet again
Fire for your desire
As she begins to turn cold for the final time
You will shiver, 'til you deliver
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again

Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Take me away, yeah

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again man
 
The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you can rise again
So don't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?

I won't give up, so don't give in
You've fallen down, but you will rise again
I won't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Don't let it take your soul
Look at me, take control
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight
 
Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation: an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now, my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

I'll have you know that I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
My declaration embedded deep under the skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

You will be shown how I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

I'm indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I am indestructible (Indestructible)

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent had to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war
 
Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow beckoning
Then, your fear seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind
And reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer, if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you

When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light

Don't ignore, listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light
 
Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference
And gets stupified

I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
And all I needed was just one fuck
How can you say that you don't give a fuck?
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one fuck
One tiny, little, innocent fuck
And when I feel like I'm shit out of luck
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! "It's all the same", you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! I get stupified!

All the people in the left wing, rock
And all the people in the right wing, rock
And all the people in the underground, rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All the people in the high-rise, rock
And all the people in the projects, rock
And all gente in the barrio, rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! "It's all the same", you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! I get stupified!

Tefached
Tefached

And don't deny me
No, baby now, don't deny me
And darling, don't be afraid

But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified!

Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
I begin to stupify
 
Survivor
Survivor

One more goddamn day when I know what I want and my want will be considered tonight
Consider tonight
Just another day
When all that I want will mark me as a sinner tonight
I’m a sinner tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

Power unrestrained
Dead on the mark is what we will deliver tonight
Deliver tonight
Pleasure fused with pain
This triumph of the soul will make you shiver tonight
We’ll make you shiver tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and haunted behind

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

Ten thousand fists in the air
Ten thousand fists in the air
 
This is wartime, this is our time
We won't be denied
Feed the fire that is raging inside
This is go time, this is showtime
We will fight 'til their wills are broken
This is game time, an insane time
Let the madness fly
Show them strength that just can't be defied
Find the power to devour
Let the beast inside now be woken

In this world, only the strong will survive
Hear the roar and you will know you're alive
Feel the energy build in your soul
'Cause it's time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

Raw emotion, pure devotion
They will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing
Let them witness us move as one now
Show no mercy, let the world see
We’re invincible
Show them nothing is beyond our control
Take it higher, our desire
Will determine what we become now

Are you ready for the test of your life?
See the fear bleeding right through their eyes
Feel the energy build in your soul
'Cause it's time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

Feel it
Take no prisoners now
Take it
There it is, standing in front of us
Hear it
Our deliverance now
Own it
Give them all an image of us that will last for all time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die (Never die)
Be immortalized
 
Say, yes, they know that you’ve hurt yourself another time
Don’t they know that you’re full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you’ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn’t easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you’ve hurt yourself another time
Don’t they know that you’re full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you’ve hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn’t easy

Why your soul’s gone cold and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you’re one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add onto your pain and suffering
Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you, completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest, tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering
Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you, completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Return to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, leave me no one
Turn to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, cast aside
Return to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, leave me no one
Turn to me, return to me, return to me
You've made me turn away

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
They take everything from you
Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
 
What has come over me?
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away to fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, bringing a question: Why?

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night

This self-discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away to feast upon (the night)
The source of my felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away, from hibernation
Strong and unafraid, never a question why

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night

Give into the night

In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night

Night, night, night
Give into the night
Night, night, night
Give into the night
Give into the night
 
Tell me exactly what am I supposed to do
Now that I have allowed you to beat me?
Do you think that we could play another game?
Maybe I could win this time
I kind of like the misery you put me through
Darling, you can trust me completely
If you even try to look the other way
I think that I could kill this time

Rah, rah!
Rah, rah!

It doesn't really seem I'm getting through to you
Though I see you weeping so sweetly
I think that you might have to take another taste
A little bit of hell this time

Rah, rah! Lie to me
Rah, rah! Lie to me

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?

You always wanted people to remember you
To leave your little mark on society
Well, don't you know your wish is coming true today?
Another victim dies tonight

Rah, rah! Lie to me
Rah, rah! Lie to me

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?

Is she really
Telling lies again?
Doesn't she realize
She's in danger?

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?

The little bitch, she went and she told a lie
And now she will never tell another, a lie
The little bitch, she went and she told a lie
Never fucking lie to me!
 
So, are you breathing?
So, are you breathing now, now?
Are you breathing?
So, are you breathing now?

Wake up, are you alive? Will you listen to me?
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say
Wake up, are you alive? Will you listen to me?
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say!

Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing? You're making me known
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

So, what's up? I wonder, why do you listen to me?
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say
What's up? I wonder, why do you listen to me?
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say!

Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing? You're making me known
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

So!
"Can't you imagine how good
Going through this will make you feel?
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway
So, come on, be a man
And do what you are compelled to do"
Save me, God!

I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be all right
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything go
I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be all right
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything all right!

Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing? You're making me known
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

So, are you breathing?
So, do you breathe now, now?
So, are you breathing?
So, do you breathe now?
 
Listen, everyone
The time will come when all of us say goodbye
Feel that aching in your heart
Leaving you broken inside
But we're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind

So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can

Take the ones you love
And hold them close because there is little time
And don't let it break your heart
I know it feels hopeless sometimes
But they're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind

So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can

And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive

So now go do the best things in life
Bring the fight to this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Shine your light on this world while you can

And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive
 
I've begun to realize
That I'm better when I am with you
You delivered me from the pain
In my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
Till the day you arrived

Suddenly, I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
And building inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine

Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
Let it haunt me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
Were the one who resurrected
A man who had died

Your power, it gave me new life
Made me reborn and refined
Rebuilt from inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine

I never thought I would ever escape
At times, I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
Thought that I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered, now I
Owe you a debt that I can never repay
I still believe, 'cause you're mine

I'm burning inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine

I can regain control
Because you're mine
I can take over the world
Because you're mine
 
(So, what you waiting for?
So, what you waiting for?)

I have never compromised
I never gave in
And so, I have welcomed
Every challenge in my life
And I have never wandered blind
I'm led by hunger and so I
Savor every drop
Each minute I'm alive

Leave nothing left behind

So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Don't stand by and deny it
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded

Don't let them undermine
Your dreams can never be stolen
Don't leave them stagnant
Rotting on the vine
Say goodbye
To anyone who tries
To bleed you dry
You will show them
You're blessed
With an unlimited supply

Leave nothing left behind

So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Don't stand by and deny it
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded

(So, what you waiting for?)

So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Don't stand by and deny it
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded

So, what you waiting for?
So, what you waiting for?
 
Release me! Rah!

No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely
I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night’s dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
That never went away completely

How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me, ah!

Will I ever know peace of mind again?
I don’t believe it
I can’t achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
It never went away completely

Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die

In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
To let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!

Death’s images are all around again
They’re right behind me
They’re going to find me
Judgment for the immortal sin
That had enveloped me completely, ah!
I know I’ll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they’ll hear me
They don’t fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely

Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die

In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
To let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!

In the end, there will be no suffering (more suffering)
In the end, you will find out everything (not anything)
In the end, you may question your belief (what belief?)
In the end, you will realize, finally, how you were deceived
This has gone on too long (too long)
No more demonic dreams
Destroyer, come tonight
Because her memory is killing me

In asylum
(I live a lie)
I let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
For asylum
(Relive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time (without you)
This world is not fulfilling me, ah!

Don’t think I live in asylum, I live a lie
Don’t want to live in asylum, I’ll live a lie
Don’t think I live in asylum, I live a lie
