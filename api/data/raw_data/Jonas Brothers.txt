I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah

Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)

Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)

Kiss the tears right off your face
Won't get scared, that's the old, old, old me
I'll be there time and place
Lay it on me, all you're hold, hold, holding

Time, time only heals if we work through it now
And I promise we'll figure this out

I will take your pain
And put it on my heart
I won't hesitate
Just tell me where to start
I thank the oceans for giving me you
You saved me once and now I'll save you too
I won't hesitate for you

Don't you ever say goodbye
Cross my heart, and you can keep, keep, keep mine
If I could only read your mind
Then I could map out all the ways to make it right

One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, oh

He said, "I've been to the year 3000" (Yeah, yeah)
"Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine, doin' fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater" (Oh, yeah)
"And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

He said, "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"
 
Every night, every day, how about every lifetime?
Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine
'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times
Baby, save me a space in your mind, yeah

Well, call me crazy
And people saying that we move too fast
But I've been waiting, and for a reason
Ain’t no turning back

'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

That you show me (Show me, show me)
That you show me (Show me, show me)

Everywhere that I go, feeling you all around me
Now that I got you close, I'm alright
Baby, I didn't know, but I'm glad that you found me
'Cause I'm seeing the most in your eyes, oh yeah, yeah

Call me crazy
People saying that we move too fast (Too fast)
But I've been waiting for a reason
Ain’t no turning back

'Cause you show me something I can't live without (Ah yeah, yeah)
And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (When you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
I believe, I believe, I believe

That you show me (Show me, show me), you show me
That you show me (Show me, show me), you show me

Doesn't matter anymore, now I got you here with me
Nothing matters any longer, now I got you here with me
I think about you every time I, every time I lose myself again
I lose myself again

'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe
'Cause you show me something I can't live without (Oh yeah)
And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (When you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

'Cause you show me (Show me, show me)
(Show me something I can't live without)
That you show me (Show me, show me), no, no
(And I believe, I believe, I believe)

(Show me, show me)
'Cause you show me (Show me, show me)
I believe, I believe, I believe you

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah
 
I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Come on, girl

I fell (I fell) so fast (So fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels), red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh
Staring me down, I know you feel it, too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Yo, we're burning up in this place tonight
Your Brothers sing it loud (And we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (Don't try and fight it)
Big Rob's for real (And that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (And touch the floor)
(It keeps on burnin' up) more and more
I got JB with me (Laying it down)
Come on boys, let’s bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under (Yeah)
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter? (Come on, man)
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Burnin' up (Sup?), burnin' up for you, baby
 
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
Days lifted in a haze, we weren't just a phase
We weren't just pretend (Just pretend)

I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

Faith led me to the clouds, reaching for the ground
'Cause life was upside down
Now everything has changed, we found better days
But I still hear the sound

I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

Woo-ooh-ooh (Yeah, with you)
Woo-ooh (With you, with you)
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster

Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
 
Pardon my interruption
This drink's just settling in
All my reservations
A reason I don't exist
She says, "Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know it's a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon."

No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells, wedding bells, wedding bells

Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if I'm being honest
I'm hoping that I'd get caught
Showing you I'm unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June

No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells

Ah ah ah ah ah
The wedding bells
The wedding bells

No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells
The wedding bells
 
Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby, can't you see?
Now I'm—
Yeah, oh!

Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

Oh, lovebug again
 
Spending all your time with your new friends

So tired of chasing all your demons (Demons)
Oh my God

Little late if you ask me
But you know I'll come around if you ask me, ask me

Used to be the one
Used to be the one I
 
Drive me crazy, make me mental
No other buttons she can push
One second she's Miss Sentimental
Then she’s afraid she's said too much

Opposites attract and we're the livin’ proof of this
But I keep on comin' back like a magnet

'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein' her smile can get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

I put my selfish ways in boxes
And shipped 'em back to where they came
Will never let it get close to bein' toxic
And I promise I’ll never walk away

Opposites attract and we’re the livin' proof of this
But I keep on comin’ back like a magnet

'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein’ her smile can get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

Gotta learn to let the small things go
And know it's always far from perfect
And I know that we can get emotional
But the hardest parts are always worth it

'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein' her smile will get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah
Because you
Because you love her
 
Mr. Misdemeanor
Call me up and say you're needin' my love
Now you say you're leaving, oh yeah
Like you never even needed my love
Then I don't even see you (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Not even for a weekend or a month
So much you left between us (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
But you don't ever think about us (Ooh)

Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look a-, look away

Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

Yeah, I remember when we met
Like it was yesterday in Amsterdam (Smoke it up)
Making love through every season
Oh, every day, oh, every day
And I can't believe it now (I can't believe it)
You think, you think it's only physical (Oh no, no)
No good at getting even
The way you play, the way you play

Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look away

Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep on coming)
You're always on my mind (Always on my mind)
It doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep coming back to you)
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Love locked down for you

Because there's too much water
Under this bridge to go down like this
I never thought that we'd come this far
To **** it all up and e-end like this

Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do (I do)
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time
