Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

It was a month since he passed, maybe less
And no one knew what to do, we were such a mess
We were texting, we were calling, we were checking in
We said we ought to play a show in honor of our friend
Well now that show's finally here, it's tonight
Supposed to go to the bowl, get on stage, dim the lights
With our friends and our family, in his name, celebrate
There's no way that I'll be ready to get back up on that stage
Can't remember if I've cancelled any show
But I think about what I'm supposed to do and I don't know
'Cause I think about not doing it the same way as before
And it makes me wanna puke my fucking guts out on the floor
We rehearsed it for a month, I'm not worried 'bout the set
I get tackled by the grief at times that I would least expect
I know what I should be doing when I'm singing but instead
We'll be playing through a song and I'll remember in my head

Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

What they saying, I'm not raw?
What the fuck you take me for?
All the sudden you hear what I said a hundred ways before?
I been pushed, I been trapped
Drug myself through hell and back and
Fallen flat and had the balls to start it all again from scratch
How do you feel? How you doing? How'd the show go?
Am I insane to say the truth is that I don’t know?
My body aches, head's spinning, this is all wrong
I almost lost it in the middle of a couple songs
And everybody that I talk to is like, “Wow
Must be really hard to figure what to do now”
Well thank you genius, you think it'll be a challenge?
Only my life's work hanging in the fucking balance
And all I wanted was to get a little bit of closure
And every step I took I looked and wasn't any closer
'Cause sometimes when you say goodbye, yeah you say it
Over and over and over and over

Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
(Over and over and over again)
(Over and over and over again)
 
They’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

I don’t know how to warn you
For what I’m gonna say
'Cause you’re holding so tight to
What I’m taking away
I got demons inside me
So I’m faced with a choice
Either try to ignore them
Or I give them a voice

And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
You’re not gonna like where this goes

And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line

It’s not about status
We know it never was
'Cause what good is the kingdom
When you’re missing the love?
This is not a goodbye now
I’m not going away
No, I don’t have the answers
But I do have the faith

Oh, and it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
Holding back things you don’t know
And it’s keeping me up at night
Worried it’s not alright
You’re not gonna like where this goes, no

And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line

And they’ll tell you I don’t care anymore
And I hope you’ll know that’s a lie
'Cause I’ve found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line
So I’m crossing a line
 
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies
Thinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise
Tell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes
Watching as I say this and then I do that
Telling them the old words but in a new rap
Then I change my mind up and make them lose track
Shit, I'm inconsistent, I thought they knew that

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it, I know

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't
To get some-

Yeah, excuse me while I sympathize
Singing with the fat lady, tell me what's the time
You know what it is, not afraid to cross the line
Nothing is forever, don't be mad at the design
Ask me if I can, I say I don't know
And honestly I buy that I can sound cold
Still upset from shit that's 15 years old
I don't know what it takes to make me let go

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it, I know

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't


Watching as I fall, staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, never told them so
Watching as I fall, somewhere down below
Maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't

To get somewhere they won't
Get somewhere they won't
Get somewhere they won't
 
I don't have a leg to stand on
Spinning like a whirlwind, nothing to land on
Came so far, never thought it'd be done now
Stuck in a holding pattern waiting to come down
Did somebody else define me?
Can I put the past behind me?
Do I even have a decision?
Feeling like I'm living in a story already written
Am I part of a vision made by somebody else?
Pointing fingers at villains but I'm the villain myself
Am I out of conviction with no wind in the sail?
And too focused on the end and simply ready to fail
'Cause I'm tired of the fear that I can't control this
I'm tired of feeling like every next step's hopeless
I'm tired of being scared what I build might break apart
I don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start
Oh, oh
I don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start
Oh, oh

Hey Mike, uh, just calling to uh, you know, send my condolences
Hey man, it's Mark, just, um, calling to check in on you, see how you're doing
What up Mike? Just calling to see how you're doing, check in with you a little bit
Wanna obviously send my love and support and, um, just let you know I'm here for you
I know you're super busy, didn't wanna bother you, um, just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you
Give me a call back if you want, if not, I get that too, um, but I'm sure I will see you and/or talk to you sometime soon. Alright bud, hope you're hanging in there. See ya
 
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you

This is that gather 'round it and wonder where I found it
This is that wake up, make your agent have your tour re-routed
This is that drama comma pain and ain’t no way around it
'Cause somehow still it's hard to know what I can say about it
I buckled up, told myself to suck it up
I was scared to death to get up there and spill my fucking guts
I was saying pull your stupid self together buttercup
Get it crackin' Back in Black until you have 'em Thunderstruck
But

Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you

No, there's not a single thing that I can say
Not a single solitary, every meaning changes shape
Even when there's no connection back to you in any line
All of a sudden it's about you and it gets me every time but
What the fuck is left to author anyway?
When I basically been writin' since the Raiders ran LA
I'm afraid that maybe I've said everything there is to say
Maybe I should make an exit while there're ways to get away

Can't find the words to a memory
But these are just words to a melody
Find something that works, fits the symmetry
For only a quick broken remedy
And I'd give anything to choose
Pick out the words I bring home to you
How can I make do?
Put a smile on change my attitude
And even though it's not about you
Everything is all about you
All about you

Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, now
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you
 
Wanna know where I don't go
When it goes from "okay" to a "oh no"
When it goes from high five to a low blow
When it goes from all five to a solo
Lemme tell you what you don't know
I been down, so low
I was looking for something, but denying that I found it
There's an elephant sitting in the room
And I can't find another way to tiptoe around it
I been doing greater good for a long time
But I can't find any other way to give now
I been putting myself on the sideline
And it's been time so I'm saying can I live now?

There are times when I kick myself
Say I'm not sick, but I can't get well
Say I got this while I chase my tail
As if they can't tell

I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it's still there chasing me down
I'll never win the battle
Never win the battle and I should have known it by now
Just when I think I've found the end (Oh whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm going back around again (Oh whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it's still there chasing me down

Yeah, yeah
Light side's got a dark side to it
Daytime flows into night like fluid
The yin and the yang with a curved line through it
And none of it's illuminating why I do it
Maybe I didn't wanna chase what was not right
Maybe I didn't wanna face you were offsides
Thinking I was far away from a crossed line
But I was giving soft praise to a hard lie
There are things that you say and you don't say
And my tongue's gotten real tired of me biting it
'Cause I keep on following the wrong way
And time's come and I can't keep denying it

There are times when I kick myself
Say I'm not sick, but I can't get well
Say I got this while I chase my tail
As if they can't tell

I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it's still there chasing me down
I'll never win the battle
Never win the battle and I should have known it by now
Just when I think I've found the end (Oh whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm going back around again (Oh whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it's still there chasing me down

I love you, but I know I gotta let you go
Dancing with the devil 'cause she's all I've ever known
Wanted to pretend, that this time was the end
Sorry, but I guess I gotta let you down again
Again, again
Running from my shadow, now my shadow is my only friend

Running from my shadow
But it's still there chasing me down
Yeah
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it's still there chasing me down
 
I used to know where the bottom was
Somewhere far under the ocean waves
Up on a ledge I was looking down
It was far enough to keep me safe
But the ground was cracked open
Threw me in the ocean
Cast me out away at sea
And the waves are still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one’s left to answer me

My inside’s out, my left is right
My upside’s down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there’s no light
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore

I used to sleep without waking up
In a dream I made from painted walls
I was a moment away from done
When the black spilled out across it all
And my eyes were made sober
World was turned over
Washing out the lines I’d seen
And my heart is still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one’s left to answer me

My inside’s out, my left is right
My upside’s down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there’s no light

I’m a call without an answer
I’m a shadow in the dark
Trying to put it back together
As I watch it fall apart
I’m a call without an answer
I’m a shadow in the dark
Trying to put it back together
As I watch it fall apart

My inside’s out, my left is right
My upside’s down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there’s no light
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
 
I'm off of the Earth
On a ride, alone

Yeah, lift off like Virgin Galactic
My Richard’s too Branson to fuck with you bastards
Very legendary, that’s some matter-of-fact shit
You're the opposite of stars like "rats" spelled backwards
I flow poems out to Saturn and past it
Easy as a standard anti-gravity backflip
Satellite tracking can’t map out my tactics
I spit the same shit they split an atom in half with
No, it’s not what I want but it had to be
I spent six months just recharging my battery
Imagine me quitting, what a travesty that'd be
You space shuttle Challengers are nothing but tragedies
So take care on the path that you’re headed
I'm the father to your style, don’t you ever forget it
I don’t drop mics, only let it smoke where I set it
And I don’t play, even when they press it, get it?

I'm off of the Earth
On a ride, alone
I'm drifting away
Out of time, afloat
Away from the truth
Away from the night, away from the day
I'm off of the Earth
On a ride, alone

(Please brace for impact)
I must've went to space and got sent back
But I’m still intact, in fact, take a picture of me
You can see that I’m a star with your lens cracked, Supernova
In Caesar’s Palace, stuntin' on my opponents
'Cause history'll show we done been to war like Romans
Did that dance with the devil, Hell hot as a kettle
So it’s no wonder why I put this ice on all of my metal
And wear that shit like a medal, used to think I was a joker
No Jared Leto when I said I’d get us out the ghetto
Slam my foot on the pedal
Book a studio when I couldn’t afford instrumentals, fuck it, record a cappella
Flyin' coach, dreaming Coachella until they banned me
Now they like Bambi's mother - dead
I’m on to these Grammys
I’m rollin' these grams gladly, purple and green like Daphne
Shades on like Velma, hair long like Shaggy
Crushin' Addys in my water, got my voice raspy
Haven’t slept since California and that shit was last week
Paranoid when I sleep, but when I’m high, I’m happy
That’s why I need to kiss the sky when I get stuck in the valley
Lift off

I'm off of the Earth
On a ride, alone
I'm drifting away
Out of time, afloat
Away from the truth
Away from the night, away from the day
I'm off of the Earth
On a ride, alone
 
She said
This is not about a poltergeist
Not about a phantom that glows at night
But there are things we don’t know and I
Don't have another choice but an open mind, oh
And I know what they'll say
I'll try to make sense of what no one can explain
But I’ve been having dreams that after I'm awake
Play out in reality the very next day

So I play along
I nod my head when they say I'm wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side 'til the daylight comes
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I'm wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side 'til the daylight comes

And when the lights go down
I see things I can't explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts

This is not about you and me
I can't bring back how it used to be
And I know what I do believe
But I've already seen what I couldn’t see, oh

So I play along
I nod my head when they say I'm wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side 'til the daylight comes

And when the lights go down
I see things I can't explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts

And when the lights go down
Is there something in the air?
There, but never there
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts
 
What's the difference between a man and a monster?
Is it somewhere between "I can" and "I want to"
Is it somewhere between the promises I made
And the fact I couldn't see something getting in the way

I used to think that I know what I want
Never saw it coming unglued
I used to think that I know what I want
Now it's time to see if it's true

I had so much certainty
'Til that moment I lost control
And I've tried, but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep

What's the difference between a loss and a forfeit?
I tried to make it better, but I made it more sick
I tried to make it right, but now awake at night
I know reality was getting in the way

I used to think that I knew who I was
Never saw it coming unglued
I used to think that I knew who I was
Now it's time to see if it's true

I had so much certainty
'Til that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep

I had so much certainty
'Til that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep
Promises I can't keep
 
Yeah, levitatin' off the blacktop
Used to struggle getting started now, I can't stop
Used to be the quiet kid in the sandbox
Now it's “Hands up” every time that your man rocks
You oughta stop me coming in again
You mad? You thought we were synonyms?
Too bad, that's the water you're gettin' in
You're too fat for the sharks that you're swimming in
From where I'm sitting, contenders are lookin'
Like fruit spinnin' around in a blender
Hardly a snack when I'm here lookin' for dinner
I eat 'em, delete 'em, they're barely beginners
Main course is my main sport
Play major, but Minor's my main Fort
Put a chain around everything I came for
Look, but don't touch, sucker
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

Say they want respect now
Thinking they deserve to have it next now
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Believing what they're makin' up
Talking loud, but never really sayin' much
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
I been drawin' plans out
And they think I'm givin' them a handout
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Thinking they're entitled to a piece, no, I don't think so
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

Levitatin' in the blackout
Used to drink at least a forty 'fore we mashed out
Used to think that workin' forty was a max-out
Now I'm workin' even when I'm sleepin', do the math now
'Cause even when I'm sleepin', eyes keep 'em open
Stripe across 'em both the color of your hemoglobin
A huge act man like I'm known for being Logan
X-23 I’m keen to leave 'em with a femur broken
Takin' it too far, maybe
Friends like “Mike, I don't know who you are lately”
But pride and hate has made naysayers mistake me
For wasting brain space on ratings they gave me
I don't need your respect, I got history
I'm ‘81 Reagan with that nonsense, miss me
Father like Francis, Anakin or John Misty
Not to be touched, sucker
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

Say they want respect now
Thinking they deserve to have it next now
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Believing what they're makin' up
Talking loud but never really sayin' much
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
I been drawin' plans out
And they think I'm givin' them a handout
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Thinking they're entitled to a piece, no, I don't think so
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
 
You can call 'til your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now

Yeah, yeah
Run, run it back, tell 'em what I'm coming at
I was on that bullshit then, now I'm done with that
Scared of what I didn't want, scared of what I wanted
And thought that I was finished, but I hardly had begun, in fact
I'm a beast, I'm a monster, a savage
And any other metaphor the culture can imagine
And I got a caption for anybody asking
That is, "I am feeling fucking fantastic"

Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
Some days, I'm struggling for control
Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
But right now, I'm floating above it all

So you can call 'til your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now

Yeah, yeah
Come, come again, feel it when it's flooding in
Woke up knowing I don't have to be numb again
Starting line scratched out, I don't have to run again
Give-a-fucks maxed out, tell 'em I'm not coming in
I'm not present on the payroll
And you can tell me how I should do it 'cause you say so
But I'm not dancing to the rhythm you replay, no
'Cause I'm already half a million miles away, though, they know

Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
Some days, I'm struggling for control
Some days, it doesn't take much to bring me down
But right now, I'm floating above it all

So you can call 'til your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now

And I waited too long, I listened too much
You said what can't be unheard
I'm drawing a line, enough is enough
I let you have your last word

So you can call 'til your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
So you can call 'til your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now
 
I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don't know what I'm chasing
I don't know who I am

Woke up this morning holding my head
Thinking last night is one I'll regret
Washing off the bad decisions, the blurry vision
The clues that I'm still a mess
Spitting out the taste I have in my mouth
Knowing what this all is really about
Knowing there's an explanation, an expiration
I gotta figure shit out

And they're asking me if I can see
The darkness down below
And I know it's true, I say I do
When half the time I don't
Maybe I can't make what it may take
To leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes and cross each line
And every time

I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don't know what I'm chasing
I don't know who I am

Waking in the dead of night, I can't sleep
Sleeping in the light of day for like weeks
Reality was out of focus, I could be hopeless
Instead, I gritted my teeth
I didn't have the patience left to explain
Didn't wanna wait while nobody came
I know the path ahead's uneven, but while I'm breathing
I have to make my own lane

And they're asking me if I can see
The darkness down below
And I know it's true, I say I do
When half the time I don't
Maybe I can't make what it may take
To leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes and cross each line
And every time

I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don't know what I'm chasing
I don't know who I am

So, I make it up as I go, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I make it up as I go, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
So, I make it up as I go, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I make it up as I go, as I go

I keep on running backwards
I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers
I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient
My mother held my hand
I don't know what I'm chasing
I don't know who I am

So, I make it up as I go, ooh whoa, ooh whoa (As I go, as I go)
I make it up as I go, ooh whoa, ooh whoa (As I go, as I go)
So, I make it up as I go, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I make it up as I go, as I go
 
Tell all the children to lock those doors
I've seen the smoke in the sky before
Gotta be up on my feet when the morning comes
‘Cause this fight we can't ignore
I feel a chill building up inside
Seeing the sweat filling up my eyes
Tell every friend, enemy in flesh and blood
To send out the battle cry

Fingers stretching out from nowhere
Reaching for my throat
They're hungry for my skin
Teeth wide smiling that they found me
Circling around me
Slowly closing in while you sing

Everything is gonna be fine
Everything is gonna be fine, fine, fine

Fingers stretching out from nowhere
Reaching for my throat
They're hungry for my skin, my skin
Teeth wide smiling that they found me
Circling around me
Slowly closing in, and you sing

Tell all the children to lock those doors
I've seen the smoke in the sky before
Gotta be up on my feet when the morning comes
This light we can't ignore
I feel a chill building up inside
Seeing the sweat filling up my eyes
Tell every friend, enemy of flesh and blood
To send out the battle cry

Everything is gonna be fine, fine
Everything is gonna be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine

Tell all the children to lock those doors
I've seen the smoke in the sky before
Gotta be up on my feet when the morning comes
This light we can't ignore
I feel a chill building up inside
Seeing the sweat filling up my eyes
Tell every friend, enemy of flesh and blood
To send out the battle cry

Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
 
Hey, at least in my mind
I'm feelin' like I'm the hero that saves me
There, I hold my head high
Get everything right
Delusional maybe

Yo, this whole last year was a shit show
Just findin' out now what I didn't know
Seems like each time when I get low
I place blame everywhere that it shouldn't go
And that's what's keeping me up
Fallin' apart, man, I keep it a buck
You still act like I'm holding you up
I still feel like I'm totally nuts, so

Tell me what I should have said and I'll pretend to know that
Things come out my mouth that I should probably learn to hold back
Why do I expect to have the patience that I don't have?
Over and over, expecting a different result, yeah

Hey, at least in my mind
I'm feelin' like I'm the hero that saves me
There, I hold my head high
Get everything right
Delusional maybe
If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
Where I'm better than we both know I could be, oh
Still, at least in my mind
I'm feelin' like I'm the hero that saves me

They like, "Hey, Mike
You can't keep kickin' yourself for the things you say like
There's some people that you could never make right"
And really, do I wanna sweat shit? No
I know I don't wanna let this go
Hold it inside, let it take control

Tell me what I should have said and I'll pretend to know that
Things come out my mouth that I should probably learn to hold back
Why do I expect to have the patience that I don't have?
Over and over and over and over and, oh my god

Hey, at least in my mind
I'm feelin' like I'm the hero that saves me
There, I hold my head high
Get everything right
Delusional maybe
If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
Where I'm better than we both know I could be, oh
Still, at least in my mind
I'm feelin' like I'm the hero that saves me

I keep tellin' myself to stop caring
‘Cause they live for keepin' me staring
And they'll drag it on to make me respond
To get more retweets and more sharing
I don't need the manager, no Karen
‘Cause what's wrong seems so apparent
‘Cause I'm too alive, with bad fuckin' vibes
And I'm so damn sick of bein' stuck inside, 'side, 'side, 'side, yeah

Hey, at least in my mind
I'm feelin' like I'm (Like I'm) the hero that saves me (Ah)
There, I hold my head high (Yeah)
Get everything right (Right)
Delusional maybe (Maybe)
If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
Where I'm better than we both know I could be, oh (Know I could be, know I could be)
Still, at least in my mind (In my mind, yeah)
I'm feelin' like I'm (Like I'm) the hero that saves me (Yeah, ah)

If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
I-If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
I-If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
I-If I'm pretending, why not write happy endings
