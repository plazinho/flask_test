Take out the papers and the trash
Or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor
You ain't gonna rock and roll no more
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's hip; he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside
You ain't got time to take a ride
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Down in Mexicali
There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce
And the boss is a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said "Tell me, man, when does the fun begin?"
He just winked his eye and said, "Man, be cool"

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

In Mexico
All of a sudden in walks a chick
In Mexico
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick
In Mexico
Around her waist she wore three fishnets
In Mexico
She started dancin' with the castanets
In Mexico
I didn't know just what to expect
In Mexico
She threw her arms around my neck
In Mexico
We started dancin' all around the floor
In Mexico
And then she did a dance I never saw before
So if you're south of the border
I mean down in the Mexico
And you wanna get straight, man, don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Hey, como est usted senorita
Come with me to Mexico City
You can get your kicks in Mexico
Hahaha, crazy. Come with me, baby. Come with me
Ah we can watch the bull fights together
Come with me, senorita. yeah... yeah...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
A pretty woman makes her husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he marries her, then she starts
To do the things that will break his heart
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks her meals on time
She'll always give you peace of mind
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Don't let your friends say
You have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly
Her eyes don't match
Take it from me she's a better catch
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Say man
Hey baby
I saw your wife the other day
Yeah?
Yeah, she's ugly
Man, she's ugly but she sure can cook, baby
Yeah? Alright...
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She comes on like a rose but everybody knows
She'll get you in Dutch
You can look but you better not touch

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin', around

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin', around

Measles make you bumpy
And mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll fool ya
And whooping cough can cool ya
But poison ivy, Lord'll make you itch
You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes a-creepin' around

Measles make you bumpy

(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)
(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)

One day while I was eatin' beans (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
Just sittin', diggin' all the scenes (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
A chick came walkin' through the door, that I had never seen before
At least I never saw her down (At Smokey Joe's Cafe) whoa
And I started shakin' when she sat right down next to me, whoa

Her knees were almost touchin' mine (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
A chill was runnin' down my spine (At Smokey Joe's Cafe) ooh-ooh
I could smell her sweet perfume, she smiled at me, my heart went boom
And everybody in the room at Smokey Joe's Cafe
They said, "Man, be careful! That chick belongs to Smokey Joe"

From behind the counter I saw a man
A chef hat on his head and a knife in his hand
He grabbed me by my collar and began to shout
"You'd better eat up all your beans and, boy, then clear right on out!"

Yes, I know I'll never eat again (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
And so we'll never meet again (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
I'd rather eat my chili beans at Jim's or Jack's or John's or Gene's
Than take my chances eatin' down (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
Whoa, I risk my life with that Smokey Joe, the crazy fool

Three cool cats, three cool cats
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car
Dividing up a nickel candy bar
Talking all about how sharp they are, these
Three cool cats
Three cool chicks, three cool chicks
Walkin' down the street swingin' their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
And three cool cats did three big flips for
Three cool chicks
Up popped the first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"I want this middle chick!"
"I want that little chick!"
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"
Three cool chicks, three cool chicks
They look like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
And three cool chicks made three fools of these
Three cool cats
Three cool cats, three cool cats, three cool cats
Three cool catsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Spoken intro)
Who's that I see walkin' in the woods? Why, it's Little Red Riding Hood!
(Song)
Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are looking good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Listen to me
Little Red Riding Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walking in these spooky old woods alone
Ooooowww!
What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought to walk with you for a ways
What full lips you have
They're sure to lure someone bad
So until you get to grandma's place
I think you ought to walk with me and be safe
I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walking with you alone
Ooooowww!
Little Red Riding Hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf so I won't
Ooooowww!
What a big heart I have
The better to love you with
Little Red Riding Hood
Even bad wolves can be good
I'll try to be satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to grandma's place
Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are looking good
You're everything that a big bad wolf could want
Ooooowww!
(Spoken outro)
I mean baa! Baa? Baa!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I went and bought myself a ticket and
I sat down in the very first row, wo wo
They pulled the curtain but then when
They turned the spotlight way down low, wo wo
Little Egypt came out strotting
Wearing nothing but a button and a bow, wo wo
Singing, Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!
She had a ruby on her tummy and
A diamond big as Texas on her toe, wo wo
She let her hair down and
She did the hoochie koochie real slow, wo wo
When she did her special number on a zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show, wo wo
Singing, Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!
She did a triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Saying Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty-nine
Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore, wo wo
She's too busy mopping and
A taking care of shopping at the store, wo wo
'Cause we got seven kids and
All day long they crawl around the floor, wo wo
Singing, Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
