Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know
 
Ooh, yeah

I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial


The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead

Fake anti-fascist lie (Psychosocial)
I tried to tell you, but (Psychosocial)
Your purple hearts are giving out! (Psychosocial)
Can't stop a killing idea (Psychosocial)
If it's hunting season (Psychosocial)
Is this what you want? (Psychosocial)
I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
 
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
 
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
 
Undo these chains, my friend, I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament, swallow but nothing's forgiven
You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted
Make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light, you're not what you seem

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil
I'm not your Devil anymore

Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, deprivation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

So step inside
Step inside
See the devil in I
See the devil in I
 
Pain
(Here comes the pain!)

Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way, it better be
Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
What the hell am I saying? I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent, I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls, let me fall, fuck you all
Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
Fuck it!

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leaving me suspect, I'm leaving you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect you jealous ass, press your face against the glass, suffer

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
Go

I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you

Sick, sick, sick, sick
Yeah
 
Watch this

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time to see
If you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace
Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

I know, and even if I didn't, I would lie so
Many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie and a fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me

(Why) Why was it easy for you?
(Did) Did I deserve the abuse?
(I) I can't believe I let it
(Not) Not what I wanted
(See) See through your bullshit
(Your) You're so traumatic
(True) True to your form of

(Un-) Unintimidated
(-'til) 'Til the very end
(It) It'll never happen
(Was) Was it all a lie?
(Too) Many motherfuckers
(Late) That's what you do best
(Lie) That's what you do best

That's what you do best, that's what you do best
 
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this?
But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just
Making my mind up and taking your breath away

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye!

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

And it waits for you
 
Yeah
Yeah
Come on!
Here we go again, motherfucker
Yeah

Come on down and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand I can't feel anything
It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound like I got a fucking gun against my head
You live when I'm dead

One more time, motherfucker

Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands
And I don't know why I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it?
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I wanna leave without a trace
'Cause I don't wanna die in this place

People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit

People equal shit, what you gonna do?
People equal shit, 'cause I'm not afraid of you
People equal shit, I'm everything you'll never be
People equal shit, yeah!

Come on!
It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion, I'm sitting at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be, ya
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitching and fight your way through it
I'm not like you, I just fuck up
Come on, motherfucker, everybody has to die
Come on, motherfucker, everybody has to die

People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit, yeah
People equal shit, yeah
People equal shit, yeah
People equal shit, yeah

People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit, what you gonna do?
People equal shit, 'cause I'm not afraid of you
People equal shit, I'm everything you'll never be
People equal shit

Got that, right?
 
Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don’t need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

Here’s an unexplainable one
Here’s an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I’m alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don’t need you to hide it from me
I just wanna feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away, here's an unexplainable one

What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years
