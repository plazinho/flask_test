Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch

Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it

You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

If I say that shit then I mean it
She calls me, I screen it, I'm only fuckin' if it's convenient
You lie on pussy, that's weak shit
We pass pussy 'round, that's G shit
But you ain't fam so what is this "we" shit?
You cuff yours and then leash it
Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like "Who the fuck is this dude?"
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head
"I just wanna stay broke forever,"
Yeah that's that shit no one ever said
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've got a lane and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up
That conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
G’s dope, he might blow up, think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it

'Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls
With skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty faces, love status, she acts as if she's the baddest
Man, I swear she's just like tons of girls
She expects the free drinks
And I'm successful, she thinks
Always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on, off and on
Only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days 'cause I'm often gone
When I'm home off tour, never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on
Elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong
But after we fuck it's over, walked out the door;
That's closure
No, I can't stay here and hold her
Tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober, can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong, I gotta go, that's what I told her, yeah

She said she can't feel her face
(She said she can't feel her face)
Yeah, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings, there's no place
But you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
She's fine as fuck and she knows it
Sexy body, she shows it
Loves the drama, she chose it
She draws the line then she blows it
The most fun, I suppose it
Pops a bottle, won't close it
Feels a fit then she throws it
She pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old
Superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish
Want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it, it's you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it
I touched her then she melted
We shouldn't chill but we do it still, gotta play the hand if you dealt it, yeah

She said she can't feel her face
(She said she can't feel her face)
Right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place
But you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Missing everything you say
It's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one
I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day
You're not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight
Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me217EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be
Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedys 
No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies 
Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
Life is too short, trying to hold it all together
It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter 
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better 
It's whatever, I just hope that you remember
Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as Big sweater
She said, "You're always gone." 
I said, "'The fuck do you expect from me?" 
Then she look at me and she said to me
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight
Uh, maybe in some other lifetime
Or somewhere down the road
We might meet up at the right time
Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes 
Clocked me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime 
Well, maybe G is just an asshole
Fuck around with bitches Alfalfa, little rascal
I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
But temptation's always pushing people to the brink 
Fuck, I always lose my judgment when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out 
I try to talk it out but this was all she speak about, she said...

I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me 
Let's let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see 
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime 
Everything will be alright
So baby get some sleep tonight 110EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Even if I don't stay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)
Contemplatin' just who I coulda turned out to be
If I'da stayed and weren’t heard, what would amount to me?
If I had looked and ain’t found what I have found in me
I mean inside, would they love me? Never looked down on me?
They say, "You know, if you loved her well then you would have stayed
You could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn't trade"
Trade for nothing, I did though, I had to chase it
Face it, I wasn’t born to live a life basic
They say, "You turned your back on us just to go and be
An artist, what's a promise anyway when someone breaks it?
I bet he finally gets a shot and then he wastes it
I bet he don’t come back for us when he makes it
And if he do it'd be too late, you gotta face it
'Cause by then there's someone new you been replaced with
Old friends I grew up with, the girl I fell in love with
Love or hate me depending on how you judge it
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)
I had to wander, I had to go tread my own path
If you don't step through no mud, well then it won't last
The years pass, it's crazy how they go fast
Ask myself questions you have, but that you won't ask
Like, "You don’t even come home enough
Where were you when she was in the hospital, huh? It was only us"
And that’s deep and yeah, I know it cuts
But if that gets you, then you’re weak 'cause we were here and it ain’t broken us
Still as close and stayed by her side when no one was
Like when she lost her job and everything, how broke we was
When she was sick and she needed some taking care of
A fifteen year old shouldered the weight and what he was scared of
The worst, I know that you stayed strong
I don’t say this enough, but you made me just as proud as you made Mom
Yeah, you got some anger, but I don’t blame you at all
I know I don't call, but you're my brother
I love ya
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
(It’ll be, it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)
Yeah, in that first grade class they came and got me
"Your mom's outside, say goodbye now to everybody"
U-Haul was waiting with all of her things, at least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way too young to comprehend what was happenin'
"Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?"
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school, I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused, they try explain, but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Over the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important, I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depression's a rotten curse
Hidin' in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becomin' more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her, she was blue, her skin was cold and she wasn't breathin'
Screamed, "Melissa wake up," couldn't fathom that she was leavin'
Mom and Bro was runnin' down, I screamed "Somebody help"
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection
While in her life you made her happy, thank you for the blessin'
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
(It’ll be, it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)95EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
My love is, working hard yadadamean?
My love is, working hard yadadamean?

I've been sitting on the charts like a beach chair
My last album spent 52 weeks there
Almost finished with the second, you should be scared
Storms coming you should go inside and prepare
No shortcuts there ain't no cheats there
I brought the whole city out like a street fair, yeah
And fuck it I'm the coldest white rapper in the game
Since the one with the bleached hair
Yeah, you love it when I talk shit
I get around, yeah I'm on my 2Pac shit
I kinda feel there's no girl I could not get
I'm not found at the function if it's not lit
Yeah, it's nothing that no one can tell me
I made it here dolo, nobody to help me
From the Bay, the birthplace of the hyphy
So bitch, come and say to my face you don't like me

My love is, working hard yadadamean?
My love is, working hard yadadamean?
My love is, working hard yadadamean?
My love is, working hard yadadamean?
It's like I'm always found where the troubles at
Drinking brown shit now I'm off cup of that
Your girl's on me, what's up with that?
If I like her, all this shit will really take is a double tap
Having visions of fucking an A-list singer, Kardashian, or a Jenner
But Ye's got Kim, Tyga swooped up Kylie
So there's one left watch me go get her
Yeah, they tell me calm down
Fuck that I'm too lit can't calm down
I'm so drunk right now I might fall down
And I don't give a fuck how boring do y'all sound
Up and down on a Wednesday
Then we do the same shit the next day
The next star out the Bay is Eazy
Yadadamean? For sho'
Yadadamean? For sheezy

My love is, working hard yadadamean?
My love is, working hard yadadamean?
My love is, working hard yadadamean?

Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(Over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost

What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out "fuck that!"
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let’s do it all - have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything then you have bliss
Then she told me this
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight
Soon I'll be leaving  (I'll be leaving)
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(Over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs, take 10 shots tonight
Awesome I’m naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace I don't mean Danny Granger
Can’t wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
"Let's do this right now" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text...
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost

That's that endless summer, never going back to school
We do what we wanna, can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town, going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving152EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Young Gerald, uh

This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son
Yeah, this shit is not random

Woah, okay
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you (remind you)
'Cause I got what they got, I'm talkin' times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seein' right through
You're hollow, you follow?
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
California out to Georgia, Florida, then up to Illinois
When I listen to your music, I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand 'em
Bred Jordan ones from 2001 (OG)
Today I think I want a Phantom
If I don't get it I'ma throw a fuckin' tantrum, whoa!
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random (nope)
Everybody ain't got it, understand son (sorry)
Yeah, this shit is not random

Now imagine it, put the hours in and stayed passionate
Wasn't blowin' money, I was stackin' it
Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happenin' by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now, nothing less is adequate
Grab a check, cashin' it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference now I finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for, nothin'?
You must be mistakin' someone
I had to go make that fundin'
I'm tryna be great at somethin'
Spend, not saving nothin'
Flyin' from the Bay to London
They say money talks but you ain't saying nothin', shh
Now try and shade me, I'm like, "I guess"
Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
Sign CDs and I sign breasts
Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex
Listen
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls, that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
I got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son
Yeah, this shit is not random54EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Got this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wonderin', I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A., barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn, she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, ooh, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you (ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, "Who is this?"
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am, ooh
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
And now I'm missing your love, ooh38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl
Too many images running through my mind
Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system
Even my brother he asked me what you on
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

Ever since I met you, you got me changing my schedule
If you ain't know, that shit's eventful
And losing this money is dreadful, but
Believe me, that pussy is special
You wanna meet moms, I might let you
Rollie is so presidential
Keep it on while we fuck that's 'cause I meant to, yeah
Fuck you twice, we take a nap, soon as you're awake, get back
Go for three it takes a nack
I'm taking you to places that
You ain't been girl, face the fact, meant it, I can't take it back
Whisky straight, ain't chasing that, I'll taste the cat, yeah
(taste the cat)
Yeah, you told me I own that pearl
Yeah, that's 'cause I bone you thorough
You should be my only girl
When I hit it, you feel like you own the world
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

Since the last time we had sex
Honestly, I've been a mess, well
Feenin' 'cause you got the best
Borderline kind of obsessed and yeah
I'm on some kind of drug
I've been addicted and I cannot find enough
I call you, I'm tryna fuck, I'm in room 921, come on up
And we could put up the "please do not disturb"
I got drink, I got the herb, I'm tweakin', now I must be cured
The only way I rest assured is if
I get my fix
I love the way your dress just slips
Right off your waist, right down your hips
Technique's the best, she knows some tricks and yeah
I need you now, I need you bad
You and me both of us been feenin' bad
I guess what I really mean is that—well, yeah
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain, don't keep me waitin' all night
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room
Girl come through, them bath water runnin'
Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

Ever seen a devil with a halo?
Ever seen an angel with some horns?
Everybody got their own demons
Everybody fightin' their own war, oh

When you move this fast as I'm movin'
All the toxic things that I'm using
All the substances I'm abusin'
All the sex, and the drugs, and the boozin'
The decision is mine for the choosin'
But I can't understand what I'm losin'
'Cause I been this way, it's not a new thing
I know a Gemini can be confusing
Split right down the middle like there's two of me
No hiding, I bare all nudity
This is everything that comes with celebrity
Criticism, ridicule and the scrutiny
Think about what I spent on some jewelry
But it all comes back to me usually
And it's none of y'alls business truthfully
You don't know 'bout the fame, what it do to me
I'm talking to myself like every night
You could try to be a better guy
But to understand a Gemini
Angel, Devil, it's both him and I
Demons in me, they just multiply
If I don't kill 'em all, I never try
Life is short, and men lie, women lie
But a legend, he could never die
Ever seen a devil with a halo? (y'know, uh)
Ever seen an angel with some horns? (y'know)
Everybody got their own demons
Everybody fightin' their own war (uh)
I can be an angel sometimes, I can be real fucked up
I miss you only sometimes, I give you real tough love
'Cause I'm a devil with a halo
Woah, oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh

Put the hours in, put the work in
Swear I try so hard to be perfect
But sometimes, shit feels like a burden
'Cause I still ain't shit but a person
Switch lanes in the Porsche that I'm swervin'
Tell myself slow down off the bourbon
"When you drive like that, it made me nervous"
Not tonight, not closing the curtains
When I die, not trying to see hell
Feel like I'm headed that way in a V12
And I just broke up with my female
On tour, had to do it by email
But that's all, I'ma save you the detail
Therapy with a beat and a freestyle
Either way, live today, I'ma be well
'Cause I never wanna let 'em see me fail
I'm talkin' to myself, "What's wrong with you?
You should make some songs to turn up to
Thinkin' too much like you usually do
'Til you drink some liquor, then you're cool
Throw your brain away, that's all it takes
Dumb it down, but that's not what he makes
Then say fuck the sales and fuck the biz'
It's not that easy Gerald, nothing is"
Ever seen a devil with a halo (yeah)
Ever seen an angel with some horns (y'know)
Everybody got their own demons
Everybody fightin' their own war (uh)
I can be an angel sometimes, I can be real fucked up
I miss you only sometimes, I give you real tough love
'Cause I'm a devil with a halo
Woah, oh-oh
Oh-oh59EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
