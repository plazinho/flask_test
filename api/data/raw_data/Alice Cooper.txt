Your cruel device, your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot, your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet, black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison


One look (one look) could kill (could kill)
My pain, your thrill

I want to love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison (poison)
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

Yeah!
Well, I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison) no
Running deep inside my veins
Burning deep (poison) inside my brain
Poison (poison)
I don't want (poison) to break these chains
Poison (poison)
 
Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya, that's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Yeah!

Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think
Of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely
 
I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm feelin' real shot down
And I'm, I'm gettin' mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes (Nice guy)
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith
He, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene
 
Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen, and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I gotta get out of this place, I'll go runnin in outer space, oh yeah

I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm eighteen
I get confused everyday
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away

Lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes I like it, oh I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, Eighteen!
Eighteen, eighteen and I like it
 
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore ya
Man or woman living
Couldnâ€™t love you like me baby

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Aww!

Yeah, billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter
Any tighter than me maybe
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog
That's been infected by the rabies

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

Million dollar baby
Yeah, billion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby, baby
 
Mommy, where's daddy?
He's been gone for so long
Do you think he'll ever come home?

I was gone for fourteen days
I might been gone for more
Held up in the intensive care ward
Lyin' on the floor
I was gone for all those days
But I, was not all alone
I made friends with a lot of people
In the danger zone

See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Since I've gone away

I think I lost some weight there
And I, I'm sure I need some rest
Sleepin' don't come very easy
In a straight white vest
Sure'd like to see that little children
She's only four years old... old
I'd give her back all of her playthings
Even, even the ones I stole

See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone insane

I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here
I, I gotta get out of here
I, I gotta get out of here
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere
Ya gotta let me out of here
Let me outta here
(Incoherent rambling shouts continue and fade as next verse starts)

See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Blown up in my face


I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I, I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to myself this is very strange
I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin'
And so I am not free
I didn't want to be
I didn't want to be
I didn't want to be

See my lonely life unfold
(I didn't want to be)
I see it every day
(Leave me alone
I didn't want to be
Don't touch me!)
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone Insane
 
Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for's
An even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
Slaps you once in a while
And you live in love and pain
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Black eyes all of the time
"Don't spend a dime"
"Clean up this grime"
And you there down on your knees
Begging me please
Come watch me bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
 
I don't want to see you go
I don't even want to be there
I will cover up my eyes
And pray it goes away
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
I don't like to hear you cry
You just don't know how deep that cuts me
So I will cover up my eyes
And it will go away
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
STEVEN!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
That icy breath that whispers screams of pain!
I don't want to feel you die
But if that's the way that God has planned you
I'll put pennies on your eyes
And it will go away
See?
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
Steven.... Is someone calling me? No....
Steven....
I think I hear a voice--- it's outside the door!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
STEVEN!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
STEVEN!
STEVEN!
STEVEN!
I hear my name....
 
Yes, yes, I know you're hungry
And here comes dinner
(Feed my Frankenstein)

Well, I ain't evil
I'm just good lookin'
Start a little fire
Baby, start cookin'
I'm a hungry man
But I don't want pizza
I'll blow down your house
And then I'm gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers
Up your greasy spine

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time

You don't want to talk
So baby, shut up
And let me drink the wine
From your fur tea cup
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Make my tattoos
Melt in the heat
Well, I ain't no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin' on your
Ice cream cone

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time

Baby whoa whoa, oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstein
Whoa whoa, baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstein
He's a psycho
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's lunch time
 
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly
For making us doubt our parent's authority
For choosing to be a living obscenity
You can go to Hell
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane
You'd gift wrap a leper
And mail him to your Aunt Jane
You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane
You can go to Hell
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell
 
Welcome to my nightmare
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel you belong
A nocturnal vacation
Unnecessary sedation
You want to feel at home cause you belong
Welcome to my nightmare, whoa-whoa-oh
Welcome to my breakdown
I hope I didn't scare you
That's just the way we are when we come down
We sweat and laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here
Welcome to my breakdown, whoa-whoa-oh
You're welcome to my nightmare, yeah-yeah-ah
Welcome to my nightmare
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel you belong
We sweat and laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here
Welcome to my nightmare, ooh-ooh-ooh
Welcome to my breakdown
Yeah
 
I love the dead before they're cold
The bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see
Nothing

I love the dead before they rise
No farewells, no goodbyes
I never even knew your now rotting face
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave
I have other uses for you, darling

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dead-dead-dead-dead-dead-dead
Dead-dead-dead-dead-dead-dead

I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead, so


I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I love the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
I, I love the dead

I love the dead before they're cold
Their bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see
Nothing
 
Hey bro, take it slow
You ain't livin' in a video
You're flying low with a high velocity
No doubt, you're stressin' out
That ain't what rock n' roll's about
Get off that one way trip down lonely street
Now I know you've been kicked around
You ain't alone in this ugly town
You stick a needle in your arm
You bite the dust, you buy the farm

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

C'mon girl, it's a better day
Get your foot out of that grave
Don't let that one love tear your world apart
C'mon babe, kick that stuff
Show the street it ain't so tough
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart
Now I know you've been seeing red
Don't put a pistol to your head
Sometimes your answer's heaven sent
Your way is so damn permanent

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

This ain't your daddy talkin'
You know, I know
Your story ain't so shocking
You know, I know
Blow some steam
C'mon and scream

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
 
Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin
She got them from the shelf up on the wall
Betty's mommy wasn't there to save her
She didn't even hear her baby call

Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well, we didn't want you anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la

Daddy is an agrophile in Texas
Mommy's on the bar most every night
Little Betty's sleeping in the graveyard
Living there in burgundy and white

Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well, we didn't love you anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la

Goodbye, Little Betty
Goodbye, Little Betty
So long, Little Betty
So long, Little Betty
Betty, so long


Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well, we didn't need you anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la

Goodbye, Little Betty
