Bring your own lampshade, somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, never learn how to swim, now

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then, I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line
At the swingin' party, down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want
Then, I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line
Everything in time
At the swingin' party, down the line
Catch the time
At the swingin' party, down the line3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain
Same hair, revolution
Same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

Don't get him wrong and don't get him mad
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
And she don't need advice that'll center her
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

Mirror image, see no damage
See no evil at all
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at
The way you're laughed at now
Now, something meets Boy, and something meets Girl
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
Same hair, revolution
Unisex, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
And tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today, the people dress the way that they please
The way they tried to do in the last centuries

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

If he was from Venus, would he feed us with a spoon?
If he was from Mars, then that'd be cool
Standing right on campus, would he stamp us in a file?
Hangin' down in Memphis all the while

And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
Yeah, I'm in love with that song"

Cerebral rape and pillage in a village of his choice
Invisible man who can sing in a visible voice
Feeling like a hundred bucks, exchanging good lucks face to face
Check-checkin' his stash by the trash at St. Mark's Place

And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round, 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
Well, I'm in love with that song"

I never travel far
Without a little Big Star, ooh-ooh

Runnin' 'round the house, Mickey Louse and tarot cards
Falling asleep with a flop pop video on
And if he was from Venus, would he meet us on the moon?
If he died in Memphis, then that'd be cool, babe

And children by the million wait for Alex Chilton to come around, 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
I'm in love with that song
I'm in love, what's that song?
Yeah, I'm in love with that song"

Oh! Come on!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ohhh!

God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung
Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
The daughters and the sons

Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom
Elvis in the ground, no way he'll be here tonight
Income tax deduction, one hell of a function
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Now the daughters and the sons

Unwillingness to claim us
Ya got no warrant to name us
The ones who love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest
And visit their graves on holidays at best
The ones who love us least are the ones we'll die to please
If it's any consolation, I don't begin to understand them

Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Daughters and the sons

Young
Of young
Young

Take it, it's yours, take it, it's yours, take it, it's yours

I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again

Lights that flash in the evening
Through a crack in the drapes

Jesus rides beside me
He never buys any smokes
Hurry up, hurry up, ain't you had enough of this stuff?
Ashtray floors, dirty clothes, and filthy jokes
See you're high and lonesome
Try, try and try

Lights that flash in the evening
Through a hole in the drapes
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
I can't hardly wait

I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst
After a hard day of nothin' much at all
The summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
To take my place in back with the loudmouths
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house

And everybody wants to be special here
They call your name out, loud and clear

Here comes a regular
Call out your name
Here comes a regular
Am I the only one here today?

Well, a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town
And once the police made you go away
And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby, now
I'll take a great big whiskey to you anyway
And everybody wants to be someone's here
Someone's gonna show up, never fear

'Cause here comes a regular
Call out your name
Yes, now here comes a regular
Am I the only one who feels ashamed?

Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes
He says, "Opportunity knocks once, then the door slams shut."
All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy
The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts
First the lights, then the collar goes up and the wind begins to blow
Turn your back on a pay-you-back, last call
First the glass, then the leaves that last, then comes the snow
Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Was you satisfied?
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Hey, are you satisfied?

And it goes so slowly on
Everything I've ever wanted
Tell me what's wrong?

Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfied
Were you satisfied?
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Now, are you satisfied?

Everything goes, well, anything goes
All of the time
Everything you dream of is right in front of you
And everything is a lie

Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfed
Look me in the eye, unsatisfied
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so dissatisfied
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so unsatisfied
Well, uh-- well, I'm-a
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so dissatis-, dissatis-, dissastis...
I'm so...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Read about your band
In some local page
Didn't mention your name
Didn't mention your name
Sweet Georgia breezes
Safe, cool and warm
I headed up north
You headed north

On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?

Weary voice that's laughin'
On the radio once
We sounded drunk
But you never made it on
Passin' through and it's late
The station started to fade
Picked another one up
In the very next state
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on and...

Pretty girl keep growin' up
Playin' make-up, wearin' guitar
Growin' old in a bar
Ya grow old in a bar
Headed out to San Francisco
Definitely not L.A
Didn't mention your name
Didn't mention your name

And if I don't see ya in
A long, long while
I'll try to find you

How young are you? How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eye
How smart are you? How dumb am I?
Don't count any of my advice

Oh, meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I might dare

Call me on Thursday, if you will
Or call me on Wednesday, better still
Ain't lost yet, so I gotta be the winner
Fingernails and cigarettes, a lousy dinner
How young are you?
Oh, oh, oh
Come on!

Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
How young are you? How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eyes
How smart are you? How smart are you!?
How dumb am I?
(How dumb am I?)

Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare
Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I will dare1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Drive yourself right up the wall
No one hears and no one calls
It's a boring state
It's a useless wait, I know
Brag about things you don't understand
A girl and a woman, a boy and a man
Everything's sexually vague
Now you're wondering to yourself if you might be gay

Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
One day, baby, maybe help you through

Drive your ma to the bank
Tell your pa you got a date
But you're lying
Now you're lying on your back
Trying to figure out, they wonder what next you'll pull
You don't understand anything sexual
I don't understand
Tell my friends I'm doing fine
And your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny, you ain't laughing, are you?
Sixteen blue
Sixteen
Sixteen

Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny, you ain't laughing, are you?
Sixteen blue
