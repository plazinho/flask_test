Say, say, my playmate
Won't you lay hands on me?
Mirror my malady?
Transfer my tragedy?
Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish (My mind's aflame)
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and crave gets slaked

My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it
My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that'll blow your Mongrel mind
Baby doll, I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind
It's you, you, you, you

I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go so let me show you
I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
We've got 'til noon, here comes the moon, so let it show you
Show you now

Dream me, oh, dreamer, down to the floor
Open my hands and let them weave onto yours
Feel me, completer, down to my core
Open my heart and let it bleed onto yours
Feeding on fever, down on all fours
Show you what all the howling is for

Hey, hey, my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot, hot, hot, hot here
Got a curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
There's a curse comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Tell your grandma and your mama too
It's true, true, true, true

We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
 
Congratulations on the mess you made of things
I'm trying to reconstruct the air and all that brings
And oxidation is the compromise you own
But this is beginning to feel like the dog wants her bones, say

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You force your fire and then you falsify your deeds
Your methods dot the disconnect from all your creeds
And fortune strives to fill the vacuum that it feeds
But this is beginning to feel like the dog's lost her lead, say

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

This is beginning to feel
Like the long winded blues of the never
This is beginning to feel
Like it's curling up slowly and finding a throat to choke

This is beginning to feel
Like the long winded blues of the never
Barely controlled locomotive consuming the picture
And blowing the crows to smoke

This is beginning to feel
Like the long winded blues of the never
Static explosion devoted to crushing the broken
And shoving their souls to ghost

Eternalized, objectified
You set your sights so high
But this is beginning to feel
Like the bolt busted loose from the lever

Never mind, death professor
Your structure's fine, my dust is better
Your victim flies so high
All to catch a bird's eye view of who's next

Never you mind, death professor
Love is life, my love is better
Your victim flies so high
Eyes could be the diamonds confused with who's next

Never you mind, death professor
Your shocks are fine, my struts are better
Your fiction flies so high
Y'all could use a doctor who's sick, who's next?

Never you mind, death professor
Electrified, my love is better
It's crystallized, so am I
All could be the diamond fused with who's next

This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
 
My mast ain't so sturdy
My head is at half
I'm searching the clouds for the score
My lady avails herself
Of marked down freedom
Forever cashed out to no more
She put the blam in the blame
Bullets bearing the name
Of each tigress who's left you a tooth
Save the skins for a pelt
And the rest for a belt
That can't open
No nothing
Can't open
No nothing

Young liars
Thank you for taking my hands
Young liars
Oh thank you for taking my hands

Well it's cold and it's quiet
And cobblestone cold in here
Fucking for fear of not wanting
To fear again
Lonely is all we are
Lovely so far
But my heart's still a marble
In an empty jelly jar
Someday suppose that my
Curious nervousness
Spills into prescience
Clairvoyant consciousness
I will be calmer than cream
Making maps out of your dreams
But will psychic ability
Clinch the nativity?
Or simply diminish that flinch?
Oh young liars

Oh young liars
I said thank you for taking my hands
And burying them deep in the world's wet womb
Where no one can heed their commands
Where no one can heed their commands except young liars
Young liars

Voice string trombone
Pull me forward onward
To the sea
Take my picture
Soon all I will be
Is my disease
Voice string trombone
Pull me forward onward
To the sea
Take my picture
Soon all I will be
Is my disease
 
Oui je t'aime, oui je t'aime
À demain, à la prochaine
I know it's best to say goodbye
But I can't seem to move away

Not to say, not to say
That you shouldn't share the blame
There is a softness to your touch
There is a wonder to your ways

Don't know how I feel, what's the deal?
Is it real? When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well, I'm here, won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you, oh, careful you

Don't know, should we stay? Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you, oh, careful you, careful you

Oui je t'aime, oui je t'aime
From the cradle to the grave
You've done a number on my heart
And things will never be the same

Freeze a frame, freeze a frame
From a fever dream of days
We learned the secret of a kiss
And how it melts away all pain

Don't know how I feel, what's the deal?
Is it real? When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well, I'm here, won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you, oh, careful you

Don't know, should we stay? Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you, oh, careful you, careful you

Don't know how I feel, what's the deal?
Is it real? When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well, I'm here, won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you, oh, careful you

Don't know, should we stay? Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you, oh, careful you, careful you
 
Cross the street from your
Storefront cemetery
Hear me hailing from inside
And realize - I'm--
I am the conscience clear
In pain or ecstasy
We are all weaned, my dear
Upon the same fatigue
You're staring at the sun
(Oh, my own voice cannot save me now)
Standing in the sea
(One more breath and then I'll go down)
Your mouth is open wide, the lover is inside
And all the tumult's done, collided with the sun
You're staring at the sun, you're standing in the sea
Your body's over me
Note the trees because the
Dirt is temporary
More to mine than fact, face
Name, and monetary
Beat the skins and let the
Loose lips kiss you clean
Quietly pour out like light
Like light, like answering (the sun)
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide (the sun)
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck (the sun)
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me (the sun)
You're staring at the sun (Be what you will)
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide (And then throw down your life)
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck (Oh, it's a damned fine game)
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me (And we can play all night)
You're staring at the sun, you're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide, you're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck, there's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
 
It might be impractical
To seek out a new romance
We won't know the actual
If we never take the chance
I'd love to collapse with you
And ease you against this song
I think we're compatible
I see that you think I'm wrong

But anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you?

Your love makes a fool of you
You can't seem to understand
A heart doesn't play by rules
And love has its own demands
But I'll be there to take care of you
If ever you should decide
But you don't want to waste your life
In the middle of a lovesick lullaby

But anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you?

Oh my reddest rose, caldera, set it off
How your fire grows hermosa caldera glistening
Through your fussed blows careen your caldera set it off
As your body flows the second hand flashes passes
Over your skin like time

Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you
 
Stuck in the shade where there’s no sunshine
I don’t wanna play with them other kids in the sun

Since you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
Yeah, you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, yeah
Ignorance is bliss
I’m a happy idiot
Waving at cars
I’m gonna bang my head to the wall
‘Til I feel like nothing at all
I’m a happy idiot
To keep my mind off you

Stuck in a daze and I’ve lost my mind
I don’t wanna stay where the blame’s all mine

Since you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
Yeah, you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down

So, I shut it off
So, I shut it all off
So, I shut it off
So, I shut it all off
It’s been a long way down
It’s been a long way down

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, yeah
Ignorance is bliss
I’m a happy idiot
Waving at cars
I’m gonna bang my head to the wall
‘Til I feel like nothing at all
I’m a happy idiot
To keep my mind off you

To keep my mind off you
To keep my mind off you
 
Oh, here comes trouble
Put your helmet on, we'll be headed for a fall
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow
And the devil's got my number
S'long overdue, he'll come looking soon
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow

Oh, here comes trouble
These people talk too much, need to shut 'em up
Yeah, I'd rather be alone
Can you, can you feel that rumble?
All this borrowed time, it's been running out
It's the ending of the show

But I know now, yeah
Yeah, I know now, yeah

"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!"

Oh, I've changed my number
Wore disguises and went undercover just to
Just to hide away from you
All my ghosts came a' calling
Making noises 'bout a promise I had broken
Oh, I'm gonna be lonely soon

Oh, here comes trouble
Put your helmet on, we'll be headed for a fall
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow
And the devil's got my number
S'long overdue, he'll come looking soon
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow

"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!"

"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
 
Under my love
Wake up to your window
The day calls in billows
It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart
In cozy red rainbow
It's shaking off halos
And the memory of our sacred so and so
Oh, take my hand sweet
Complete your release, unbury your feet
And married we'll be
Alone in receiving ours is a feeling not that they would see
They don't know that we could be
Down where your cradle escaped the sea
And your raven haired mama caught told you so's

We're hanging in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

Ah me all mine
Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently
Call me on time
And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully
All into line
There's a garden grave and a place there saved for me
I fall by your side
Though your silver haired mama throws told you so's

We're hanging in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

And now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree
In halted harmony
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us young
 
How much do I love you?
How hard must we try
To set into motion
A love divine?
I should really give it up sometime
Should've known by the way things started
That I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometime
No reprieve for the broken hearted
Yeah, I should really give it up sometime
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
Hey, there it goes
Into sun, stream and marigolds
I am yours, you are mine
Through a lifetime of disagreements
Take me high, take me low
Take me nowhere my poor heart can't follow
Reckless hearts soon collide
Break through a lifetime of stress and evil
I should really give it up sometime
Should've known it couldn't last forever
But I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometimes
All I wanted was to love you better
But I should really give it up sometime
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
Oh, come and get lost, love
Why wrestle the tide?
All set into motion
Our love divine
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
How much do I love you?
How hard must we try?
How deep is the ocean?
 
Hope it isn't broken, tried to keep it open
But I couldn't hold it, smashed it down for all to see
And I tried to get repairs done, I couldn't fix it
So, I picked it up and smashed it down for all to see

But I remember when we were so cool
And you were the only one
And now I know that I was such a fool
Thinking you're the only one

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way
And be the first test pilot

Now we're stumbling through the motions, criminal and careless
Thought you were my best friend, now I couldn't care less, can't you see?
And you're playing my emotions, way out of proportion
Damage and distortion, blasting through your fantasy

Oh, but I was such a fool
Thinking you're the only one
It didn't have to be so cruel
Thinking you're the only one

I know that we get down
But we can't touch the ground
Look up, fall into sky
Gone at the speed of sound
One circle back around
Straight on, test pilot, fly

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way
And be the first test pilot
 
I was a lover before this war
Held up in a luxury suite, behind a well-barricaded door
Now that I've cleaned up, gone legit
I can see clearly, round hole
Round hole, square peg don't fit
I'm locked in my bedroom, so send back the clowns
My clone wears a brown shirt
And I seduce him when there's no one around
Mano y mano on a bed of nails
Bring it on like a storm
'Til I knock the wind out of his sails
And we don't make eye contact when we have run-ins in town
Just a barely polite nod
And nervous stares towards the ground
I once joined a priest class, plastic, inert
Slow-danced with commerce
Like a lens up a skirt
And we liked to party
And we kept it live
And we had a three volume tome of contemporary slang
To keep a handle on all this jive
Ennui unbridled, let's talk to kill the time
How many styles did you cycle through before you were mine?
And it's been a while since we went wild and that's all fine
But we're sleepwalking through this trial
And it's really a crime, it's really a crime, it's really a crime
It's really criminal
We're busy tempting like fate's on the nod
Running on empty, bourbon and God
It's been a while though since we knew the way
And it's been even longer
Since our plastic priest class had a goddamned thing
To say
I was a lover before this war
I was a lover before this war
I was a lover before this war
