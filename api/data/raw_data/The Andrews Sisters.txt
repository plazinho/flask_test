Each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign
He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree (Eep! Eloki-pahee-sahana)
That civilization is a thing for me to see

So, bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
That no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed (Magazine? What happens?)
I see how people who are civilized bung you with automobile (You know you can get hurt that way, Daniel?)
At the movies, they have got to pay many coconuts to see (What do they see, Danny?)
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

So, bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, he's so happy in the jungle, he refuse to go
Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis, noise in my ear
So, no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here
They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train (The Tringle-lingle-hoola-humbaloo Express!)
And though it's smokey and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain (Alokoko-hosahima-hana)
When they've got two weeks vacation, they hurry to vacation ground (What do they do, Danny?)
They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round

So, bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no jailhouse, shotgun, fish-hooks, golf clubs, I got my spears
So, no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

They have things like the atom bomb
So I think I'll stay where I am
Civilization, I'll stay right here3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
{Intro}
If you ever go down Trinidad
They make you feel so very glad
Calypso sing and make up rhyme
Guarantee you one real good fine time
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
Oh, beat it man, beat it
Since the Yankee come to Trinidad
They got the young girls all goin' mad
Young girls say they treat 'em nice
Make Trinidad like paradise
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
Oh, you vex me, you vex me
From Chicachicaree to Mona's Isle
Native girls all dance and smile
Help soldier celebrate his leave
Make every day like New Year's Eve
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
It's a fact, man, it's a fact
In old Trinidad, I also fear
The situation is mighty queer
Like the Yankee girl, the native swoon
When she hear der Bingle croon
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
Out on Manzanella Beach
G.I. romance with native peach
All night long, make tropic love
Next day, sit in hot sun and cool off
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
It's a fact, man, it's a fact
Rum and Coca-Cola
Rum and Coca-Cola
Workin' for the Yankee dollar3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now blowing reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the Cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot, he blows it eight to the bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playing with him
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He was the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight to the bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He blows it eight to the bar
He can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with him
The company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes them up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille
He's boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In The Mood
By Andrews Sisters
Mr. Whatchacallim, whatcha doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood, because I'm feelin' just right!
How's about a corner with a table for two?
Where the music's mellow and some gay rendezvous!
There's no chance romancin' with a blue attitude!
You've got to do some dancin' to get in the mood!
Sister Whatchacallim that's a timely idea!
Something swing-a-dilla would be good to my ear!
Everybody must agree that dancin' has charms
When you have that certain one you love in your arms!
Steppin' out with you will be a sweet interlude!
Oh build'er up for that would put me in the mood!
In the mood!
That's it!
I got it!
In the mood!
Your ear will spot it!
In the mood!
Oh what a hot hit!
Be alive
And get the jive
You've got to learn how!
Hep-hep-hep!
Hep like a hepper!
Pep-pep-pep!
Hot as a pepper!
Step-step-step!
Step like a stepper!
From muggin' to huggin'
We're in the mood now!
Mr. Watchacallim, All you needed was fun!
You can see the wonders that this evening has done!
Your feet were so heavy, till they hardly could move!
Now they're light as feathers and you're right in the groove!
You were only hungry for some musical food!
You're positively absolutely in the mood!
Sister watchacallim, I'm indebted to you!
It all goes to show what good a new hit could do!
Never felt so happy and so fully alive!
It seems that jammin' jumpin' is a powerful jive!
Swing-a-roo has given me a new attitude!
My heart is full of rhythm and I'm in the mood!
In the mood!
That's it!
'Cause I got it!
And I'm–
In the mood!
Your ear will spot it!
When you're–
In the mood!
Babababadilibidibababobo
Be alive
And get the jive
You've got to learn how!
Hep-hep-hep!
You're Hep like a hepper!
Full of–
Pep-pep-pep!
You're hot as a pepper!
And you Step-step-step!
Step, step like a stepper!
From muggin'
And now we're huggin'
'Cause we're in the mood!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I wrote my Mother, I wrote my Father
And now I'm writing you too
I'm sure of Mother, I'm sure of Father
And now I want to be sure
Very, very sure
Of you
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me,
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home.
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me,
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
I just got word from a guy who heard
From the guy next door to me
The girl he met just loves to pet
And it fits you to a T
So don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
With anyone else but her, no, no, no
Not a single soul but me, no, no, no
Don't you sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Not till you see me
Not until you see me marching home
Home, home, home, sweet home
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me
With anyone else but her, no, no, no
Not a single soul but me, no, no, no
Don't you go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me
Not till you see me
Not until you see me marching home
Home, home, home, sweet home
Can't wait till I come marching home
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane
No walking down Lovers' Lane
Till you see me
When you see me marching home
Then we'll go arm in arm
We'll sit down under the apple tree
Baby just you and me
When I come marching home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hello railroad, is this the railroad?
I want a one way ticket down to Tennessee
I'm leaving immediately, Chattanooga, here I come
Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
Right on track 29, boy, you can give me a shine
I can afford to board the Chattanooga choo choo
I've, I've, I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina
When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rolling
Whoo, whoo, Chattanooga, there you are
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
In, in satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga choo choo, won't you choo choo me home?
Hey, there, boy, yes, yes, yes
I'm a comin' back to Tennessee
Hey, there, boy, yes, yes, yes
I want a one way ticket on the
Chattanooga choo choo train
Hey, pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo choo choo?
Right on track 29, my baby, I'm fine
Boy, you can give me a shine
Give me a very good shine
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
All dressed up in satin and lace, oh, what a funny face
(I used to call funny face)
I used to call her just a funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga choo choo, won't you choo choo me home!?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, tico tico, tick!
Oh, tico tico, tock!
This tico tico, he's the cuckoo in my clock
And when he says "cuckoo,"
He means it's time to woo
It's tico time for all the lovers on the block
I've got a heavy date
A tete a tete at eight
So speak, oh, tico, tell me if it's getting late?
If I'm on time, cuckoo
But, if I'm late, woo-woo!
The one my heart is gone to may not want to wait!
For just a birdie, and a birdie who goes nowhere
He knows of every lover's lane and how to go there;
For in affairs of the heart
My tico's terribly smart
He tells me: "gently, sentimentally at the start!"
Oh, oh, I hear my little tico tico calling
Because the time is right and shades of night are falling
I love that not-so-cuckoo cuckoo in the clock
Tico tico tico tico tico tock!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
