(Four, tres, two, uno)
Listen up y'all, 'cause this is it
The beat that I'm banging is delicious

Fergalicious definition, make the boys go loco
They want my treasures so they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons

Fergalicious (So delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (Muah!)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got (Four, tres, two, uno)

It's so delicious (It's hot, hot)
It's so delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock)

They always claim they know me

I'm the F to the E-R-G the I, the E
And can't no other lady put it down like me

I'm fergalicious (So delicious)
My body stay vicious
I be up in the gym, just working on my fitness
He's my witness (Ooh, wee!)

Honey, get some patience
Maybe then you'll get a taste
Of my tasty, tasty

It's so tasty, tasty
It'll make you crazy

To the D, to the E to the
To the, to the... (Hit it, Fergie)

All the time I turn around, brothas gather 'round
Always looking at me up and down, looking at my uhhh
I just wanna say it now, I ain't trying to 'round up
Drama little mama, I don't wanna take your man
And I know I'm coming off just a little bit conceited
And I keep on repeatin' how the boys wanna eat it
But I'm tryna tell, that I can't be treated like clientele
'Cause they say she delicious (So delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious

Yeah, Polow Da Don, it's Fergie

If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!
"If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!"

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flying first class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines, shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sipping, reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm...

First class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous

Ooh, the flossy, flossy

The glamorous, glamorous

Ooh, the flossy, flossy
I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous, Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah

I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!)
My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!")
He let his daughter know

Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking

Let it go, get rolled, I just can't hold
Back and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul
Ain't controlling effects, so what the heck
Rock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next
Tease on the camera, freeze while I animate
I'm no amateur, I'ma laminate
I'ma assassinate all the imitates
Then I'ma take a break, and meditate
Hmm, let me think about it
Put my little noodle on the problem, then I drink about it
Drink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little
Feel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy
Beez got me feeling like a gypsy
Smoking on a hookah got me feeling like a hippie, trippy
Gone for a minute and you missed me
Now Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies, what

Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking
This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, this is how I do

Yo, ayo, let it go, let's go
I keep a bar like Esco
I wanna ball, where the nets go?
I'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go
Bitches is my sons, they don’t wanna leave the nest, though
They like, aw, where the ref go?
I-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow
I made a movie like Seth Ro'
And since I came in the game, they careers on death row
Damn, they ain't seen young Nicki in a week
Five shows, made three millie in a week
You are now looking at the the best, the elite
Too bad you can't go and invest them critiques
I’m thick and petite, tell 'em quick, pick a seat
I pull up in the Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat
I know they on E, but I don't give a F, though
Bad attitude, but my pussy is the best, though

Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking
This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, this is how I do

Come get some, you little bums
Dudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb
From the original, sexual, visual dope chick and all that good shit
Charismatic when I'm at it
When I add it up, I'm mathematic, baby
Top game, I'm out the attic
There you have it, no dramatics, hold the static
Pose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing
Baby, I'm glamorous, and I'm folding
Grammys and AMAs, I'm holding
Amazing the way I keep shit frozen
Cool, that's true, got new shoes and a new attitude
Got my hair did, got a new hairdo
Come and see me at a venue near you

I said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it
Just watch and learn, baby, watch and learn, baby
It's hot, it burns so I drop it
Oh baby, watch me when I drop it
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?
Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking

This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, (yeah) this is how I do (yeah)
This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, this is how I do

Make some noise for my girl Fergie Ferg

La, da, da, da

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and UNO cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

To say it's complicated, understatement of the year
Well maybe conflict made it the new flavor in your ear
They know that I'm a problem, that's why everybody scared
Whatever doesn't kill you, can make you an ill-ionaire
Uh, just turn the headphones up or make the windows roll up
I make they hands go up
When I show up and I blow it 'til I'm full up, wait, hold up
Girl up in the mirror, only one I fear, uh
You say you the realest, I told you I'm the illest

Sick, sick, mmm
Hungry, starving
Not thirsty, just hungry
Ambitious, still hungry
Still hungry

I'm moonwalking on marble floors
Rick Ross, I'm just drippin' sauce
Bitches see me and they all just wave
Rolls Royce and we call this Wraith
I fuck up money like I'm Escobar
Ballin', ballin', Kobe Bryant, that boy living large
No room for medium, that means you thinkin' small
Ferrari, Fergie, switching gears, she rockin' with a boss
I close my eyes, I must be telepathic
Look over haters, tripling my assets
It takes courage to accomplish these things
Fergie's my queen, I'm the king, now come kiss on our rings
Sick, sick, mmm

Mmm, da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full (or is it half empty?)
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down, (down), down, (down), down

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
(Haha yeah, who really cares?)

Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness (remember life's beautiful)
Still I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (more)
More (more), more, more, more
Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?

Starting to think it's out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go...

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?, uh
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli, uh
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really? Really really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari
Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
Who cares anyway?

You could go or you could stay
Mmm, mmm
You could go, you could stay

Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?

Enchanted, delighted to meet you, excited
The people, the music, I want you, consume it
Too simple, this greeting, a ritual, a meeting
The first time impressions, your truest expression

If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would

Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?
This feeling, can't lose it, it's better to use it
To find out, discover how we like each other
The mystery, not knowing
Why can't we be showing our secrets, the magic?
Let's reach out and grab it

If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would

Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?

You come and go my way, let's do this every day
Happy is where I be, so take a ride with me
So come and go my way, let's do this every day
Happy is where I be, so take a ride with me
New memories, new faces, subplotted, embrace it
With kisses, "I love you's," below and above you
The details, the levels make me want to revel
Inside your perspective, I swear I'm objective

If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would

Hi, hello, and how are you?
Very well, thank you, and you?
And you? And you?
And you? And you? And you?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Got a lot of answers I'm looking for in these meds
'Bout time I talk to somebody, shrink my head
A lot of promises, broken things that were said
And I can't get out of this bed
Got bruises on my heart, plenty scars on my mind
Got blisters under the band-aid over my life
Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there
Lord knows I'm not perfect

When everything around me starts to fall
I rise up again to the call

We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little

Gotta wait first of the month to pick up that check
He bounced, and left, it was over, never came back
Had a lot of questions 'bout daddy after he left
Now it's just momma and them kids, and she said
"I'll hold her down, don't you worry, we'll find a way
No matter how, I'll make sure the bills get paid"
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed
She prayed the cycle would end
When everything around us starts to fall
We rise up again to the call

We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little

Sometimes when you feel like you need it
They send in the medic, woah
But if it's your soul that is bleeding
That slow drip won't help it, no
It's time to get up to the front of the line
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind
Well, well, well, well
There's nothing that's holding you down
Stuck on the ground, far from the crown
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know

We're all just a little bit broken (Ye-e-ah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Ye-e-ah)
We've all got wounds half open (Ye-e-ah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little (A little, a little )
