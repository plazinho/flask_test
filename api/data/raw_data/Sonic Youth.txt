You're it
No, you're it
Hey, you're really it
You're it
No I mean it, you're it
Say it
Don't spray it
Spirit desire (face me)
Spirit desire (don't displace me)
Spirit desire
We will fall
Miss me
Don't dismiss me
Spirit desire
Spirit desire, spirit desire
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire, spirit desire
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall


Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two

Time to get it
Before you let it get to you
Here he comes now
Stick to your guns and let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes
I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you

Now I see it
I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you
And it's not clear while you make the way

Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

It better work out
I hope it works out my way
Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head
It takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now

You better look it
We're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero
We paint a zero on his hand


We know it's down
We know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is round it
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and cooze

It's time to go round
A one man showdown teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now
And back on the road on the riot trail
 
Kool Thing sitting with a kitty
Now you know you're sure looking pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a little chance here

I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

Kool Thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave

I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

Yeah, tell 'em about it
Hit 'em where it hurts
Hey, Kool Thing, come here
Sit down beside me
There's something I got to ask you
I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is
Huh?
Yeah
Don't be shy
Word up
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby
I just want to know that we can still be friends
Let everybody know
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Kool thing, kool thing
When you're a star, I know that you'll fix everything

Kool thing sitting with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master

I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

Kool thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
What'd he say?

I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
 
I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over, she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in
Her light eyes were dancing, she is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer saying, "I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home."

My future is static
It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me
 
I ripped your heart out from your chest
Replaced it with a grenade blast

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate

The Firefighters hose me down
I don't care, I'll burn out anyhow
It's four-alarm, girl, nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me, huh-huh-huh-yeah


You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate

The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at your feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery, oh


You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover burning mind

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
 
Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me
Hey, what are you waiting for? Feeding, feeding me?
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in the mirror and I'm bigger in every way

She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

I'm in heaven now, I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye Downey, hello Janis
Hello Dennis, Elvis, and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end

Dreaming, dreaming of how it was supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way

She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Hey mom, look I'm up here, I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad, the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said "Honey, you look so under-fed"


Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes and I'm bigger in every way

She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Goodbye Richard, gotta go now
I'm finally on my own, but Dan's got a gig
Keep the love lights glowing, little girl's got the blues
I can still hear mama say
"Honey, don't let it go to your head"
 
Ah...
Ah...

Long ago
And oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really there
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do


Loneliness
Is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again
What to say
To make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
 
10, 20, 30, 40
Tell me that you wanna hold me
Tell me that you wanna bore me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to slowly
Tell me that you're burning for me
Tell me that you can't afford me
Time to tell your dirty story
Time turning over and over
Time turning four leaf clover
Betting on the bull in the heather
10, 20, 30, 40
Tell me that you wanna scold me
Tell me that you adore me
Tell me that you're famous for me
Tell me that you're gonna score me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to sorely
Time to tell your love story
Time turning over and over
Time turning four leaf clover
Betting on the bull in the heather
 
Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls, they're playing on a jelly roll
Time to take a ride, time to take it in a midnight eye
And if you wanna go, get on below

Pinking out the day
Dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love
It's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road
And tell the story of the jelly rolling
Dirty boots are on
Hi di ho

Pinking out the black
Dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue
Now it's undone

I got some dirty boots
Yeah, dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby
Dirty boots
Hey
 
I can never forget you
The way you rock the girls
They rule the world and love you
A blast in the underworld
I stick a knife in my head
A-thinking 'bout your eyes
But now that you been shot dead
I got a new surprise

But I been waitin' for you just to say
The zoftig chick is mine
But all I know is you got no money
But that's got nothing to do with a good time

Can you forgive the boy who
Shot you in the head
Or should you get a gun and
Go and get revenge?
A 100% of my love
Up to you true star
It's hard to believe you took off
I always thought you'd go far

But I been around the world a million times
And all you men are slime
It gone to my head
Goodbye I am dead
Wastewood rockers is time for crime
Hey
 
Time takes its crazy toll
And how does your mirror grow?
You better watch yourself when you jump into it
'Cause the mirror's gonna steal your soul

I wonder how it came to be my friend
That someone just like you has come again
You'll never, never know how close you came
Until you fall in love with the diamond rain

Throw all his trash away
Look out, he's here to stay
Your mirror's gonna crack when he breaks into it
And you'll never, never be the same

Look into his eyes and you can see
Why all the little kids are dressed in dreams
I wonder how he's gonna make it back
When he sees that you just know it's make believe

Blood crystallized to sand
And now I hope you understand
You reflect into his looking glass soul
And now the mirror is your only friend

Look into his eyes and you will see
That men are not alone on the diamond sea
Sail into the heart of the lonely storm
And tell her that you'll love her eternally


Time takes its crazy toll
Mirror fallin' off the wall
You better look out for the looking glass girl
'Cause she's gonna take you for a fall

Look into his eyes and you shall see
Why everything is quiet and nothing's free
I wonder how he's gonna make her smile
When love is running wild on the diamond sea
 
To the extent that I wear skirts and cheap nylon slips
I've gone native
I wanted to know the exact dimensions of hell
Does this sound simple? Fuck you!
Are you for sale?
Does "Fuck you" sound simple enough?
This was the only part that turned me on
But he was candy all over

Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more

I grew up in a shotgun row sliding down the hill
Out front were the big machines
Steel and rusty now, I guess
Out back was the river
And that big sign down the road
That's where it all started

Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
 
Another can of worms
Another stomach turns
Yeah, your ghetto burns

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

You got a stupid man
You got a ku-klux-klan
Your fucking battle plan

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

A sieg heil-in' squirt
You're an impotent jerk
Yeah, a fascist twerp

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Black robe and swill
I believe Anita Hill
Judge will rot in hell

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Yeah a cross on fire
By a christian liar
A black attack on fire

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Yeah the president sucks
He's a war pig fuck
His shit is out of luck

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

Another nazi attack
A skinhead is cracked
My blood is black

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

We're banging pots and pans
To make you understand
We gonna bury you man

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

I'm a human wreck
A redneck in check
I killed the teacher's pet
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate
