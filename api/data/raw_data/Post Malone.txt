We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)

Take a second if you think about crossin' me
It lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for (What I stand for)
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war (You don't want war)

Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home128EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh-oh-oh

And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before

I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section, tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus
I know you remember (I know you remember)

Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)
Give her that pipe (Give her that, give her that pipe)
All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

Take it all away
Why don't you (Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me, yeah
(Take what you want) Why don't you (Take what you need)

Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace61EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
