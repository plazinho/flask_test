If you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a pornstar, a rockstar
Tryna skrrt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl, you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park

Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck, want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins

And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody
(I can't really fuck with nobody, so)
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

Ayy, ayy

I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
Nineteen with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy, I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, "Broski, you a star"
I said, "Brother, hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large"
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage
Now I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo

I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation
I could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated
For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated
Five racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas
Gnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb
Young niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us

I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose

She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope

Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm an ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push to start
Climb right in, let me break your heart
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober

Got the world on my shoulders

I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames, I
I'm not the one for the stupid shit
We shot a scene on some movie shit
And she came right through on some groupie shit
Be surprised how they act when they know you lit

I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro

Girl, never lie to me

Duck from the flashin' lights, watch out when the tide comin'
All these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really tell me somethin', ayy

Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'

Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

Rollin' cookie in L.A., I think I found my bae
She roll my weed, so she gonna be hard to replace
We takin' shots of that Henny, I don't need a chase
Almost forgot where I'm at, can barely feel my face
Rockstar lifestyle, might just die tonight
If I was down and had nobody, would you sacrifice?
They said loose ends break friends, I ain't tryna fight
Fuck bein' sober, girl, come over and enjoy the high
So don't fuck up the vibe, don't ever waste my time
And when I'm feelin' down, will you come stay the night?
And if you far away, then will you book a flight?
My neck flooded with ice, she grip it like a vice
Can't ever play it nice, the world so full of lies
And I'm not bein' them, 'cause I'm just not that guy
You wanna be somebody, so put aside your pride
So open up your eyes, they talkin' from outside
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'

Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

I just wanna talk to you, can we have discussion?
Why you frontin' on me, shawty, better stop the bluffin'
You better stop the bluffin', I really know you want it
You push that thing up on me, so I'ma jump up on it
I ain't gonna fake it because I know I want it
These niggas so 50, I keep my shit a hundred
Roll this Wood and we gettin' high
She say she love me, I know that's a lie

Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah

I don't think I love you, my emotions aren't the same
I'd rather be alone than go hangout with some lames
It's funny how they judge you when they see you made a change
I poured another four just to take away the pain
My friends weren't my friends, they was lookin' for some clout
I had what they wanted so they always came around
You told me you would be there but you never held it down
I'm out here bein' loyal, now I'm lookin' like a clown
I popped another Addy, now my heart is speedin' up
And I don't wanna love you, shorty, I just wanna fuck
Got angels on my shoulders, I got demons in my cup
I'm hardly ever out because it's hard for me to trust

Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

But I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
Roll a blunt and relax, ease your mind (Ease your mind)

Lock the doors, spill your heart, never lie (Never lie)
And they talk about me now 'cause I'm that guy (Guy)
They say I needed help but I did this by myself (By myself)
Smokin' all the time, hardly thinkin' 'bout my health
I just been alone, I'm not thinkin' that it helps
They threw me in a fire and expected me to melt
I came out a warrior, I had to make it last
I'm not the type to worry 'bout a problem in the past
And I just keep on movin' knowin' that I made this path
These bitches say they love you but will switch up for some cash
I put myself in college, I was taught that that was right
Well, now I'm 18 and I see that's not my life
I'm under too much pressure, feel like I can't take advice
You only live once, fuck the rules, I'm takin' flight
My niggas in the cage, free 'em out, fuck the law
I swear when they get out, on my life, we gonna ball
You wanna be a great, be yourself, fuck them all
Explain myself too much, now I'm feelin' lockjaw

Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here
But I can't do no fake friends (Fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake friends (Fake friends)

And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy
Getting money, I'm gone on a chase
Fuck a ho, I be stacking my cake
I'm no hero, they gave me the cape
First place when I finish the race
In her room and she giving me face
When I nut, she gon' give me my space
You a lame so you cannot relate
Hittin' licks, had to hide from the jakes
Crack the code, then I open the safe
Get my money, then go out the way
Charged up, I feel like triple-A
Think she loyal, I'm fucking your bae
Let 'em talk, I don't care what they say
Niggas pussy, be riding my wave
Ain't my nigga, then get off the stage
Kick that boy in his shit, Johnny Cage
Pom-pom ass nigga
Ol' Uncle Tom ass niggas
Boy, I don't wanna take a picture
All these niggas talking all on Twitter
Talkin' 'bout pulling up with hitters
You a goofy, just look at your image
I'm in the game like a scrimmage
Stack it up, I can't let it diminish
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large

Ayy, why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy

Ayy, and now you're my enemy
You said you was down to ride
But you're not a friend of me
In the game like a referee
I'm just getting what's meant for me
And they love to hate all the time
But these niggas pressed on me
And they tryna copy the swag
But they cannot get it from me
In the kitchen with recipes
Money long like a centipede
I got up and got it on my own
Be faded with destiny
And I'ma go get all the money
And do this for my family23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie
I play for keeps, fuck a loss and a damn tie
Grab my lean, smoke my weed, need some more Sprite
I've been down for a while, am I on your mind?
I don't really care too much, that's how I feel inside
I be smokin' all the time because it feels right
Niggas actin' like my bros and we ain't even tight

More ice
She wanna stay the night, tell lil shorty, "Catch a flight"
I was down in M-I-A fuckin' bitches, actin' trife
You wanna be my wife, ride it like you ride a bike
All this money in my hands, I'ma throw it on the ground
Like it when you back it up but better when you take it down
What don't break me only make me, smokin' OG out the pound
I got niggas that will shoot but if cops come don't make a sound
So, I sit back and watch, pray I see another day
Got Gucci with Supreme, shawty different in her way
Rock Chanel all the time, we go shoppin' in the Bay
East side in PA, they ain't loyal where I stay
So I'm out here layin' low, dodgin' vibes that I don't need
Everybody want somebody, don't confuse that with your needs
Send a message to my shorty, this ain't workin', gotta leave
I've been up, hardly sober, so let me
Roll this Backwood and let me get high
Keep this money by my side, I had to sacrifice
She say she love me, she don't love me, that's a damn lie

You actin' like my bro, but you really gonna fold
I ain't tryna make no friends, I've been lonely down this road
I've been ridin' through the Hills, takin' views through the scope
Thumbin' through this cash, yeah, flexin' on my ex
And I can't get no rest, nah, I'm tryna be my best
I'm a monster in the flesh, think she want me 'cause I'm next
And I don't worry 'bout her moves 'cause she know I ain't pressed
Lately I've been stressed, press reset
I've been in the mix, let me pop a Percocet
Baby, let's get drunk and fuck like we first met
And I ain't got no plans when you slide and send a text
Yeah, ayy, ayy

Oh she love me, no I can't relate
And they hate me cause I made a way
If you try me, I go where you stay
With my brothers pull up to the land
She gon' see me and fuck for the bands
I can't love you cause you is a fan
See me dancing, that's my money dance
I'm Italian, my shorty from France
I'm in Cali just getting a tan
Say she love me but follow my mans
Shawty high must be off of the xans
Say I rock and play her like a band
Just relax shawty hear what I'm saying
I got brothers like it's Taliban
It's a party, bring you and your friends
Need a coupe but my bro want a Benz
Fuck her sister, I thought they was twins
Fuck it, I'll probably do it again
Count my blessings, wake up, and I sin
I sip Henny, can't fuck with the gin
Sending shots, he won't aim for the rim
Sending shots, he won't aim for my brim
He a loser, I know he can't win
In all black and my car got the tint
Everyday I wake up and get bent
My life's crazy but I don't repent
Say he loyal, I know he gon' switch
Nigga either you real or a bitch
You a actor, just wanna be Mitch
Life's a game and my TV don't glitch
Rolling up watching Lilo and Stitch
I got juice and my shawty do too
She a rider, get high in my coupe
And I know niggas hate how I move
They be jealous and that is the truth
Boy I know I don't got shit to prove
She got blues, I ain't giving her clues
Pay attention, don't step on my shoes
I got swagger, don't mean to be rude
What, bitch I don't mean to be rude

And I know niggas hate how I move
Oh that nigga he say he a goon

She getting right off Bacardi
And now this girl acting so naughty
And I got my hands on her body
And she ride me, she feeling so jolly
And she know that these niggas can't stop me
I'm too humble for me to be cocky
I got a ho up in aki
I got a ho out the way
All these bitches be all in my face
Probably why they're easy to replace
Call my lawyer, I'm beating the case
I'm a loner, be needing my space
And these niggas want all of my plays
And these bitches be stuck in their ways
On my soul I don't talk to the Jakes
You a rat then you hang with the snakes
Niggas change when they come to the cake
Say they down but they really be fake
Tell my brothers I got 'em always
We was trapping in all the hallways
And we had to learn the hard way
And my life they wanna take it away
I got your ho on a J, yah
She be giving me neck, yah
All of these bitches be pressed, yah

Go 'head O
Ayy, I told them niggas like, look...
Danny, I see you

Ayy, ayy, I need twenty for a verse, I need forty for a show
I got bitches gettin' naked, throwin' money on the floor
Big Patek bust down, pussy hatin' 'cause he broke
I ain't never played the bench, I'm in the game and that's for sure
Claustrophobic, dropped the top, I had to switch lanes (skrrt)
My bitch is crazy, in her purse, she keep a switchblade
I'm out of town, still wear the chain like I'm Johnny Dang
I make it rain in your city, bring the world rage

Lifestyle on 300, Sparta's how we comin' (we comin')
Loverboy like I'm McLovin, I got bitches in London (woah)
You gon' take a chance and get nothin', niggas fake and be frontin' (they fake)
Whole crowd lit, fist-pumpin', on the stage, I'm jumpin' (jump, jump)
I get cash in abundance, know I made it from my grind
I was waitin' patiently, I knew this shit would take some time
She be sniffin' too much coco, she can't read between the lines
Fell in love with all the hype, now she don't wanna go outside
I bust down the wrist, now my time is full of ice
I bust up my clique, now my niggas livin' life
And you are full of shit if you think I would take advice
You were doin' all the wrong to make sure I was never right
Ayy, ayy, I need twenty for a verse, I need forty for a show
I got bitches gettin' naked, throwin' money on the floor
Big Patek bust down, pussy hatin' 'cause he broke
I ain't never played the bench, I'm in the game and that's for sure
Claustrophobic, dropped the top, I had to switch lanes (skrrt)
My bitch is crazy, in her purse, she keep a switchblade
I'm out of town, still wear the chain like I'm Johnny Dang
I make it rain in your city, bring the world rage

Ayy, and I can't be tamed, put this shit on replay (replay)
Run her hand all through my braids, she know I'm the new wave (the wave)
Lately I've been on this chase, dark shades, Blu-Ray (Blu-Ray)
You will never take up my space, I don't care what you say (you say)
I had to run it up
Don't think that you've done enough, I blew up like Mrs. Puff
Now they all wanna fuck with us, and these girls fall in love with us
Like no, no, no, no, no
I gotta let you go, go, go, go, go, for real12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Yeah, I'ma ride or die for the clique
Boy, I swear to God that I would die for this shit
That be Maaly Raw

I'ma ride or die for the clique
Grind with my brothers 'til we make it out the sticks
You a broke nigga, prolly switch up for a bitch
I was in the game, you was sittin' on the bench
Chillin' with my woes like we came up from the 6
I don't fuck with girls that be all up in the mix
Hear he sendin' threats and I ain't even hear the diss
I know I'm the one 'cause I got these niggas pissed
Make the shit look easy, I ain't have to make a wish

Ooh, do the dash in the whip
Got a .30 out like Curry, I just aim and I swish
Make her sing like a birdie, she take flights for the dick
Hit her with the long pipe, now she tryna have my kids
Ooh, little ho, I'm too legit
Caught up in this fast life, I don't ever wanna quit
You can save the sad stories, I ain't fallin' for that shit
I got diamonds, see me shinin', they all hittin', I don't miss
Ayy, Maaly Raw, we made a hit
Now they see me out in public, run up on me, takin' flicks
Nigga pressed about his shorty, I ain't worried 'bout his bitch
Boy, you better get some money 'fore you end up in a ditch (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hop in the coupe like oh, yeah
Turn on the radio, yeah
Baby, just let me know, yeah
I wanna bank the roll, yeah
I want the guap, the green, yeah
I want the purp, the lean, yeah
She wanna top the team, yeah
That is a thot to me, yeah
I got a Glock, a beam
I live the life you dream
I had to do it myself
'Cause these niggas not for me (Skrrt-skrrt)
These bitches make believe (Skrrt-skrrt)
Play games like hide and seek (Skrrt-skrrt)
I'ma keep bein' myself
'Cause that's how it's meant to be

I'ma ride or die for the clique
Grind with my brothers 'til we make it out the sticks
You a broke nigga, prolly switch up for a bitch
I was in the game, you was sittin' on the bench
Chillin' with my woes like we came up from the 6
I don't fuck with girls that be all up in the mix
Hear he sendin' threats and I ain't even hear the diss
I know I'm the one 'cause I got these niggas pissed
Make the shit look easy, I ain't have to make a wish
