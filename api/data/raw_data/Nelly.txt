Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on, now

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
"So when Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
"I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there"
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E

(Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo
I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won’t believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: "I can't help ya"
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why, why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, "wishing you was" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring, know they diss
Honies looking all "they wish," come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's

Hot shit (Hot shit)

Mmmmm, I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertaining
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit!)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the 'cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I’m Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover

Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Wild niggas, loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd, nigga
"How nigga?"
Ask me again and it's going down, nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown, nigga
Pound niggas, what you be giving when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talking that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with "Country Grammar"
Smoking blunts in Savannah, blow thirty mil', like I'm Hammer
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound

Let's show these cats to make these
Millions so you niggas quit acting silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon, talking really and I need it mon
Flows, I kick 'em freely mon, especially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holler at Beenie Man
See me, mon, chiefin', rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
With nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life, niggas
Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga
(Hot shit!) Ice, niggas, all over, close to never sober
From broke to having brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knocking like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now
I win now (Woo!), fucking lesbian twins now
Seeing now, through the pen I make my ends now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover

Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone

Right back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it
Time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, "Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?"
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

We can gamble to the break of dawn, nigga, money long, nigga
Pass up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga
Some say I'm wrong, but fuck it I'm grown, nigga
If you ain't 'bout money then best be gone, nigga
I'm flashy (uh), double takes when you walk past me
Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me
I drive fastly, call me Jeff Gord-on in the Black SS with the naviga-tion
See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an
Another one page-in, tellin' me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night
Ayo, I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin' icky. Let
Go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin' when the shows out, whatchu mean?!
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut, come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut, is you wit me?
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies
If you compare me to your local grocery, then
You'll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G, you can bag and scan me
Sure like Al B., meet the 'tics in Maui, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

St. Louis y'all, uh, uh

Uh, can you feel that?
Lunatics y'all, uh, uh

Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)

I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)

Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Come on)
Smile for me, daddy (Woo, what you looking at? Uh)
Let me see your grill (Let you see my what?)
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill

Big boys

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at
Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, "Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you Murph, especially in the white 'n blue"
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice"
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), "Thanks for the advice"

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, "NE" behind the "O"
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I think about it over and over again

And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it no

I can't wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before, we, said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing
Over and over again
Ho, but I think, she's leavin'
Aw, man, she's leavin'
And, I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
Yeah, and I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it no

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin' in my head
Over and over again play in my head
Over and over again
Ho, I think, she's leavin'
Aw, man, she's leavin'
And, I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, and I can't shake it no
Now, that I've realized
That I'm goin' down
From all this pain you've put me through
Everytime I close my eyes (woo)
I lock it down, ohh-hooo
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, no I can't shake it no
