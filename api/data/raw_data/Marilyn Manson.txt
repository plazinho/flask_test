We would swoop down on the town
Kill everyone that wasn't beautiful

And I don't want you and I don't need you
Don't bother to resist, or I'll beat you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
The weak ones are there to justify the strong
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
(Ah, ah)

The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
The horrible people, the horrible people
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple
Capitalism has made it this way
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
 
Devil's got a cut like a slit in a cattle's calf
Dollar-sign snakes, I'm all in the damn
God-less, fearless of the flood
Or the blood of the coming Spring
Something is shedding its scales
Crying from the heat of the light
Or the empty shell on the stage
"And cash is the poor man's money"
"And cash is the poor man's money"

You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"

Open your mouth, love
Like a gutted church
My goat horns are napalm trees
And a crown of thorns is hard to swallow
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?

You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"

Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Oh, you should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?

You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"
You say "GOD", I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"

Pound me the witch drums, witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

I'm the curled up fists
Dead and hardened spiders
Like two mangled crowns
On the white heads of the meanest coiled snakes
Folks say that I
Look like Death
Lived in the hotel of my eyes
Blinds wide open like a whore
Paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
Because now
Cupid carries a gun
Now, now
Cupid, Cupid carries a gun

Pound me the witch drums, witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

She had those crow-black eyes
Starless, but she fucked like a comet
She laid as still as a Bible
And it felt like Revelations when I looked inside

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
Because now
Cupid carries a gun
Now, now
Cupid, Cupid carries a gun

Pound me the witch drums, witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

It's like a stranger had a key, came inside my mind
And moved all my things around
He didn't know snakes can't kneel or pray
Can't try to break my psyche down

It's as if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?

Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep

The drugs, they say, make us feel so hollow
We love in vain, narcissistic and so shallow
The cops and queers, to swim, you have to swallow
Hate today, no love for tomorrow

We're all stars, now, in the dope show
We're all stars, now, in the dope show

There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

We're all stars, now, in the dope show
We're all stars, now, in the dope show

They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another

The drugs, they say, are made in California
We love your face, we'd really like to sell you
The cops and queers make good-looking models
I hate today, who will I wake up with tomorrow?

There's lot's of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another

I don't know if I can open up
I've been opened enough
I don't know if I can open up
I'm not a birthday present
I'm aggressive aggressive
The past is over
Now the passive seems so pathetic

Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?

I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
Lazarus got no dirt on me
Lazarus got no dirt on me
And I rise to every occasion
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles

Don't know if I cannot open up
I've been opened too much
Double-crossed and glossed over in my Pathos

Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?

I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker

Let's grab our gold switchblade
And make us a blood pact, babe
To love and to fuck
And to only see ourselves
And remember this

Your hotel room won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me

Bloody noses are just like roses
But what happens when we are betrayed?
Would you drag him to the shed
And unload six rounds in their fucking face?
This is our sacrifice

Your hotel-heart won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me

Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me

Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
 
"Some, you know, we need to find some help for you."

If you say that we're ill, give us your pill
Hope we'll just go away
But once you've inhaled death
Everything else is perfume
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
In the end, we all end up in a garbage dump
But I'll be the one that's holding your hand

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured

Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could be your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery
Marry with the left hand
So far, so far from the mad'ning crowd

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured

Am I a man or a show, or moment?
The man in the moon
Or a man of all seasons?
Will I be in at the kill
With you?

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured

We are sick

She's made of hair and bone and little teeth
And things I cannot speak
She comes on like a crippled plaything
Spine is just a string
I wrapped our love in all this foil
Silver tight like spider legs
I never wanted it to ever spoil
But flies will lay their eggs

Take your hatred out on me
Make your victim my head
You never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet

Prosthetic synthesis with butterfly
Sealed up with virgin stitch
If it hurts, baby, please tell me
Preserve the innocence
I never wanted it to end like this
But flies will lay their eggs

Take your hatred out on me
Make your victim my head
You never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet

What I wanted, what I needed
What I got for me
What I wanted, what I needed
What I got for me

Take your hatred out on me
Make your victim my head
You never ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet
Take your, take your, get up out of me
I'm not proud with me
I never, ever believed in me
I am your tourniquet
 
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

You built me up with your wishing hell
I didn't have to sell you
You threw your money in the pissing well
You do just what they tell you

Repent, that's what I'm talking about
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent, that's what I'm talking about
Whose mistake am I, anyway?

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you'll see your star

Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things

Repent (That's what he's talking about)
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent (That's what he's talking about)
Whose mistake am I, anyway?

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you'll see your star

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
The time has come, it is quite clear
Our Antichrist is almost here
The time has come, it is quite clear
Our Antichrist is almost here
The time has come, it is quite clear
Our Antichrist is almost here

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you'll see your star

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
When you are suffering know that I have betrayed you
 
This world doesn't need no opera
We're here for the operation
We don't need a bigger knife
Cause we got guns
We got guns, we got guns
We got guns, you better run
We're killing strangers

We're killing strangers
We're killing strangers so we don't kill the ones that we
Love, love, love, love

We pack demolition
We can't pack emotion
Dynamite, we just might
So blow us a kiss, blow us a kiss
Blow us a kiss, and we'll blow you to pieces


And we got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better, better run
We got, we got guns
Motherfuckers better run


You better run
We got guns, we got guns, we got guns
 
We've only reached the third day of our seven-day binge
And I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
I can't decide if you're wearing me out or wearing me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day of our seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
I've got bullets, in the booth
Rather be your victim, than be with you
I got bullets, in the Boothe
Rather be your victim, than be with you
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
I'd rather be your victim, than to be with you
Rather be your victim, than be with you
 
There's something cold and blank
Behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass
In her miracle mile

'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today
Today, to run away

A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut
And she was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a polaroid
That lost all her dolls

You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today
Today, to run away

A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today

A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
 
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
And all the children sing
We hate love, we love hate
"We hate love, we love hate!"
"We hate love, we love hate!"

I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim, you were the one who put the stick in my hand
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your God sort them out

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

I better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell
Better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

Everybody's someone else's nigg​er

So fuck your bible and your Babel
I made this psalm into my dirty bomb
So dance, motherfucker, dance
Racing to a red light

I'm un-stabled, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course
I'm un-scabbed and un-regretted
I got tattooed in reverse
Woah, in reverse

You can't play this game, you've lost all the pieces
Hold your breath and just wait
(I'm sure) Someone else will pay for your sins
But I'm not convinced by your costume
This ain't my goddamn cup of tears

I'm un-stabled, I'm not a show horse
I can't be bridled, of course
I'm un-scabbed and un-regretted
I got tattooed in reverse
Woah, got tattooed in reverse

Your confession means nothing
So fuck your attrition
There ain't nothing in my hourglass
Just sand from a dead sea
And I made it my weapon
And I made it my weapon
Your confession means nothing
So fuck your attrition
There ain't nothing in my hourglass
Just sand from a dead sea
And I made it my weapon

Fuck your bible and your Babel

2005 Against All Gods Mix:
I don't know love, I never cared to and I'm not sure if I ever will
I'm a student of hate. I know now that god is a medium
Whatever I expected to save me from this life is no longer the one I can hate
It is the people that made me; it is the people I wanted so much to be
I may only find love in their destruction
Original Mix:

Ailanrutas si siht

When all your demons die
Even if just one survives
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are
I see the terror in your teardrop
Take your belief
Make it snow, let go
And wait together until we thaw

I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road
I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road

Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

A stunning possession of symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scar
A stunning possession of symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scar

I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road
I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road

So, just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
And I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

Si siht ailanrutas

By the roadside, all the bones picked clean
No gas in our machine
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold we are
Can't stop now, no flowers to smell
The Earth ate up the Son, can't even load my gun
It seems like Saturnalia

Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia

There's no exit plan here
No emergency room in this tomb
And this door only opens one way
There's no exit plan here
No emergency room in this tomb
And this door only opens one way

Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia

Blinded by blackness, we're just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset
Blinded by blackness, just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset
 
Your world is an ashtray, we burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry, your ashes turn to mud
The nature of the leeches, the virgin's feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of your life

My world is unaffected
There is an exit here, I say it is and it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead

I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me
Saw Heaven and Hell were lies
When I'm God, everyone dies

Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller

Let's jump upon the sharp swords
And cut away our smiles
Without the threat of death
There's no reason to live, at all

My world is unaffected
There is an exit here, I say it is and it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead
I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me
Saw Heaven and Hell were lies
When I'm God, everyone dies

Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Each thing I show you is a piece of my death

No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness
This is beyond your experience
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
Forgiveness

I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me
Saw Heaven and Hell were lies
When I'm God, everyone dies

Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller

Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
