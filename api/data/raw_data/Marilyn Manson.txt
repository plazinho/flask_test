We would swoop down on the town
Kill everyone that wasn't beautiful

And I don't want you and I don't need you
Don't bother to resist, or I'll beat you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
The weak ones are there to justify the strong
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
(Ah, ah)

The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
The horrible people, the horrible people
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple
Capitalism has made it this way
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (Ah)

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

Devil's got a cut like a slit in a cattle's calf
Dollar-sign snakes, I'm all in the damn
God-less, fearless of the flood
Or the blood of the coming Spring
Something is shedding its scales
Crying from the heat of the light
Or the empty shell on the stage
"And cash is the poor man's money"
"And cash is the poor man's money"

You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"

Open your mouth, love
Like a gutted church
My goat horns are napalm trees
And a crown of thorns is hard to swallow
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?

Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores

Pound me the witch drums, witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

I'm the curled up fists
Dead and hardened spiders
Like two mangled crowns
On the white heads of the meanest coiled snakes
Folks say that I
Look like Death
Lived in the hotel of my eyes
Blinds wide open like a whore
Paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
Because now
Cupid carries a gun
Now, now
Cupid, Cupid carries a gun
Pound me the witch drums, witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

She had those crow-black eyes
Starless, but she fucked like a comet
She laid as still as a Bible
And it felt like Revelations when I looked inside

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
Because now
Cupid carries a gun
Now, now
Cupid, Cupid carries a gun

Pound me the witch drums, witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?

Yeah

It's like a stranger had a key, came inside my mind
And moved all my things around
He didn't know snakes can't kneel or pray
Can't try to break my psyche down

It's as if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?
Do you like our bed?

Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep

The drugs, they say, make us feel so hollow
We love in vain, narcissistic and so shallow
The cops and queers, to swim, you have to swallow
Hate today, no love for tomorrow

We're all stars, now, in the dope show
We're all stars, now, in the dope show

There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

We're all stars, now, in the dope show
We're all stars, now, in the dope show

They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
The drugs, they say, are made in California
We love your face, we'd really like to sell you
The cops and queers make good-looking models
I hate today, who will I wake up with tomorrow?

There's lot's of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another

There's lots of pretty, pretty ones

I don't know if I can open up
I've been opened enough
I don't know if I can open up
I'm not a birthday present
I'm aggressive aggressive
The past is over
Now the passive seems so pathetic

Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?

I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
Lazarus got no dirt on me
Lazarus got no dirt on me
And I rise to every occasion
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles

Don't know if I cannot open up
I've been opened too much
Double-crossed and glossed over in my Pathos
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?

I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker

Let's grab our gold switchblade
And make us a blood pact, babe
To love and to fuck
And to only see ourselves
And remember this

Your hotel room won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me

Bloody noses are just like roses
But what happens when we are betrayed?
Would you drag him to the shed
And unload six rounds in their fucking face?
This is our sacrifice
Your hotel-heart won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me

Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
"Some, you know, we need to find some help for you."

If you say that we're ill, give us your pill
Hope we'll just go away
But once you've inhaled death
Everything else is perfume
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
In the end, we all end up in a garbage dump
But I'll be the one that's holding your hand

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured

Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could be your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery
Marry with the left hand
So far, so far from the mad'ning crowd

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
Am I a man or a show, or moment?
The man in the moon
Or a man of all seasons?
Will I be in at the kill
With you?

We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
