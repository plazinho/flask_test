Every time I dive in my pool, it's hard to be humble
When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel
And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi
Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties
They give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is
I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party
Next they wash my body as a team
And they say "Foo, your royal penis is clean!"
And I'm like

Step outside and say hello to my beautiful world
Grandma's cooking breakfast; she makes pancakes the best
I check my MySpace and I've got a lot of friend requests
Yes!
I get to dancing as I, walk through my mansion cause I
Own property from California to the Hamptons and I
Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah
I check to see how my album's doing today
The group LMFAO goes double platinum, hey

So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like

Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick

They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that's why I dress so fresh, kid
You see that girl over there she big chested
Let's start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, "I'm molested! "

Shot clock, three seconds left, I'm just gettin' started
And yo team out of breath
I juke right, fake to the left, pop, shot, count it, all night
I'm gettin' threes like I'm...
I think I might just top the team
Cause I've got the green
That's how I play in the league
And now I'm gonna be MVP, Sky Blu baby

Either way I style on them all day make way
Put a smile for the women unless they know I don't play
People movin when I wake up and possessin' the best shit
Always the first to do with introducing the next shit

To tell the truth a lot of nigga's need a background check, yo
Could give a fuck about your cute buzz
I return in case you may know who the truth was
And when you on the soundtrack and you ain't saying nothin'
I'm in a club bottle-sippin' and the bitches is jumpin'
When we step up in the buildin' and you see how we get it
And watch all of my nigga's back 'till you know how we did it
Throw it all up in the street just see the kid on a roll
And let me bang with this shawty when I take it to the hole

Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole

You ain't got no onions, got no peppers

Sipping on this drink, got some time to think
About where I was, and where am I'm at today
I'm getting everything I ask for
Flying the world, filling up my passport
I'm in the zone, martini's strong, my time is short, but my money long
I'm getting everything I ask for, In the club, always keep my glass full

Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day

Hey, everybody came to play
I love it when the DJ plays all my favorite songs
And everybody sings along
I see the pretty babies at the pool, but all I can think about is you

Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day

When I get you girl, you gonna be so in love with me
Every day, we're gonna play, what's your fantasy?
Every night I think of you in every way
And when I get you, I'mma celebrate
Hey, I'mma celebrate
I'mma celebrate
I'm gonna celebrate
'Cause I'm gonna get you one day
 
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it

Most girls I meet are quite savage
Always tryin' to grab up on my package
They say I look yummy and they want a taste
But I'm a human, not a sandwich
Sometimes I feel like LL Cool J
I need love not random booty
But every girl I try to get to know
Ends up tryin' to do me

I said
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it

Sometimes, I just wanna dance
Girl I know you like my style
But get your hand out my pants

I am not a whore
(No no no)
I am not a whore
(I'm not your hoe)
I am not a whore
(I just love the music)
I am not a whore
(But I like to do it)

I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
 
She never been on a flight
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in Italy
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention in here
She put my hands on her body
And then she whispers in my ear

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

I hope this ain't a dream
This better not be no dream
Please don't let this be a simulation
It better be real
Cause you're a pretty thing
You a motherfucking sexy thing
I hope it's not my imagination
It better be real
I'm dancing on the floor (yeah on the floor)
I'm dancing with you, girl (ooh)
We spinning round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love
I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my moves
On Saturday, on Saturday Night Fever (break free)
Now that I got you
Girl, I won't never leave you alone, alone, alone
Call you on my phone
Baby let's party the night away
I'm dancing with you
I wanna party with you, girl

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she's never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like you're the man
But deep in your heart, you know she's a fan
Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spitting at her
T-pain's winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys getting at her
What's the matter? Oh nothing
I reply straight, but fronting, wrapped in bottles, started chucking
She grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dancefloor
We dance close, and then she put my hands low
Oh, I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss 'til the morning light

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...

It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you

Yes, party people, we drop and feet go
To make your fist-pump, hands up and feet go
Crazy, look at all these ladies, tonight is going down
Going down, Mayday!
We party rocking' in this place for sho'
Every place that we walk in is the place to go
Popping bottles up for free, with the models every week
Sexy go-gos the way your booty bobbles to the beat it's like:
On and popping, ain't no stopping, that bass is knocking
Them shots are dropping, some of us came to celebrate
But most of us came to get away

It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

I'm a heavyweight
Light on my feet, watch me levitate
Sex tape, watch me penetrate
Then I slap you in the ass let it resonate
I'm living with the finer things
Designer draws, and diamond rings
Go to the mall, lots of things
I stay the same, call it pocket change, nigga (Pocket change, nigga)
I never ever been a bitch, my last girl was, so player had to switch
Probably only with me cause I'm rich, now she only on my booty call list
Yeah, mo money don't stop the show
But she still can ride my banana boat
She still can ride my banana boat
Now her new nick name is banana throat
Clear it out
I'm the one everybody here about, man you're just here for now
So simmer down, Verizon flow, you hear me now
I'm always up to something, we got Goon in the house cause he my cousin
We got dimes by the dozens, but without you girl, I'm nothing

Everybody's on the floor, I can see your hands up
From the stage to the door
Calvin Harris on the decks
LMFAO is on the checks
One, two in the place to be
It pays to be, what's happening next
Baby you look so fine, I can tell with that look in your eye
That me and you in the bathroom
Has crossed your mind
I rock a chain on my chest
Cause I'm fresh to the death
And everyday I'm shuffling, I'm like a soldier with these steps
It's on and popping, there ain't no stopping
That bass is knocking, the shots are dropping
Some of us came to celebrate, but most of us came to get away

It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you
 
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

Just cause a guy got a suit and a tie don't mean he gonna tax ya
Just cause I walk with a limp like an old school pimp don't mean I'll slap ya
But if you wanna talk tough, and you wanna puff up, then I might just have to
But I ain't come here to clock your mouth, (no!) I came here to rock the house (ho!)
Yeah, I get crazy wild, anything for the fans to make them smile
Goose and girls, that's my style, if you think I'm a thug, then you in denile
But you know when push come to shove, we protect ourselves and the ones we love
Stay at home, sit and judge, or celebrate life and hit the club

Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight's our night

We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

They call you suit and tie, you's a politician
They call me super-fly, I'm always with two bitches
You go to church ties, I grew up with them scriptures
You on your P's and Q's, I'm sippin' Jeezy Juice
We both get a lot of attention in the press
You sellin' books and wanna be the President
We sellin' hooks, and the flow is heaven sent
We both hustlin', so why we tusslin'?

Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight's our night

We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life
We came here to party (Rock)
We didn't come here to fight

A short time ago
In a galaxy closely, closely near (Is it closely?)
(Yeah, it's closely, just keep the evil voice!)
Oh, oh, I'm sorry for party rocking
I've been sipping on that whiskey all day (Just read it!)
Two men emerged out of the muck
April 1, 2007, April Fools' Day
It marked the birth of a new sound, Party Rock
And what we do is rock the beat!
(It's going down!)
'Cause we LMFAO, rock the beat and rock the show
Move your feet onto the floor, start to freak and drink some more
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
If you came to party put your motherfucking hands up!
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
If you came to party put your motherfucking hands up!
 
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because

Yo, it was all a dream, I used to play chess at the coffee bean
And as my coffee steamed I thought about my life and my lofty dreams
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to AM; rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays, to make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me the secret, popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin' you achivin', after that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes
We party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots
Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast are feelin' good, ha-ha LMFAO
I'm a pro with this party thang
I love Cherry Tree Cola and Bacardi mayne
Hey, I've been the same before the start of fame
The only that has changed is we changed the game
You and I and the crew that I roll with
It's gonna be the the same crew I grow old with
Memories fade like old leather
But the music that we make gonna last forever... legacy

It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because

(Check it)
I feel like flyin', on top of my game and I ain't even tryin'
Nowadays I'm stylin' and when she naked it I feel like cryin'
It's better than I hoped it'd be
I walk down the street and people notice me
No body was as broke as me
They say you never get nowhere smokin' weed
So I roll one up I stepped on a landmine blowin' up
And I ain't never growin' up
And if the party rocks then you know it's us
Me and foo in the club straight posted-up
Back when I wasn't old enough
Now bottles on ice when we rollin' up
Cheers, a toast to us
Oh, we winnin' now
My whole life's changed since then and now
Fans show love and women shout
Make me feel like I'm the man
All of my friends n' my fans say don't let em change you
Been from London to Japan and I'm still the same dude
And he's still the same Foo
Struggles we came through
Stuck with our team and our dream and look how it came true

It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
It's crazy, I never want this feeling to end
This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
(Check it, check it, check it out)
All my dreams come true because
