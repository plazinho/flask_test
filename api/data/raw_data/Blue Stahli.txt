BRET: Hm... Guitar? Guitar! Yes
BRET: Little more chin! Little more chin! Little more chin! That's enough chin!

(U-U-ULTRAnumb)
(Three!)
(Two! One!)
You want it all right now! (ULTRAnumb)
Right now! Three! Two! One! (ULTRAnumb)
One!
One!

(Three, two, one, you want it full frontal, overstimulation)
So say a benediction for a new addiction in voyeuristic overdrive (here comes the countdown!)

(Three!) This is the new flesh,  (two!) this is the open door
(One!) We've got everything you wanted
You want it all right now! (ULTRAnumb)
Right now! (Three! Two! One!)

Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)

(Three, two, one, reality's a plague, we're the medication)
A new manipulation, oversaturation, take advantage of what you deny (here comes the countdown!)

(Three!) So step right up and see (two!) the possibilities
(One!) We are everything you wanted
You want it all right now! (ULTRAnumb)
Right now! (Three! Two! One!)

Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)

One confession (confession)
Is such perfection (perfection)
Your sweet repression (repression)
Can't hide who you really are

Say you love it, say you hate it, doesn't matter 'cause you're all the same
Say you want it, say you need it, come and get it 'cause we love the shame
Say you love it, say you hate it, just another one to suck the fame
Don't pretend that you're better than this, malevolence goes both ways

(Three! Two! One!) (U-U-ULTRAnumb)
(One!)

MARIACHI CRISTAL: ¿Está listo señor?

(Three! Two! One!)

Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)
Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)
 
Another command to succumb to sucking you off with a smile
A vanity culture like a congregation
Identity dogmatism, the image is always in style
Stroking the ego with media masturbation
Conditioning to canonize
Gospel of this vox populi
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I want to be the anti you
A singular definition of what it's supposed to be like
An arrogant principle of validation
You're pushing the masochism, we're never to question the hive
I'll be the nemesis of expectation
Refusing to regurgitate
Accuse and excommunicate
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I want to be the anti you
Anti you
This narcissism is a system to intimidate
Perpetuating, overcompensating your self-hate
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I've got nothing to prove
Force feeding, misleading
I'm burning the altar and I'll pass right through
Erasing, debasing
I want to be the anti you
 
A crumbling altar, how dim the glow
Buried it far below
Stumble and falter within the bone
As heaven is overthrown

In every direction we're torn apart
So ineffectual

Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame

Eternal horizon, salt the earth
Sever the nearest nerve

A fading reflection to pierce the heart
Of what’s amendable

Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame

Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of
Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame
 
Bring it down to the wire
Parasite messiahs
Set them all on fire
Bring it down to the wire
And scrape
Bring it down to the wire
Parasite messiahs
Set them all on fire
Bring it down to the wire
And scrape

They force it in and you swallow
Like words and cheap advice
I'll burn it all just to light your eyes
Skin-tight rewards and vendetta (Vendetta)
Round zero in a desperate light
I love the violence inside your mind

Bring it down to the wire
Parasite messiahs
Set them all on fire
And scrape
Scrape (Want you)
Scrape (Need you)
Scrape (Break you)
Bring it down to the wire

There is an art to infliction
Head-spill and homicide
I'll burn it all just to light your eyes
All that you dream of, they're ruined
My sweet little libertine
We'll mix it all with gasoline

Bring it down to the wire
Parasite messiahs
Set them all on fire
And scrape
Scrape (Want you)
Scrape (Need you)
Scrape (Break you)
Bring it down to the wire

Witches got some vicious candy kisses for apocalypse
Watch it closer as it's slipping away
Naked trigger finger, make linger just below the hips
Watch it fall as humanity is spiraling down
To the ground

Bring it down to the wire
Parasite messiahs
Set them all on fire
And scrape
Scrape (Want you)
Scrape (Need you)
Scrape (Break you)
Bring it down to the wire
Bring it down, bring it down to the wire!
Scrape
Scrape
Scrape
Bring it down to the wire!
Scrape (Want you)
Parasite messiahs (Need You)
Scrape (Break you)
Set them all on fire

Bring it
Down!
 
I feel it right at the heart of me
And it grips me physically
Dragging down so far below
And it's a violent vertigo
Digging it in like a parasite
Feeding off what I keep inside
Manifest when I'm throwing trust
To the cold and the nebulous

Something's changing
Rearranging me
Just beginning
My own surgery

I'll cut away everything
And tear away everything
Confining, defining
I'll cut away everything
And tear away everything
And I'll escape myself

I cast off what it means to be
Ruled by the happening
Moving past the experience
Never dwell on the evidence
Breaking it off of the identity
I come and kill it when I contravene
I'm dissolving all of this
In the full metamorphosis

Something's changing
Rearranging me
Amputating
What I no longer need

I'll cut away everything
And tear away everything
Confining, defining
I'll cut away everything
And tear away everything
And I'll escape myself

I'll cut away everything
And tear away everything
Confining, defining
I'll cut away everything
And tear away everything
And I'll escape myself
I'll cut away everything (cutting away)
And tear away everything (tearing away)
Confining, defining
I'll cut away everything (cutting away)
And tear away everything (tearing away)
And I'll escape myself
 
You've bought all the happiness
But you still want more
Parade all that you possess
Though there's no one keeping score
Dreaming of vertigo
From the highest fame
Feeling the undertow
When it starts to break

Everything will fall away
Some day
All that's real is what remains
To always

A cage of the tangible
All you had to own
You poor social cannibal
What's left when you lose the throne?
We're of the same affair
Pride before the fall
We'll see what's truly there
When it takes us all

Everything will fall away
Some day
All that's real is what remains
To always
Everything will fall away
Some day
All that's real is what remains
To always
 
Feel me in the corner, oh, beside your mouth
Feel me in the inside of the faintest trace of sound
It's fire underwater, breathing while you drown
Feel me in the saturation when the sun burns out
'Cause I am the one inside you
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again
Far beyond the bruising, something underneath
Feel me in the aftermath when you learn the world has teeth
'Cause I am the one inside you
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again
There is so much more to this than
Phantom limbs for amputees
Here, dissolving through the trauma
This is where you'll feel the breath of me
(I am the one inside you)
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again
'Cause I am the one inside you
And I am the one (Inside your veins)
'Cause I am the one inside you
Over and over I'm here again
Here again!
 
Shame
Wear the pity and the blame
Basking in the glow
A lovely crown of thorns
Cliche
Overdramatic display
An unwelcome show
Of steady undertow

You'll make 'em watch while you go down in flames
Self-inflicted pretty little martyr
If forcing empathy is as clever as you can be
We'll gladly watch while you go down in flames
Burn, baby, burn!

Vain
You're the Abel and the Cain
No coincidence
You crave an audience
Stray
Committed to the decay
Fake mercy pose
And on and on it goes

You'll make 'em watch while you go down in flames
Self-inflicted pretty little martyr
If forcing empathy is as clever as you can be
We'll gladly watch while you go down in flames
Burn, baby, burn!

You'll make 'em watch while you go down in flames
Self-inflicted pretty little martyr
If forcing empathy is as clever as you can be
We'll gladly watch while you go down in flames
Burn, baby, burn!
 
They tell you that you're staying here
In white walled observation
It's terminal or so they fear
Well-meaning resignation

Whenever you feel that the world is a lie
A cruel and merciless hope homicide
You gotta fight it with everything you have inside

You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of

Adversity, a souvenir
To spark your transformation
Tenacity is growing near
And here's the inspiration

Whenever you feel that the world is a lie
A cruel and merciless hope homicide
You gotta fight it with everything you have inside

You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of

You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
 
Lost in the time
In the way, gone but not forgotten
New secret crimes
To repay, now the walls have fallen

And so it's now or never

I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties that hold me down
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy

Caught quicksand grip
Pull me in, whisper faith in sickness
Soon kill the myth
I'll begin, be the first to witness

And so it's now or never

I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties that hold me down
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy

I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties that hold me down
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy
 
Forcing of the hand, a whisper in the ear
Spirit of enabling
Sinister command of what I want to hear
I'm the only one who pulls my strings

I'm the devil living in the pride
I'm the devil, no one's hands are tied
I'm the devil, damnation dignified
I'm the devil and it's only me inside

Why would you pretend your will is not your own
Claiming something pushed you there?
Don't mean to condescend but it's you and you alone
You're the architect of your despair

And I'm the devil living in the pride
I'm the devil, no one's hands are tied
I'm the devil, damnation dignified
I'm the devil and it's only me inside

I'm the devil living in the pride
I'm the devil, no one's hands are tied
I'm the devil, damnation dignified
I'm the devil and it's only me inside
I'm the devil, damnation dignified
I'm the devil and it's only me inside

(Go!)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)

On endless floors and corridors
Weak but not broken
And through the rust it's hunting us
The last breath is spoken

You'll never stop me, stop me
I'll bring an army with me
It's never over, over
And it's not over 'til we say so

(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)

It keeps us here and knows our fear
Our kindred divider
So stand up to the past we knew
We'll scream through the wires

You'll never stop me, stop me
I'll bring an army with me
It's never over, over
And it's not over 'til we say so

You'll never stop me, stop me
I'll bring an army with me
It's never over, over
And it's not over 'til we say so
You'll never stop me, stop me (Ah-ah)
I'll bring an army with me (Ah-ah)
It's never over, over (Ah-ah-ah)
And it's not over 'til we say so
 
We are thrown away
In the house you made of every stolen moment
Don't pretend
I know how this ends, and who you are in secret
All our hopes are fast asleep
Spill the wrist of what you'll never be
And I'll never say that everything's alright
That when we're gone we'll sleep with satellites
We're killing more than the loneliness behind the eyes
Sometimes the best you can do is just survive
Something's wrong inside
We are feeding flies with pieces of ambition
Prison skin
Keeps us safety pinned
(I'll whisper your incision)
Hostile strum and icepick tongue
Shelter here from everyone
And I'll never say that everything's alright
That when we're gone we'll sleep with satellites
We're killing more than the loneliness behind the eyes
Sometimes the best you can do is just survive
...Just survive
 
Takedown!

I break through
What you view
Just to counteract
Kamikaze crash dive when I fight back
Whatcha' gonna do?
Whatcha' gonna say?
When I wipe the smile right off of your face

Right now
Break out
Takedown

I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you’d make a beautiful suicide

Don't speak
Doublethink
Who you push around
You're mistaken
If you’re thinking that I'll back down
Whatcha' gonna do?
Whatcha' gonna say?
When I give back all the hate you made

Right now
Break out
Takedown

I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you'd make a beautiful suicide
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you'd make a beautiful suicide
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you out
I wanna be the one to break your dignity
And all your empty pride
Will rot the hole inside
But you'd make a beautiful suicide

Ill!
 
Seven million strung out on ambition
Sea of relay high rise in remission
All with a hope and a plan to make it out
Give up the ghost when they try to push it down
Now

Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire

Die a thousand deaths in hesitation
Far beyond the spark of inspiration
Close to the soul and away from all the doubt
Live what is known when you hear the softest sound
Say

Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire

Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire

Fire
Ready, aim, fire
Fire
Fire
 
Come on!
Uh!

I am the beast
I am the earth
I am the blood that fills the sky
I am the feast
Of famine thirst
And every will to justify

(Come on, come on!)
(C-c-come on!)
(Come on, come on!)

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

Armageddon, come, come and get it!
Armageddon, baby (uh!)
Armageddon, come, come and get it!
Armageddon

I am the flesh
I am the flame
A temple to carnality
We are enmeshed
Sacred, profane
Reflected through brutality

(Come on, come on)
(C-c-come on)
(Come on, come on)

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

Armageddon, come, come and get it!
Armageddon, baby (uh!)
Armageddon, come, come and get it!
Armageddon

(Come on!)
(Come on!)
(Come on!)

It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon
It's every day and every night
My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right
Back for more, it's Armageddon

Armageddon, come, come and get it!
Armageddon, baby
Armageddon, come, come and get it!
Armageddon
 
So love is a border town abortion
Elimnate everything I thought that I knew
I'm blindsided by a genocide decision
I'm just a bit jilted and giving the devil her due
Sucked in by insincerity
(It's what you wanted, this is what you will get)
Fucked by indulgent vanity
(It's what you wanted, this is what you will get)
So shallow - so hollow
Not buying what you're trying to sell
Well so long, and farewell
It's not goodbye, 'cause I'll see you in Hell
...See you in Hell!
You deserve every bit of what you're getting
I'm burning the bridge but you started the flame
If you think that this is all a bit excessive
The empathy and the intergrity -
Matched what you gave
I can't wash out your aftertaste
(It's what you wanted, this is what you will get)
From when you showed your second face
(It's what you wanted, it's what you'll get)
So shallow - so hollow
Not buying what you're trying to sell
Well so long, and farewell
It's not goodbye, 'cause I'll see you in Hell
...See you in Hell!
In full devotion
I forgot my fears to comfort yours
I guess recovery means
You don't need me anymore... Yeaow!
So shallow - so hollow
Not buying what you're trying to sell
Well so long, and farewell
You only loved yourself...
So shallow - so hollow
Not buying what you're trying to sell
Well so long, and farewell
It's not goodbye, 'cause I'll see you in Hell
...See you in Hell!
 
They force it in and you swallow
Black words and cheap goodbyes
I'll burn it all just to light your eyes
Skin-tight rewards and vendetta
Ground zero in a desperate life
I love the violence between your thighs
CHORUS:
Bring it down to the wire
Parasite, oh messiahs
Set them all on fire
And scrape
There is an art to infliction
Head-spill and homicide
I'll burn it all just to light your eyes
All that you dream of, they're ruined
My sweet little libertine
We'll fix it all with gasoline
CHORUS
 
I said, "Lord, Lord, Lord, it's a long dark road"
And my tongue's a sword when speaking gold
In my deep down soul, I am flies and blood
And it's black as coal in this heart of mud

And they say, "You got a demon"

And I'm home sweet home like a herd of swine
And the seeds I've sown, well they're mine, all mine
They're down so low, in floorboard rest
There's a great big hole straight through my chest

And they say, "You got a demon
You got a demon, you got a demon"

Hey-ey-yeah
He-e-ey-yeah
Hey-ey-yeah
He-e-ey-yeah
