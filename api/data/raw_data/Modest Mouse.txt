I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright
Already, we'll all float on
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright
Already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, we'll all float on

(Alright, already) And we'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on 
Alright, already, we'll all float on 
Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on 
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on 
Alright, already, we'll all float on (Alright!) 
Now don't you worry, we'll all float on (Alright!)
We'll all float on35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

My boss just quit the job
Says he's going out to find blind spots
And he'll do it

The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand

Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
Baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath

Ice age heat wave, can't complain
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door, and again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you've still got your words and you've got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder, work another way
Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?

The days get shorter and the nights get cold
I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot, but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising, but it's spring and I should leave
I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside, water, like air, was gray
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plan
You said that you did, but you didn't understand
I know that starting over's not what life's about
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth, but still cough down our sleeves

Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Woke up this morning, and it seemed to me
That every night turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

Well, we sat on the edge of the river
The crowd screamed, "Sacrifice the liver!"
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver
So tell me now why, you'll tell me never
Who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Well, see what you want to see
You should see it all
Well, take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten
Our hearts just get dissolved
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
Here we go
If God controls the land and disease
And keeps a watchful eye on me
If he's really so damn mighty
Well, my problem is I can't see
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Evil home stereo
What good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know
What good curves can you throw?

Well, all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake, okay?

I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, don't think so

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Well I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I hope so

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile
Well, that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw, and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
(You missed)
When the Earth folded in on itself (You missed)
And said "Good luck, for your sake I hope Heaven and Hell
(You missed, you missed)
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well, I don't mind, I don't mind
How the hell could I mind?

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Well, that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste the afterlife?21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate, of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids, of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything

And I shout that you're all fakes (Fakes)
And you should've seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your bellyaches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you

Sometimes all I really want to feel is love
Sometimes I'm angry that I feel so angry
Sometimes my feelings get in the way
Of what I really feel I needed to say

If you sit in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but he's lost the joke now
Our communications come in one lined jokes
From stand up comics and rock musicians
Making so much noise you don't know when to listen

Why are you judging people so damn hard?
You're taking your point of views a bit too far
I made my shoes shine with black coal
But the polish didn't shine the hole

If you sit in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but he's lost the joke now
Our communications come in one lined jokes
From stand up comics and rock musicians
Making so much noise you don't know when to listen
Think it over
There's the air of the height of the highrollers
Think it over
You ain't got nothing until you know her7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
From the top of the ocean, yeah
From the bottom of the sky, goddamn
Well, I get claustrophobic
I can, you know that I can, well
From the top of the ocean, yeah
From the bottom of the sky, goddamn
Well, I get claustrophobic
I can, you know that I can

And he said
"I am not allowed much danger
Keep in line, you're an old friend, stranger
You'll burn me in effigy and I'll burn you in effigy"
Well, a rattlesnake up in Buffalo, Montana
He bit the leg of the old sheriff
Ha, that boy fell down on his harelip—Oh, oh
Well I, I might be wrong
But you, you tag along
And we, we've all been wronged
And I feel dizzier by the mile
Said, "Hell yeah, the money's spent"
Went to the county line and paid the rent
I said, "Uh-oh", I said "Uh-oh"
Oh, if you could compact your conscience
Oh, and you might
Oh, if you could bottle and sell it, you might have done
Oh, and you might
Oh, if you could compact your conscience
And sell it, save it for another time
You know you might have to use it

And the television's on
Go to the grocery store, buy some new friends
And find out the beginning, the end, and the best of it
Well, do you need a lot of what you got to survive?

Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles, shimmers, shines
Let's all have another Orange Julius
Thick syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon-to-be ghost towns
Well, so long, farewell, goodbye

Take 'em all for the long ride
And you'll go 'round town
No one wants to be uptight anymore
You could be ashamed or be so proud of what you've done
But not no one, not now, not ever or anyone
Take 'em all for the sad, sad happiness
That comes from hurting deep down inside
Or you could add it up and give a shit, give a shit
Go to the family doctor
It's all worth it, all worth and it's
All, all wrong, and it's all, all gone
Or you could add it up and give a shit, give a shit
I'm on the corner of this and this and this and it's
All, all wrong, and it's all, all wrong

Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles, shimmers, shines
Let's all have another Orange Julius
Thick syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon-to-be ghost towns
Well, so long, farewell, goodbye

And the telephone goes off
Pick the receiver up, try to meet ends
And find out the beginning, the end and the best of it
Oh my, God damn

Take 'em all for the long ride
And you'll go 'round town
No one wants to be uptight anymore
You could be ashamed or be so proud of what you've done
But not no one, not now, not ever or anyone9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
The room lit up and we ran about
Well, this is what I'd really call a party now
Packed up our cars, moved to the next town
Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
This is what I'd really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
This one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
Shaved off my eyebrows, let 'em fall to the ground
So I can't look surprised right now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Burn it up or just chop it down
This one's done so where to now?

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going
Well, the lampshade's on fire when the lights go out
This is what I really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
Ah, this one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
The room lights up, well, we're still dancing around
We're having fun, having some fun now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Open one up and let it fall to the ground
Pile out the door when it all runs out

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

We have spines and other bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw stones
Oh, this is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Well, we're the human race
We're going to party out this place
And then move on
(Tough luck)
We'll kill you off and then make a clone
Yeah, we got spines and we have bones!
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Our soft feelings are getting hurt
Oh, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside these jeans
Well, we want just our water clean
This is how it's always been
And this is how it's going to be
So, you just move on
(Yow!)
The air's on fire so we're moving on
Better find another one 'cause this one's done
Waiting for the magic of the scientist's glove
To push, push, push, push, pull us up
Spend some time to floating out in space
Find another planet, make the same mistakes
Our minds all shatter when we climb on board
Hoping for the scientists to find another door
(Yeah)29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight

Looking kind of anxious in your cross-armed stance
Like a bad-tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
So I blame this town, this job, these friends
The truth is it's myself
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
When I finally get it figured out
I've changed the whole damn plan

Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight

Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight

Talking shit about a pretty sunset
Blanketing opinions that I'll probably regret soon
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Open up a window
All the air, oh, the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
We'll deal with the remainder
When the dents, the dents get hammered out
Then we'll travel through time

The world's an inventor
With its work crawling, running, squirming 'round
Trees drop colorful fruits
Directly into our mouths
The world's an inventor
We're the dirtiest thing it's thought about
And we really don't mind

We'll probably never get there
Bring your sight seers school teachers down
It's a watercolor weekend
All the trees are turning colors now
We'll probably never get there
Bring your candy taster, time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds
The world composes
With his shirttails wrinkled, hanging out
Bang us together
See what sort of sounds we make right now
The world plays music
Playing skin on teeth inside of the mouth
What sort of sounds?
What lovely sounds come about?

We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna pull things out
We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna travel time

We're gonna throw a party
All the ghosts of trees are coming out
Don't move in any direction
Wait until the light's inside of the cloud
You're gonna wanna see this
Don't bring your camera around
Watch sun and sawdust align
We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna pull things out
We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna travel time

Close up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
Our predecessor left this box
And something's clawing around
I think it really wants out17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
