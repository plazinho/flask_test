Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah, oh
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah


The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah (uhuhuh)
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah
In this town called Malice, uhuh-yeah
 
Some people might say my life is in a rut
I'm quite happy with what I got
People might say that I should strive for more
But I'm so happy I can't see the point

Something's happening here today
A show of strength with your boy's brigade
And I'm so happy and you're so kind
You want more money - of course, I don't mind
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes
And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got

I'm going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

Some people might get some pleasure out of hate
Me, I've enough already on my plate
People might need some tension to relax
Me, I'm too busy dodging between the flak

What you see is what you get
You made your bed, you better lie in it
You choose your leaders and place your trust
As their lies puts you down and their promises rust
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns
And the public wants what the public gets
But I don't get what this society wants

I'm going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
So let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

We talk and we talk until my head explodes
I turn on the news and my body froze
These braying sheep on my TV screen
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!

Going underground
I'm going underground

I'm going underground
I'm going underground
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

These braying sheep on my TV screen
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!

Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet go pound, pound, pound
Going underground (going underground)
So let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow
 
A police car and a screaming siren
Pneumatic drill and ripped-up concrete
A baby wailing, a stray dog howling
The screech of brakes and lamplight blinking
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
An electric train and a ripped-up phone booth
Paint-splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
Lights going out and a kick in the balls
I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
Days of speed and slow-time Mondays
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
Watching the news and not eating your tea
A freezing cold flat with damp on the walls
I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la
La la la la la
Waking up at 6 A.M. on a cool warm morning
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la
Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
Getting a cab and travelling on buses
Reading the grafitti about slashed-seat affairs
I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
 
The distant echo -
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps - repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrapers and this morning's papers
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow - they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change - and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows - gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
"Hey boy" they shout "have you got any money?"
And I said "I've a little money and a take away curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork"
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight
The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was "Jesus Saves" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read "Have an Awayday - a cheap holiday - Do it today!"
I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
Cause they took the keys - and she'll think it's me
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight
 
Sup up your beer and collect your fags
There's a row going on down near Slough
Get out your mat and pray to the West
I'll get out mine and pray for myself
Thought you were smart when you took them on
But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?
Hello-hurray, what a nice day
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I hope rain stops play
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse
Tore down the House of Commons in your brand new shoes
Composed a revolutionary symphony
Then went to bed with a charming young thing
Hello-hurray, cheers then, mate
It's the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, an extremist scrape
With the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a guilty schoolboy
What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a naughty schoolboy
We came out of it naturally the worst
Beaten and bloody, and I was sick down my shirt
We were no match for their untamed wit
Though some of the lads said they'd be back next week
Hello-hurray, it's the price to pay
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I'd prefer the plague
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, it's the price to pay
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I'd prefer the plague
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
 
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English rose
For no bonds can ever tempt me from she
I've sailed the seven seas
Flown the whole blue sky
But I've returned with haste to where my
Love does lie
No matter where I go I will come back to my English Rose
For nothing can ever tempt me from she
I've searched the secret mists -
I've climbed the highest peaks
Caught the wild wind home
To hear her soft voice speak
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English Rose
For no bonds can ever keep me from she
I've been to ancient worlds
I've scoured the whole universe
And caught the first train home
To be at her side
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English Rose
For no bonds, nothing and no-one can ever keep me from she
 
In the city there's a thousand things I want to say to you
But whenever I approach you
You make me look a fool
I wanna say
I wanna tell you
About the young ideas
But you turn them into fears
In the city there's a thousand faces all shining bright
And those golden faces are under 25
They wanna say
They gonna tell ya
About the young idea
You better listen now you've said your bit-a
And I know what you're thinking
You're sick of that kind of crap
But you'd better listen man
Because the kids know where it's at
In the city there's a thousand men in uniforms
And I've heard they now have the right to kill a man
We wanna say, we gonna tell ya
About the young idea
And if it don't work, at least we still tried
In the city, in the city
In the city
In the city
In the city there's a thousand things I want to say to you
 
It's not important for you to know my name
Nor I to know yours
If we communicate for two minutes only
It will be enough
For knowing that someone in this world
Feels as desperate as me
And what you give is what you get
It doesn't matter if we never meet again
What we have said will always remain
If we get through for two minutes only
It will be a start!
For knowing that someone in this life
Loves with a passion called hate
And what you give is what you get
If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you again
If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you again
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
 
In your white lace and your wedding bells
You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the on-looking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows
When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill
Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken dawn, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else
For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!
 
Life is timeless, days are long when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone
Any guitar and any bass drum
Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young
Life is new and there's things to be done
You can't wait to be grown up
Acceptance into the capital world
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young
But you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to comprehend
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end
But you don't mind you've got time on your side
And they're never gonna make you stand in line
You're just waiting for the right time
You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young
You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone
No corporations for the new age sons
Tears of rage roll down your face
But still you say "it's fun"
And you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to understand
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam
It's got you in its grip before you're born
It's done with the use of a dice and a board
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn
You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone
Any guitar and any bass drum
 
Beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
All the things that I care about
(Are packed into one punch)
All the things that I'm not sure about
(Are sorted out at once)
And as it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
That bullshit is bullshit
It just goes by different names
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
All the things that I shout about
(But never act upon)
All the courage and the dreams I have
(But seem to wait so long)
My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
And if you feel there's no passion
No quality sensation
Seize the young determination
Show the fakers you ain't foolin'
You'll see me come runnin'
To the sound of your strummin'
Fill my heart with joy and gladness
I've lived too long in the shadows of sadness
My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Wake me up with your amphetamine blast
Take me by the collar, throw me out into the world
Rock me gently and send me dreaming of something tender
I was brought here to pay homage
To the Beat Surrender
 
Found myself in a strange town
Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street
I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
But when you ask in a strange town
They say don't know, don't care
And I've got to go, mate
They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs
You've got to move in a straight line
You've got to walk and talk in four four time
You can't be weird in a strange town
You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners
You've got to wear the right clothes
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose
You can't be nice in a strange town
Cause we don't know, don't care
And we got to go, man
Rush my money to the record shops
I stop off in a back street
Buy myself a snort
We got our own manifesto
Be kind to queers
And I'm so glad the revolution's here
It's nice and warm now!
I've finished with clubs where the music's loud
Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd
There's no one there
I look in the mirror
But I can't be seen
Just a thin, clean layer of Mister Sheen
Looking back at me
Oh, oh
Found myself in a strange town
Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street
I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
They say don't know, don't care
And I've got to go, mate
They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs
Strange town
Break it up
Burn it down, shake it up
Break it up
