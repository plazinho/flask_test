How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today


I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)

Every time I think of you
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
But there's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
Well, every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself, that if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Won't you please let me go
These words lie inside, they hurt me so
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
Just what you want me to

I saw you this morning
I thought that you might like to know
I received your message in full a few days ago
I understood every word that it said
And now that I've actually heard it
You're going to regret

And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what you want me to
You're not the kind that needs to tell me
About the birds and the bees


Do you find this happens all the time
Crucial point one day becomes a crime
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you

This is why events unnerve me
They find it all, a different story
Notice whom for wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she ask's the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
Word will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and lean towards this time

Oh, I'll break them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time

Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning Sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We want goals
A beauty scored by Bobby Charlton
We want goals

You've got to hold and give but do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast but you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you, defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them, get round the back
Catch me if you can, cause I'm the England man
And what you're looking at is the master plan
We ain't no hooligans, this ain't a football song
Three lions on my chest, I know we can't go wrong
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one

A heaven, a gateway, a hope
Just like a feeling I need, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to treat you this way
Betrayed by words I'd never heard, too hard to say

Oh, up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Each way I turn, I know I'll always try
To break this circle that has been placed around me
From time to time, I find I've lost some need
That was so urgent to myself, I do believe

Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got grey eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got grey eyes
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
On a thousand islands in the sea
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
I watch them walking, falling in a row
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
There's a thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame

And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou

From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
To my teeth, through my nose
You get these words wrong
You get these words wrong
Every time
You get these words wrong
I just smile
But from my head to my toes
From my knees to my eyes
Every time I watch the sky
For these last few days leave me alone
But for these last few days leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Maybe I've forgotten the name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known, it's nothing I regret
Save it for another day, it's the school exam
The kids have run away

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was upset, you see, almost all the time
You used to be a stranger, now you are mine

I wouldn't even trust you, I've not got much to give
We're dealing in the limits and we don't know who with
You may think that I'm out of hand, that I'm naive, I'll understand
On this occasion it's not true
Look at me, I'm not you

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was a short fuse burning all the time
You were a complete stranger, now you are mine
I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain about my wounded heart

Just wait 'til tomorrow
I guess that's what they all say
Just before they fall apart3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh I've just come
From the land of the sun
From a war that must be won
In the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave
Your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades
And some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe
The joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave
And I was going home
Oh I flew through the sky
My convictions could not lie
For my country I would die
And I will see it soon
I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door
My wife she lay upon the floor
And with tears her eyes were sore
I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand
And I saw the telegram
That said that I was a brave, brave man
But that I was dead

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
A thought that never changes remains a stupid lie
It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no colors, just silence
Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care
Sound formed in a vacuum may seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no lyrics, just nothing
The sign that leads the way
The path we can not take
You've caught me at a bad time
So, why don't you piss off?7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I stood there beside myself
Thinking hard about the weather
Then came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start:
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his gun
I said "let's go out and have some fun"

I know, you know, you believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

I have always thought about
Staying here and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun
I said "let's go out and have some fun"

I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
When you are alone at night
You search yourself for all the things
That you believe are right
If you give it all away
You throw away your only chance to be here today
Then a fight breaks out on your street
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat
My friend, he took his final breath
Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death

My promise could be your fiend
A given end to your dreams
A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
In its escapable view
There's no escape, so few in fear
Give in a changing value

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
Hello, farewell to your love and soul
Hello, farewell to your soul

Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste and see
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What can you buy
That lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
What makes your day?
What miracle of life
Has come to stay?
A taste of love
So sweet, so real you can't let go
And how does it feel?
It feels so good...

But how much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?
How much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?

I want a nice car
A girlfriend
Who's as pretty as a star
I want respect
As much, as much as I can get

But how much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?
How much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?
Restless
I feel so restless
And in this changing world
I am lost for words
I feel so restless
Ain't got no interest
I couldn't care less
Can't be a success

Due to current studies
The fiscal climate isn't looking good
Get out of town
The streets are running rivers full of blood
The more I see
The less, the less that I believe
The more I hear
The less, the less that I perceive

Restless
I feel so restless
And in this changing world
I am lost for words
I feel so restless
Ain't got no interest
I couldn't care less
Can't be a success

What can you buy
That lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
What makes your day?
What miracle of life
Has come to stay?
A taste of love
So sweet, so real you can't let go
And how does it feel?
It feels so good...

Restless
I am so restless
And this changing world
Leaves me speechless
I am lost for words
But I kept my nerve
But it's not hopeless
If you take less3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We're like crystal, we break easy
I'm a poor man, if you leave me
I'm applauded, then forgotten
It was summer, now it's autumn

I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core

We're like crystal, it's not easy
With your love, you could feed me
Every man, and every woman
Needs someone, So keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming

I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
