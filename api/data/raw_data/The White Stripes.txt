I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says "Leave it alone"


Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says "Find a home"



I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me "Go back home"
 
Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
I can tell that we are going to be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

And we don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends
 
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"
I said, "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"
"Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating, now"

Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor, and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Well, I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you


Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

I had opinions that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button


The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
 
Ah, icky thump, who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well, what a chump
Well, my head got a bump when I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita looking dead
Came and said, "Need a bed?" in Español
I said, "Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar, and I don't need a microphone"

Icky thump with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there
On the stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

White Americans, what? Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's using who? What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too
Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around, and there was nobody else
Left alone, I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself
 
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
And right now, you could care less about me
But soon enough, you will care by the time I'm done

Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball, girl
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everybody in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it


Now read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
Read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
That my strength is ten fold girl
I'll let you see it if you want to before you go

Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everybody in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it
And I can think of one or two things to say about it
Alright, listen

Alright, you get the point now?

It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It was the other two which made me your third
But it's my mother who made me the seventh son
And right now, you could care less about me
But soon enough, you will care by the time I'm done

Yeah, you just wait
You stick around
You'll figure it out
 
Dead leaves and the dirty ground
When I know you're not around
Shiny tops and soda pops
When I hear your lips make a sound
When I hear your lips make a sound
Thirty notes in the mailbox
Will tell you that I'm coming home
And I think I'm gonna stick around
For a while so you're not alone
For a while so you're not alone

If you can hear a piano fall
You can hear me coming down the hall
If I could just hear your pretty voice
I don't think I'd need to see at all
Don't think I'd need to see at all
Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
And every breath that is in your lungs
Is a tiny little gift to me
Is a tiny little gift to me

I didn't feel so bad 'til the sun went down
Then I come home
No one to wrap my arms around
Wrap my arms around

Well, any man with a microphone
Can tell you what he loves the most
And you know why you love at all
If you're thinking of the holy ghost
If you're thinking of the holy ghost
 
You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing, it's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

You're given a flower
But I guess that there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think that it's just me teasing you

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue
 
When problems overwhelm us and sadness smothers us, where do we find the will and the courage to continue?  Well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend, a chance encounter with a book, or from a personal faith.  For Janet, help came from her faith, but it also came from a squirrel.  Shortly after her divorce, Janet lost her father then she lost her job, she had mounting money problems.  But Janet not only survived, she worked her way out of despondency and now she says, life is good again.  How could this happen?  She told me that late one autumn day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter, one at a time he would take them to the nest.  And she thought, if that squirrel can take care of himself with a harsh winter coming on, so can I.  Once I broke my problems into small pieces, I was able to carry them, just like those acorns, one at a time

Take all your problems and rip 'em apart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Carry them off in a shopping cart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Another thing you should've known from the start
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The problems in hand are lighter than at heart
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Be like the squirrel, girl, be like the squirrel
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Give it a whirl, girl, be like the squirrel
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
And another thing you have to know in this world
Oh, oh, ah-oh-oh
Cut up your hair, straighten your curls
Well, your problems hide in your curls

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
 
I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me to move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said 39 times that I love you
To the beauty I had found

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

I been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take 'til we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gotta worry about locking the door

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

It might sound silly
For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say 'I do' at least

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
And it's 4, 5, 6, 7
Grab your umbrella
Grab hold of me
'Cause I'm your favorite fella
All they got inside is vacancy
