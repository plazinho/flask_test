Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
 
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, "You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too"
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
 
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

You know I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh
 
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
 
I've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song

So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh

I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end

And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me

Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
 
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warning (I had no warning)
About who you are (About who you are)
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)
It just made you mad
And I had no warning (I had no warning)
About who you are (About who you are)
'Bout who you are

Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah

'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be
 
Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper ‘bout you on the train like me?
Saying that "you shouldn't waste your pretty face" like me?

And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self-esteem, so you run on gasoline"

(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
I think there’s a flaw in my code
(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

Are you deranged like me? Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me?

And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self-esteem, so you run on gasoline"

(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
I think there’s a flaw in my code
(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold
 
If I
If I

Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor

See, everywhere I go, I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
Yeah

(I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
(I know you wanna slip under my armor)
Oh (I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
 
Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
Just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father
But he could never love somebody’s daughter
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar

Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We know very well who we are
So we hold it down when summer starts
What kind of dough have you been spending?
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana
 
It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard (No, oh)

You look at me (Look at me)
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me (Push right through me)
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal

Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
 
Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I said

Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this
I said

Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally
 
I don't wanna fight right now

They sent me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake, with shadows and monsters
The hallways, they echoed and groaned
I sat alone, in bed till the morning
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease

I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

I paced around for hours on empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around

I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead

I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
 
She doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore
'Cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get
She doesn't look me in the eyes anymore
Too scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me

When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me

Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

She doesn't call me on the phone anymore
She's never listening, she says it's innocent
She doesn't let me have control anymore
I must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind

When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me

Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

I miss the mornings with you laying in my bed
I miss the memories replaying in my head
I miss the thought of a forever, you and me
But all you're missing is my body, oh

Said we're not lovers (we're not lovers)
'Cause we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all (anything)

To feel anything at all
To feel anything at all
(You lost it)
(You lost it)
(You lost it)
 
I, I know where to lay
I know what to say
It's all the same
And I, I know how to play
I know this game
It's all the same

Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
So tell me where I went wrong
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)
Would've traded all for you, there for you
So tell me how to move on
Would've traded all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)

Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

He don't realize that I'm thinkin' about you
It's nothing new, it's nothing new

Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new
 
Sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise
Tired of all these cameras flashing, sick of being poised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it

Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei

I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

Oh, all these minutes passing, sick of feeling used
If you wanna break these walls down, you’re gonna get bruised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it

Crying about it (Agnus dei)
Crying about it (Agnus dei)
Crying about it, about it, bout it, bout it (Agnus dei, Agnus dei)

I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it

I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle
 
My demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about

I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

Selfish
Taking what I want, and call it mine
I’m helpless
Clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me
Telling me I’m running out of time
They shush me (Shh)
Walking me across a fragile line

I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

Hold me down now
Hold me down now
Hold me do-o-o-o-own

I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
 
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye

You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him

You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

I'm searching for something that I can't reach

My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
 
I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
In my world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough (Hmm)
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?

'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some

Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?

'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some

My face is full of spiderwebs, all tender, yellow, blue
And still with one eye open, well, all I see is you
I left my daydreams at the gate because I just can't take 'em too
Know my heart still has a suitcase, but I still can't take it through

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone (I don't need anyone)
I don't need anyone (I don't need anyone)
I just need everyone and then some (I just need everyone and then some)

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Oh-mmm, oh-mmm (Yep)
 
There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss

And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where ya tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me

And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

He says, "Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me"

I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricane
