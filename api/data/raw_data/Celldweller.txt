(Get ready)
(Get ready, get set)
(Get ready, get set, let's roll)

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

S. O. B
You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90
Huh huh, goosebumps when the cops behind me, yo
The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs
Enjoy your doughnuts, Sir, you ain't gonna find me
It's not likely their brains is blown out
You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down
Hundred proof octane, ready to drink, bitch
Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip
Time's up, the animals crept through
Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws
Skin and bones let mess with your chrome set
Tricked out, hopping like your cruise in a cold chest
Park that eagle with a safety pin
Take the backseat, now let the games begin, yeah
Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)

Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
The big boss spray-painted on my mud flap
Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff
Can never get enough
Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
You're playing with the sharks, step inside
Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride
That's right, put the pedal to the metal and go
The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
So quick, get in the palm trees, look out, whoa
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button, that'll smoke any whip you own
I told you I don't want to close your casket
Quit now before you go blowing a gasket
Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)

(Go, go, go)
Melting, meltdown!
While time is shifting
Transist, transform! (out purposely)
Yielding, bending
While time is shifting
Two shapes that can't get straight
(Get ready, get set, let's roll)

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
If you want it, come and let me know
I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and (go!)
(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Traces of cyanide in your cigarette
Gun full of bullets for your russian roulette
(We all feel sorry for you now)
Your luck is flying like a bat out of hell
You're empty-handed at your life's show-and-tell
(You have no idea what's coming down)

(A million voices call from the other side)
(If you could hear them you would be terrified!)

Good luck, you're fucked!
And we hate to see you go, man
But everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
It's like a losing game of hangman
The letter we need is U
U, U, U
Good luck!

Piss in your coffee and there's nails in your bread
Snakes in your toilet and a shark in your bed
(We all feel sorry for you now)
The grim reaper's grading your show-and-tell
That bat is taking your life back into hell
(You have no idea what's coming down)
(A million voices call from the other side)
(If you could hear them you would be terrified!)

Good luck, you're fucked
And we hate to see you go, man
But everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
And your life's about to blow, man
And everyone knows but you
You, you, you
Good luck!

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open (mmm)
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall (mmm)
A fading memory (when my mind is frozen)
(Right!)
(Let's go)
(Let's go)

I can see a frozen point in time where her figure still awaits
Tongue of fire tracing lips outline where frozen breath originates (right!)
With one motion of her wanting eyes she strips everything away
This one moment is intensified and the colors all fade to grey

(Ooh-ooh) I am in the only place that I want to be
(Ooh-ooh) Though we know that it ends eventually
(Ooh-ooh) But it's alright 'cause right now we're frozen
(I want to forget mistakes they've helped me make)
("It's better to be broken than to break")
(Right!)

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
(Mmm, let's go)
(Mmm, let's go)
I can see a frozen point in time that is easy to retrace
Light and darkness are both intertwined, the elements are in their place
(Ooh-ooh) With one motion of her wanting mind the real world begins to fade
And all the hateful things I have become temporarily go away (right!)

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
Frozen
(Right!)

When my mind's frozen
Take me anywhere you want to go
We're far from anything that feels like home, let's go
Here I'm anyone I want to be
It's here and now, and now it's only you and me
It's never enough, mmm, that's true
I want to stay here, yeah, and I do, too
Breakin' it down, takin' it down
With smell, touch and taste, sight and sound

How long will I be here without you near?
Because I'm so cold
"Break them first or I'll get broken" is not what I was told
Now I'm so cold, I'm so cold
So cold
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open

How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb
I wanted to believe someone I shouldn't have

Made the mistake of opening my mouth
I thought you'd understand but I guess that thinking doesn't count
Act all concerned — Well, sucks for me, man!
Can't wait to see where you'll be when it finally hits the fan

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
Whoa!

Oh, give it up and get out of my way
Don't bother patronizing me just 'cause you've got nothing to say
I've taken what you've told me, I was ready to apply
"Liars can't be trusted", man, but you're the one who lied!

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
One time my spine
Controlled by your small mind
So many reasons
For what you've justified (don't kill yourself)
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
You can't give me

You can't give me

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire

A start, an end, a rise and fall
No system eternal and no one immortal
Creation, all must end in destruction
We cannot change the fate of civilization

(Start... end) We build our symbols of power
(Rise... fall) Constructs of a mortal mind
(Life...span) Conquer in our brightest hour
(Mor...tal) But then we all must fall in time

Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm
At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire

(Time... love) Kingdoms, each of us reigning
(Dreams... death) Over the realms of our hearts and minds
(Space... mind) Conscious that death is awaiting
(Scene... tech) But even death will end in time

Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire
In the death of a desire
It's the end of an empire
At the close of a lifetime
It's the end of an empire

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire
Again
It's the end of an empire

We're falling into the unknown
Another ending that's beginning to unfold
We're falling into the unknown (it's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold (it's the end of an empire)
We're falling into the unknown (it's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold (it's the end)
We're falling into the unknown (it's the end)

Now, as you know, it's your time on this Earth
While we're rocking the cradle we're riding the hearse
We keep moving upward towards everything free
And kindly look downward and oh, you'll see me
I've had six years of luck, I've had six on the line
I've poured myself out like an old bitter wine
I've seen much of nothin' and nothin's the game
I've been thrown on my back and I don't know my name

There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain

Points on the map, tears line the way
I've seen all your pretty things and oh, it's a shame
There's been much confusion with too many hurt
I feel my words dyin' down in the dirt
I've had lies in my head, there's been lies in my heart
I've been tortured by this riddle and I don't know how to start
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys, and my mind, it starts to click
So do what you must do and you best do it quick
There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's too many tears, too many tears

Doctor, oh doctor, my world's in your hands
I feel like I'm dyin' and oh, I need a plan
Sister, sweet sister, there's blood on my lips
Why does it feel like this wound's doing flips?
The dream's come on time, it's clear, I can tell
I've seen your work everywhere and there's mercy in hell
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys, and again it all comes down
And I see my life merging with these poor souls underground

There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever, whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain 
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's too many tears, too many tears
(There's too many tears, too many tears)
And fall like rain
(There's too many tears, too many tears)

Oh, man, I can't believe that you did what they said you did
And to this day I've still gotta say that in my mind I question it
I wish I knew what you had meant before you went
And left me wondering to just an echo of your voice
(Listen)
(Listen)
(Listen)
(Listen)

Now I wait to take my turn to bleed like a kid playing with a razor blade
And wonder if I have the balls at all or if I'm gonna be afraid
Where are you? What do you think? 'Cause I'm not sure when knocking at Death's door
If I will be welcomed in or be left alone outside

(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)
(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)

I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark (Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down (Firstborn, last one)
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline (Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me (Firstborn, last one)
I guess there comes a point when you think to yourself
"This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"
And now I feel what you felt, and now I feel what you felt inside, brother
And now I feel what you felt: "This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"

For a crime, lifetime, imagination locked in a cell

My own little world

Mutual sight, mutual sound
Mutual struggle for shared ground
(It's safe to say, they'll try to take from me)
I'm just another one for them to break down

Steeped in denial, oh the daily grind
Dream of a world for me and my kind
(It's safe in the alternate reality)
So stick your standards where the sun doesn't shine

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
Promise the world then take it from you anyway
They'll break you down, making your vision fade away
It's time to go! (Get outta my space!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here, I will never die

Explain the reasons, explain the rhymes
It's not required, inside our minds

Or take their guilt trip at the end of the line

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
Promise the world then take the universe away
They'll break you down, making your vision fade away
It's time to go! (Get off of my case!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here
Slip into a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Come with me into it and you know what you will find
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die

It's always the same
Tears for a time we can never regain
As life drifts away
We search for the reasons we can't make it stay
We walk in a shadowland
Turning to dust, blown away in the wind
One last soul to save
That hangs from a thread off the end of a dream

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side

It's always the same
Mourn for a life we can never reclaim
As time drifts away
We search for the reasons we can't make it stay
Alone in a shadowland
Turning to dust, blown away like the sand
One last soul to save
That hangs off a dream at the end of a thread

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side
We'll jump the great divide
And you'll greet us on the other side
On the other side
On the other side

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side
We'll jump the great divide
And you'll greet us on the other side

I fought a monster a mile high
Arm wrestled twenty octopi (for you, for... you)
I had a sword fight with a samurai
And sang the sirens a lullaby (for you, for... you)

I’ve pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you

Well I’m not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you

I’ve already crossed my heart and hoped to die

I will take you everywhere I fly

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

You build 'em up
You layer stone on stone
You build 'em high
To keep out your enemies
The sky grows dark
The earth is trembling
An unhappy ending
To your final fantasy

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho
We'll all enjoy the show
When your walls fall like Jericho

You're looking down
And feeling so profound
You're so impressed
By your own false humility
The sky descends
The ground is rising up
An unhappy ending
To your sense of deity

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)
You sit alone
Up on your lonely throne
You're so oblivious
To your own frailty
The sky erupts
The ground has opened wide
An unhappy ending
To the life you've glorified
To the life you've glorified

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
We'll all enjoy the show
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)
When your walls fall like Jericho
(This is over, this is over)
We'll all enjoy the show
It's do-do-down you go
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho
(This is over, this is over)

I'm not clear how it is that I ended up here
(Then let me help you clear your clouded memory) (It's easy!)
(Because nobody in the world could know you better than me)
Déjà vu, think of you, now so far, once so near
(Don't get all sentimental, using up your prime) (Showtime!)
(This pile of shit you're shovelin' is gettin' hard to climb)
Tangled in my own reflection, on the way down, fadeaway

With my hands on my mind, I hold wounds that won't mend
(Well, just stop tryin' to be something that you're not) (Maggot!)
(You'll never shake me, never break me and never overtake me)
With my eyes open wide, I can see it's the end
Tangled in my imperfections, on the way down, fadeaway

Don't hate me now
They've torn away the ground from under me
Right after they were reassured that I believed
Normality is not a word I understand at all
I set myself up for the fall (Fadeaway)
Withdrawing deep into the hole (Fadeaway)
This isolated little cell leaves me cold and faded

(Fadeaway, fadeaway, fadeaway)
(Fadeaway, fadeaway, fadeaway)
I'm my one and only friend
I am my worst enemy
I find new methods to pretend
That this is not reality
(Don't be lonely)
(Now I'm your only)
Just stay far away from me
When I fade away from me (Just stay far away from me)
Just stay far away from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fade away from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fade away from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fade away from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fade away from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fade away from me
When I'm not what I used to be
Yeah, when I fade away from me
When I'm between myself and me
When I fade away from me

When I'm lost in time (I'm lost in time)
I'm lost in time  (I'm lost in time)

The criminal and crime
He is stealing and concealing
I'm not crying
But I'm dying
And I can't help but feel I'm running out of time

A problem I'm not solving
Eternally revolving
I've wandered from the pathway
Praying you will come to save me

I (I) feel lost in time (I)
But if I wait for direction my lifetime will pass me by
I (I) feel lost in time (I)
I think if I live for forever this feeling will never die

The criminal and crime
He's not healing nor revealing
I can't deny
I question why
And I can't help but feel that I'll be lost in time
A problem I'm not solving
Eternally revolving
I've wandered from the pathway
Praying you will come to save me

I (I) feel lost in time (I)
But if I wait for direction my lifetime will pass me by
I (I) feel lost in time (I)
I think if I live for forever this feeling will never die
(Lost in time)
(I'm lost in time)
(I'm lost in time)
(I'm lost in)

I am a criminal without a crime
I am a genius without a mind
Always a reason but there's never a rhyme
How can patience be my virtue when I'm out of time?
(I'm out of time)
I am a criminal without a crime
I am a genius without a mind
Always a reason but there's never a rhyme
How could I know where I'm going when I'm lost in time?
I wandered from the pathway
Praying you will come to save me
(Please come to save me!)

I (I) feel lost in time (I)
But if I wait for direction my lifetime will pass me by
I (I) feel lost in time (I)
I think if I live for forever this feeling will never die
(Please come to save me!)
(I'm lost in time)
This feeling will never die
(I'm lost in time)
This feeling will never die
(I'm lost in time)
Never ever die
(Please come to save me!)
(I'm lost in time)

(Disintegrate)
(You’re my disintegrati-)-on!
(You're my disintegration)
(You're my disintegration)

My salvation or my damnation?
Disintegration of everything I am
(Disintegrate)
(Disintegrate)

Rotate, I separate from the comfort of reality
Fixation feeding intoxication, locks me to your gravity

Stimulate! Resonate! Activate!
(You’re my disintegration)

My salvation or my damnation?
Disintegration of everything I am

Seduction in your atmosphere
Siren sings a song divine
Although I know the more that I draw near, I fear
The more you steal my life – my disintegration
(Disintegrate)
(Disintegrate)
Revolving, resistance dissolving, ignore certain casualty
Affliction, my eternal addiction, ignorance bleeds blissfully

Stimulate! Resonate! Activate!
(You’re my disintegration)

My damnation or my salvation?
Disintegration of everything I am

Seduction in your atmosphere
Siren sings a song divine
Although I know the more that I draw near, I fear
The more you steal my life – my disintegration
(Disintegrate)

Out here alone, lost in your glow
Your gravity is pulling me, leads me on to my new home
Endlessly circling, I near your flame
Blissfully unaware the voice I hear that beckons me ensures nothing will remain
Bathed in your heat, absorbed in your light
I regret I didn’t know I was incapable of perceiving my own plight
Activate, captivate, annihilate
(You’re my disint-grati-)-on!
(You're my disintegration)
Seduction in your atmosphere
Siren sings a song divine
Although I know the more that I draw near, I fear
The more you steal my life – my disintegration

(Now I'm pushing, I'm pushing)
(I'm pushing through)
(I'm pushing through face)
I'm pushing through facedown!
I'm pushing through facedown!

I'm pacing inside this empty room
Told to wait til my life's withdrawn
Uneasy, I'm waiting here anxiously
It's a waste and I won't wait another eon

Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
I'm pushing through
Facedown and pushing through

Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I can't feel anything
Erasing my final memories
They won't stop til my whole life's gone
Uneasy, I wait for normality
It's a waste and I won't wait another eon

Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through
I'm pushing through
Facedown and pushing through

Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I can't feel anything

When life is gone without a trace
And hope is lost in time's embrace
I won't wait or hesitate
Cause I'm pushing through facedown!
I won't wait or hesitate
Cause I'm pushing through
If time's a song, I won't wait for its reprise
I am done wishing farewells and goodbyes
I won't let this place overshadow my
Birthright, I won't wait another eon

(Impatiently)
Impatiently-y-y-y
I'm cutting through the earth in front of me
Bone on stone, blood and sweat married
Can't hear the voice that whispers fears when my heart is pounding in my ears
All I see in my mind(-i-i-ind) is not what I've left behind
But all the things I've been missing in that lost eon

Endless night
Long for light
My head against this tomb
And pushing through

Trapped and isolated
Time is dislocated
Eternity is what a moment seems
When I am lost inside this dream
When I can't speak and I can't scream
And I can't feel anything
Facedown and pushing through1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Spin into the) Void!
Void

(Gravity destroyed)
(Spin into the void)
A life undone
As you fade out from the Sun
Humane or inhuman?
Alone now with the person that you have become

It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong or right
It doesn’t matter what they say
It only matters who you satellite
Everything else permanently stripped away

Who are you? Malignant or benign?
Would you sell out your brother to save your own life?
Or neglect your own safety to save him from his plight?
Who will you be when your life starts to spin into the void?

(Gravity destroyed)
(Spin into the void)
(Spin into the) Void!
Destroy, create, life, death, love, hate
Manipulate
Regenerate (water, fire, truth or liar)
Who are you? Malignant or benign?
Would you sell out your brother to save your own life?
Or neglect your own safety to save him from his plight?
Who will you be when your life starts to spin into the void?

Shaken out of its orbit and forced from its flight
In the heart of the darkness, sole satellite
Suddenly the pull of gravity destroyed
As you spin into the void!
Heading into the fall, for once and for all
And face to face with exactly who you are at the core
No rescue, no one to save you
This time

Destroy, create
Life, death, love, hate
A guiding light or manipulate
Subversive force or regenerate (water, fire, truth or liar)

Who are you? Malignant or benign?
Would you sell out your brother to save your own life?
Or neglect your own safety to save him from his plight?
Who will you be when your life starts to spin into the void?

(I should have seen the signs)
(It was only just a matter of time)
(I should have seen the signs)
(It was only just a matter of time)

Standing in ruins blinded by another meteor
I never even saw it coming down just like all the ones before
The irony of the conveniency of things made up in your head
Inflate, fixate while you suffocate every promise that you've ever made

The saddest tale
I’ll never tell
Will echo through
The halls of Hell

An eon lost
The countless cost
Need your next victim to malign
It was only just a matter of time

I've watched you do unto others
As you've imagined they’ve done to you
And your pride has come before the fall and your downfall is believing all
Your fantasies are true
I should have heard the warnings
I should have seen the signs
As you did unto them you'd do to me, your true nature would show eventually
It was just a matter of time, a matter of time
The ring of empty words, a string of dead intentions
Moments strewn across a timeline, you've deleted every one
I watched you over years make a career of making enemies
I was so dumb to think you wouldn't be the one to turn your weapon against me

The saddest tale
I'll never tell
Will echo through
The halls of Hell

An eon lost
The countless cost
Need your next victim to malign
It was only just a matter of time

I've watched you do unto others
As you've imagined they've done to you
And your pride has come before the fall and your downfall is believing all
Your fantasies are true
I should have heard the warnings
I should have seen the signs
As you did unto them you’d do to me, your true nature would show eventually
It was just a matter of time, a matter of time!

It was just a matter of time
An eon lost

It was only just a matter of time
(It was only just a matter of time)
(It was only just a matter of time)

This is my last goodbye, my epitaph for you
False pretense of integrity, you believed your lies were true
And this could be the saddest tale I’ll never tell
Evanescently will echo through the halls of Hell
(It was only just a matter of time)

I've watched you do unto others
As you’ve imagined they've done to you
And your pride has come before the fall and your downfall is believing all
Your fantasies are true

As you did unto them you'd do to me, your true nature would show eventually
It was just a matter of time, a matter of time!

I've been here many times before
Standing here with broken hands knocking on this broken door
I can't decide which way to go
And this is just another time I prove to you

How little I must know
How little I must know

Here I am back at the start
Standing here with empty words flowing from an empty heart
I'm letting down and letting go
And just like every other time I prove to you

How little I must know
How little I must know
How little I must know (I'm letting down and letting go)
How little I must know (Just like every other time I prove to you)

Sick of this mind and the games it plays
Mental enemy-enemy-enemies want to push me back again
Here they come, running, wanting me up on that tree, crucified (wait a minute!)
Whatever words they say (me who said it!)
Whomever they betray (me who did it!)
Whenever they're awake it makes me die

So much on my mind, we're given so little time
There's no way to hold on as it passes by
So lead me into denial, help me forget for a while
(Stay with me, please don't go)

Stay with me, please don't go (Stay here, please)
If you want to be alone (Stay here, please)
Stay with me, please (Stay here, please)
