(Get ready)
(Get ready, get set)
(Get ready, get set, let's roll)

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

S. O. B
You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90
Huh huh, goosebumps when the cops behind me, yo
The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs
Enjoy your doughnuts, Sir, you ain't gonna find me
It's not likely their brains is blown out
You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down
Hundred proof octane, ready to drink, bitch
Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip
Time's up, the animals crept through
Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws
Skin and bones let mess with your chrome set
Tricked out, hopping like your cruise in a cold chest
Park that eagle with a safety pin
Take the backseat, now let the games begin, yeah
Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)

Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
The big boss spray-painted on my mud flap
Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff
Can never get enough
Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
You're playing with the sharks, step inside
Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride
That's right, put the pedal to the metal and go
The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
So quick, get in the palm trees, look out, whoa
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button, that'll smoke any whip you own
I told you I don't want to close your casket
Quit now before you go blowing a gasket
Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)

(Go, go, go)
Melting, meltdown!
While time is shifting
Transist, transform! (out purposely)
Yielding, bending
While time is shifting
Two shapes that can't get straight
(Get ready, get set, let's roll)

(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
If you want it, come and let me know
I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and (go!)
(Shapeshifter!)
Come on, man, you can't be real
Imma show you what it is, let the anthem build
(Shapeshifter!)
Put the pedal to the metal and (go!)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Traces of cyanide in your cigarette
Gun full of bullets for your russian roulette
(We all feel sorry for you now)
Your luck is flying like a bat out of hell
You're empty-handed at your life's show-and-tell
(You have no idea what's coming down)

(A million voices call from the other side)
(If you could hear them you would be terrified!)

Good luck, you're fucked!
And we hate to see you go, man
But everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
It's like a losing game of hangman
The letter we need is U
U, U, U
Good luck!

Piss in your coffee and there's nails in your bread
Snakes in your toilet and a shark in your bed
(We all feel sorry for you now)
The grim reaper's grading your show-and-tell
That bat is taking your life back into hell
(You have no idea what's coming down)
(A million voices call from the other side)
(If you could hear them you would be terrified!)

Good luck, you're fucked
And we hate to see you go, man
But everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
And your life's about to blow, man
And everyone knows but you
You, you, you
Good luck!

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open (mmm)
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall (mmm)
A fading memory (when my mind is frozen)
(Right!)
(Let's go)
(Let's go)

I can see a frozen point in time where her figure still awaits
Tongue of fire tracing lips outline where frozen breath originates (right!)
With one motion of her wanting eyes she strips everything away
This one moment is intensified and the colors all fade to grey

(Ooh-ooh) I am in the only place that I want to be
(Ooh-ooh) Though we know that it ends eventually
(Ooh-ooh) But it's alright 'cause right now we're frozen
(I want to forget mistakes they've helped me make)
("It's better to be broken than to break")
(Right!)

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
(Mmm, let's go)
(Mmm, let's go)
I can see a frozen point in time that is easy to retrace
Light and darkness are both intertwined, the elements are in their place
(Ooh-ooh) With one motion of her wanting mind the real world begins to fade
And all the hateful things I have become temporarily go away (right!)

Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
Frozen
(Right!)

When my mind's frozen
Take me anywhere you want to go
We're far from anything that feels like home, let's go
Here I'm anyone I want to be
It's here and now, and now it's only you and me
It's never enough, mmm, that's true
I want to stay here, yeah, and I do, too
Breakin' it down, takin' it down
With smell, touch and taste, sight and sound

How long will I be here without you near?
Because I'm so cold
"Break them first or I'll get broken" is not what I was told
Now I'm so cold, I'm so cold
So cold
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open
True life behind the wall where men and angels fall
A fading memory when my mind is frozen
Inside this fantasy it seems so real to me
Synthetic ecstasy when her legs are open

How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb
I wanted to believe someone I shouldn't have

Made the mistake of opening my mouth
I thought you'd understand but I guess that thinking doesn't count
Act all concerned — Well, sucks for me, man!
Can't wait to see where you'll be when it finally hits the fan

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
Whoa!

Oh, give it up and get out of my way
Don't bother patronizing me just 'cause you've got nothing to say
I've taken what you've told me, I was ready to apply
"Liars can't be trusted", man, but you're the one who lied!

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
One time my spine
Controlled by your small mind
So many reasons
For what you've justified (don't kill yourself)
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
You can't give me

You can't give me

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire

A start, an end, a rise and fall
No system eternal and no one immortal
Creation, all must end in destruction
We cannot change the fate of civilization

(Start... end) We build our symbols of power
(Rise... fall) Constructs of a mortal mind
(Life...span) Conquer in our brightest hour
(Mor...tal) But then we all must fall in time

Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm
At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire

(Time... love) Kingdoms, each of us reigning
(Dreams... death) Over the realms of our hearts and minds
(Space... mind) Conscious that death is awaiting
(Scene... tech) But even death will end in time

Through space and time
We can't escape this paradigm

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire
In the death of a desire
It's the end of an empire
At the close of a lifetime
It's the end of an empire

At the edge of the hellfire
It's the end of an empire
In the line of the gunfire
It's the end of an empire
Again
Again
Again
Again
It's the end of an empire
Again
It's the end of an empire

We're falling into the unknown
Another ending that's beginning to unfold
We're falling into the unknown (it's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold (it's the end of an empire)
We're falling into the unknown (it's the end)
Another ending that's beginning to unfold (it's the end)
We're falling into the unknown (it's the end)

Now, as you know, it's your time on this Earth
While we're rocking the cradle we're riding the hearse
We keep moving upward towards everything free
And kindly look downward and oh, you'll see me
I've had six years of luck, I've had six on the line
I've poured myself out like an old bitter wine
I've seen much of nothin' and nothin's the game
I've been thrown on my back and I don't know my name

There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain

Points on the map, tears line the way
I've seen all your pretty things and oh, it's a shame
There's been much confusion with too many hurt
I feel my words dyin' down in the dirt
I've had lies in my head, there's been lies in my heart
I've been tortured by this riddle and I don't know how to start
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys, and my mind, it starts to click
So do what you must do and you best do it quick
There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's too many tears, too many tears

Doctor, oh doctor, my world's in your hands
I feel like I'm dyin' and oh, I need a plan
Sister, sweet sister, there's blood on my lips
Why does it feel like this wound's doing flips?
The dream's come on time, it's clear, I can tell
I've seen your work everywhere and there's mercy in hell
With a lightning flash and thunder, boys, and again it all comes down
And I see my life merging with these poor souls underground

There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever, whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's too many tears, too many tears
Too many people in too many years
Some tears of laughter and some tears of pain
That break like a fever and fall like rain 
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's too many tears, too many tears
(There's too many tears, too many tears)
And fall like rain
(There's too many tears, too many tears)

Oh, man, I can't believe that you did what they said you did
And to this day I've still gotta say that in my mind I question it
I wish I knew what you had meant before you went
And left me wondering to just an echo of your voice
(Listen)
(Listen)
(Listen)
(Listen)

Now I wait to take my turn to bleed like a kid playing with a razor blade
And wonder if I have the balls at all or if I'm gonna be afraid
Where are you? What do you think? 'Cause I'm not sure when knocking at Death's door
If I will be welcomed in or be left alone outside

(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)
(Oh, oh, boy, I love you)
(Lying here still)

I hear the sound of a heart from the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark (Listen, my son)
I see the darkness surround the shape on the ground
The killer straight up and a body face down (Firstborn, last one)
I hear the din of the screams, sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline (Listen, my son)
I see a heart set free and my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me (Firstborn, last one)
I guess there comes a point when you think to yourself
"This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"
And now I feel what you felt, and now I feel what you felt inside, brother
And now I feel what you felt: "This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"

For a crime, lifetime, imagination locked in a cell

My own little world

Mutual sight, mutual sound
Mutual struggle for shared ground
(It's safe to say, they'll try to take from me)
I'm just another one for them to break down

Steeped in denial, oh the daily grind
Dream of a world for me and my kind
(It's safe in the alternate reality)
So stick your standards where the sun doesn't shine

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
Promise the world then take it from you anyway
They'll break you down, making your vision fade away
It's time to go! (Get outta my space!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here, I will never die

Explain the reasons, explain the rhymes
It's not required, inside our minds

Or take their guilt trip at the end of the line

They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
Promise the world then take the universe away
They'll break you down, making your vision fade away
It's time to go! (Get off of my case!)

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try
Time doesn't exist here
Slip into a world where the air I breathe is mine
Nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind
Come with me into it and you know what you will find
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die

It's always the same
Tears for a time we can never regain
As life drifts away
We search for the reasons we can't make it stay
We walk in a shadowland
Turning to dust, blown away in the wind
One last soul to save
That hangs from a thread off the end of a dream

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side

It's always the same
Mourn for a life we can never reclaim
As time drifts away
We search for the reasons we can't make it stay
Alone in a shadowland
Turning to dust, blown away like the sand
One last soul to save
That hangs off a dream at the end of a thread

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side
We'll jump the great divide
And you'll greet us on the other side
On the other side
On the other side

But you jumped the great divide
So we'll meet you on the other side
We'll jump the great divide
And you'll greet us on the other side

I fought a monster a mile high
Arm wrestled twenty octopi (for you, for... you)
I had a sword fight with a samurai
And sang the sirens a lullaby (for you, for... you)

I’ve pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you

Well I’m not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you

I’ve already crossed my heart and hoped to die

I will take you everywhere I fly

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

You build 'em up
You layer stone on stone
You build 'em high
To keep out your enemies
The sky grows dark
The earth is trembling
An unhappy ending
To your final fantasy

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho
We'll all enjoy the show
When your walls fall like Jericho

You're looking down
And feeling so profound
You're so impressed
By your own false humility
The sky descends
The ground is rising up
An unhappy ending
To your sense of deity

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)
You sit alone
Up on your lonely throne
You're so oblivious
To your own frailty
The sky erupts
The ground has opened wide
An unhappy ending
To the life you've glorified
To the life you've glorified

You feel so safe inside
The walls you fortified
Supremacy implied
Who dares to overthrow?
Arrogance justified
Self-importance amplified
It's down you go
We'll all enjoy the show
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho

(This is over, this is over)
When your walls fall like Jericho
(This is over, this is over)
We'll all enjoy the show
It's do-do-down you go
Can't wait to see you go
When your walls fall like Jericho
(This is over, this is over)
(This is over, this is over)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
