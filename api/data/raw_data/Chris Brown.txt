But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it

And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter

That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
(Nope) Not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white

If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so

Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it

So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man

Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling

I get money when I want, I can fuck her if I want
Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce (Ayy, yeah)
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost (Ayy, yeah)
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off (Ayy, yeah)
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
I know I can break you off, come and let me break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost

Got my own lingo, I can change your whole lil' ego

You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side

Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him

All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, "Keep it drama free"
Woah-woah

Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?

The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)

(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
