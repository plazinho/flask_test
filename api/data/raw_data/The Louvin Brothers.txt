Through the valleys of this life I have wandered
And I've worked for Jesus all along the way
But now I see the sun for me is setting
I have reached the ending of my way
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home
Looking back upon the life I've lived for Jesus
I can see how He has helped me all the way
And the tears I've shed just helped to keep me humble
And each burden only taught me how to pray
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home
Though I hate to leave so many friends behind me
And the parting of our ways will touch my heart
But I'll wait for them inside the gates of heaven
Where the children of God will never part
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray
I attended service at a little church
In the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
"My God is real"
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard
In the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, "Preacher, tell them that satan is real too"
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment
Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astrayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I met a little girl in Knoxville, a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening, out in her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
Oh Willie dear don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My Mother she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying "Dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?"
I told my anxious Mother, I was bleeding at my nose
I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a hankerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night throught, as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see
They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so wellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
Do you fear this man's invention
That they call atomic power
Are we all in great confusion
Do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion
May rain down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction
Blotting out the works of man
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
There is one way to escape it
Be prepared to meet the lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus
He will be your shielding sword
He will surely stay beside you
And you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety
And eternal peace and rest
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
There's an army who can conquer
All the enemy's great band
It's the regiment of Christians
Guided by the Savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls
Fall in all it's fury great
God will surely save His children
From that awful awful fate
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Last night, my dear, the rain was falling
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then, I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
And then we met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
"I don't believe you've met my baby"
You looked at him, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on his shoulder
You smiled at him, he smiled at you
His eyes were filled with victory
He said, "My sister wants to marry"
Then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Kneel at the cross, Christ will meet you there
Come while He waits for you
Listen to His voice, leave with Him your cares
And begin life anew
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there
Kneel at the cross, there is room for all
Who would His glory share
Bliss there awaits, harm can nary fall
Those who are anchored there
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there
Kneel at the cross, give your idols up
Look unto realms above
Turn not away to life's sparkling cup
Trust only in His love
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
Thats made you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Was 19 coaches long
The only girl I ever loved
Is on that train and gone
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blowsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh Katie dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking
She's in her room a takin’ rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Oh Katie dear go ask your father
If you can be a bride of mine
If he says yes come back and tell me
If he says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear, there's no use in asking
He’s in his room a takin’ rest
And by his side there's a golden dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Then he picked up this golden dagger
And stove it through his troubled heart
Saying goodbye Katie goodbye darlin'
At last the time has come to part
Then she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lily-white breast
Saying goodbye papa goodbye mama
I'll die with the one that I love bestEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone else
And asked me if I could forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop wanting you
I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected, transplanted in vain
To a garden of sadness where it's petals would fall
In the shadow of undying pain
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop thinking of you
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop crying for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone

The milkman whistles softly as he comes up to my door
The mailman brings the letters by just like he did before
They seem so busy all day long as though there's nothing wrong
Don't they know the world has ended? My baby's gone

Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone


I wake up sometimes in the night and realize you're gone
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone
But it cries, "The world has ended, my baby's gone"
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
