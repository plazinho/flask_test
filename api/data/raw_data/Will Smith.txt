Make way for Prince Ali

Say hey, it's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a brand new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, boy, genuflect, down on one knee

Ohhh

Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie
Prince AlM, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely
He's faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?

Why, Prince Ali

Fellas, he's got

He's got seventy-five golden camels

Woo, uh-huh, now the ladies, what he got?

Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals, everybody help me out

He's got a zoo
I'm telling you

I's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali, handsome is he
There's no question this Ali's alluring
Ali Ababwa
Never ordinary, never boring
That physique!
Everything about that man
How can I speak, weak at my knees
Just plain impresses
You yummy boy
So, get on out in that square
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
He's about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, oops
And I absolutely love the way he dresses

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys

He got the monkeys, a bunch of monkeys

And to view them he charges no fee

He's generous, so generous

He's got 10,000 servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Aaa-

We waitin' for you
We're not going 'til you go
You can do it
There it is

Prince Ali
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa

Heard your princess was hot, where is she?
And that, good people, is why he got all cute and dropped by

With sixty elephants, llamas galore (For real!?)
With his bears and lions a brass band and more (What?)
With his forty fakirs (Oh!) his cooks, his bakers (Oh!)
His birds that warble on key (Oh!)
Make way for Prince Ali!
 
Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where you wander among every culture and tongue
It's chaotic, but hey, it's home

When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night


As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars
With the cardamom-cluttered stalls
You can smell every spice
While you haggle the price
Of the silks and the satin shawls

Oh, the music that plays
As you move through a maze
In the haze of your pure delight
You are caught in a dance
You are lost in the trance
Of another Arabian night

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
Like Arabian dreams
This mystical land of magic and sand
Is more than it seems

There's a road that may lead you
To good or to greed through
The power your wishing commands
Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold
Well, your destiny lies in your hands
Only one may enter here
One whose worth lies far within
A diamond in the rough

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They seem to excite, take off and take flight
To shock and amaze
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
 
Here I go!
Unh, ooh, woo!
Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! Unh!
You done wound me up!
'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!

Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
All you gotta do is rub that lamp
And then I'll say

Mister– Man, what's your name? Whatever–
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, I'll jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come, whisper to me whatever it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me

We pride ourselves on service
You the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
How about a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me

Oh! Unh!
It's the big part, watch out!
It's the big part, oh!

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Outta they little hat?
Can your friends go–
I'm the genie of the lamp
I can sing, rap, dance, if you give me a chance, oh!

Don't sit there buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so

Mister–

Aladdin

Yes!
One wish or two or three
Well, I'm on the job, you big nabob

When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Gotta get jiggy wit it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it

Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly

Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay papi!"
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject

Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

(This is a good song Dad, how much am I gettin paid for this?)

The title held by me: MiB

Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence

From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like *BOOM* black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MiBs, freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?) Men in Black

Uh, and
The Men in Black
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (bounce with me)

Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze (uh huh huh ha)

Galaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)

But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in

Agitatin me, but they be waitin and hatin
And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie
Keep a nice flow for your mom down in Philly
On the news you go if you blow and act silly, y'know?

He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

Will's a nice guy, why he's so nice I'd
Let him date my daughter like he was a white guy
Not like the rest, he's a private flight guy
Why, if I were gay on Friday night I'd...
Larry Elder - Uncle Tom?
You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Up, girl, better leave me alone
Before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?

He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody'
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on

Whoo hoo what what what a what a say what what
Help out your mom and dad by gettin' a job
So you can help pay for school supplies

Wipe your shoes on the mat when you come in the house
Someone just cleaned that floor

Uh, uh, it's twenty years of swag, y'all just witnessed
Let me remind everybody who Will Smith is
Rappers make it rain, let they money hit ya
If I throw my money up, shit, I'd probably kill a stripper
The illest, realest, Big Will-est
Down with the man in charge of where Uncle Phil is
Everybody wanna do Will Smith numbers
I don't know if your life got that many summers
I got inspired, quickly, I unretired, the Fresh Prince just re-wired
I'm slightly modified, but still
People dancing and shaking and moving and wiling
I feel like I'm an alien, really, kind of an island
I might fly to China for nothing, find a designer
Fix up a crib with me, my mom and Obama
Murder all over the globe, guilty, your honor
Rather become a Mormon, marrying Halle, Rihanna
I'm an anomaly, do drama or comedy
I could play Muhammud Ali or a white lady probably
Still, twenty years of swag y'all just witnessed
Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business
Rebirth of the click track, ridiculous
What I charge for a feature, man, that's expensive
Cause y'all be doing features, I be doing Features
So many tickets that theaters need bleachers
More information from me than from most teachers
More inspiration from me than from most preachers
But wait, wait, wait, wait, truly, just for the record
Directors make movies, I make directors
Y'all dinner table: "What y'all learn today?"
My dinner table: "What y'all earn today?"
The real life Incredibles, last name Smith
Jada, Jaden, Willow, Trey, shit, y'all ain't fucking with my clique
 
Its here and I like it
(Whoo! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!)
(Big Will, uh K-Ci y'all bringing it in)
(What?)
Its here and I like it
(Say what? What?)
(Say what? What?)
Gonna pack the dance floor
(And do what with it?)
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me
What's gonna happen?
Don't nobody know
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares?
Just don't stop the beat
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight
K-Ci you feeling me right? (Yeah)
2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K
The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium (yeah)
It can't get thicker than this (Big Will)
Slick like Rick I can't miss
(And we gonna party like it's 19)
Hold up it is

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

Its here and I like it
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)
Gonna pack the dance floor
(And do what with it?)
Rock the dance floor
(Uh, uh, uh)

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

Say yeah, yeah
(Come on)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(What? What? What?)
Say yeah, yeah
(Come on, come on)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(Ha-ha-ha)
Yeah, yeah

I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year 2G
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

True dat, true dat, true dat
Yo London, uh come on
Yo Bangkok, come on, come on

The NYC
Come on, say what? Say what?
Yo Philly, come on, hey
Hey Tokyo, come on
Everybody say what now
Say what now, say what now
Come on, come on, come on
 
Big Willie!
Get on the floor!

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

Dance, an afrodesiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulatin musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out at night and get a brew and relax
But no! Uh-uh, when you the party starter
It's like, you on call, you what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door and
Shock 'em when it's boring, get on the floor!
Uhh, it's the groovicide bomber
Mic in my vest tight, strapped to my chest like
I'm a run up in the party holla and
Be like, oh! Fulfilling my calling
Big, Will, that's my name
Writing, rhymes, that's my game
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Look, just write your number right next to your name girl

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

He was raised in the days when the roof was raised and
Every rap occasion, new and amazing
The back of the stage is amazed and gazing
Praying for the day they can one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game and made it
Came through the maze and the haze and played it
Perfect, dazed any person hated
And cursed 'em, he was unfazed, he waited
It was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slaving, on the road blazing
Dazed when he was low, nothing could raise him
And came to the show and something uncaged in him
Like the pope of this party crusade
I'm like braids, that's never gon' fade, ya heard?
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade
Throw me into the rave like you threw a grenade, boom!

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know back when rap was smart and multi-layered
We can rap without A&R's and ultimatums, damn!
Now today I say the praise, I long for the good old days
When the party was all about partying
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question, should I run to mine a vittle
Food for thought or, dumb the rhyme a little?
But Will if you come too high
That'll alienate folks, and they won't buy it
Yo, look, people getting trapped in the track
And they be clapping, even when the rappin is wack
And what happened? When did we get happy with that?
He old-fashioned? Yup! Well let's be happy he back, ya heard me?

Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning
 
I-I-I-I woke up this morning
Looked at ya picture
Think about when I'm a get wit'cha
Hit ya on the two-way simply to say I gotta see you today
They say love is a gamble and if so, baby I'm the Belagio I can't lose
And I guess that make you the Mirage
Wait you more exotic than that you like the Taj Mahal momma
You a treasure to me life with you is a pleasure to me
And I'm a make sure no man ever measure to me
Like Run and D you and me are together forever
I got an interview to do (whoo)
Then to the plane, that too (whoo)
Uh wear that black dress boo (whoo)
Then close your eyes and open your heart and I'm a give you
All my love
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

Woke up this morning to invite and couldn't wait to write you
I licked your back and then kissed three little kids that look just like you
Love is magic, can’t explain and sometimes it just happens
Saw your picture your so silly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and
You know my heart you know my thoughts so ruffneck yet you're tender
The only person ever locked up safe was to surrender
All my love (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
Cause I just don't wanna stop

Girl the way you look wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Just so you all wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Yo, yo, mi amor, it's like a Picasso painted your aura
It's like Beethoven composed your vocal tones
Rodin inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man (uh)
Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

(The Black Suits Comin)
(The Black Suits Comin)
I'm Comin... I'm Comin... I'm Comin... I'm Comin
I am the man in black I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak
Yo Im dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all
Dont nothing faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth
Trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depths of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Monumental it's the black suits running in
Chorus 1:
(Nod Ya Head! The Black Suits Comin')
Let me see you (Nod Ya Head! The Black Suits Comin')

Check it
Yo it's this chick right
Serleena, making me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be tripping like
Threatening me and my mens
Trying to get the light
Thinking she's superwoman
But black kryptonite finishing whatever you start son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along
Cause K is back and he hype
What? Bring it on!
Wanna brawl with me? Trying to brawl with me?

Yo, case closed

Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right here
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you

Wait, do you have a man, cause I ain't' into homewrecking
No? ...Aight cool just checking
Look, from a hundred yards you caught my eye
An all my boys said I didn't have the heart to say hi

A brother can't sleep

All I wanna do is be the perfect guy to you
Tell you the truth, it's like (Candy) cause I'm feelin like its callin me
You're tryin ta hold on, but fallin

Cause somethin bringin out the dog in me

Steady plottin on takin ya home
Gettin all inside of your dome, makin you moan

Cause I could get my friends Babe Ruth and Charleston Chew
 
Whyyyyyy, whyyyyyy

It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin my time awakin, turnin my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said "Daddy now we killin 'em back," right right

I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)
Evil plaguin he rewardin
Hate surrender (hate surrender)
Love exaulted! (Love exaulted!)
HOPE ELATED! (HOPE ELATED!)
Negativity DESTROYED AND..

Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin the last word
And why, did her uncles have to molest her
And why, did all them cops have to be shootin to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me why did Mandela have to live in a cage?
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age?
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate?
And why the fuck can't love seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say

I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby

Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin you crazy
But for me I try to see the bright side
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin to hide
Or tryin to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside
Sweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God
