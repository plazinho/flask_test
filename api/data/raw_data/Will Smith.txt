Make way for Prince Ali

Say hey, it's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a brand new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, boy, genuflect, down on one knee

Ohhh

Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie
Prince AlM, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely
He's faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?

Why, Prince Ali

Fellas, he's got

He's got seventy-five golden camels

Woo, uh-huh, now the ladies, what he got?

Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals, everybody help me out
He's got a zoo
I'm telling you

I's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali, handsome is he
There's no question this Ali's alluring
Ali Ababwa
Never ordinary, never boring
That physique!
Everything about that man
How can I speak, weak at my knees
Just plain impresses
You yummy boy
So, get on out in that square
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
He's about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, oops
And I absolutely love the way he dresses

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
He got the monkeys, a bunch of monkeys

And to view them he charges no fee

He's generous, so generous

He's got 10,000 servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Aaa-
We waitin' for you
We're not going 'til you go
You can do it
There it is

Prince Ali
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa

Heard your princess was hot, where is she?
And that, good people, is why he got all cute and dropped by

With sixty elephants, llamas galore (For real!?)
With his bears and lions a brass band and more (What?)
With his forty fakirs (Oh!) his cooks, his bakers (Oh!)
His birds that warble on key (Oh!)
Make way for Prince Ali!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where you wander among every culture and tongue
It's chaotic, but hey, it's home

When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night


As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars
With the cardamom-cluttered stalls
You can smell every spice
While you haggle the price
Of the silks and the satin shawls

Oh, the music that plays
As you move through a maze
In the haze of your pure delight
You are caught in a dance
You are lost in the trance
Of another Arabian night
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
Like Arabian dreams
This mystical land of magic and sand
Is more than it seems

There's a road that may lead you
To good or to greed through
The power your wishing commands
Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold
Well, your destiny lies in your hands
Only one may enter here
One whose worth lies far within
A diamond in the rough

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They seem to excite, take off and take flight
To shock and amaze
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Here I go!
Unh, ooh, woo!
Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! Unh!
You done wound me up!
'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!

Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
All you gotta do is rub that lamp
And then I'll say

Mister– Man, what's your name? Whatever–
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, I'll jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come, whisper to me whatever it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
We pride ourselves on service
You the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
How about a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me

Oh! Unh!
It's the big part, watch out!
It's the big part, oh!

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Outta they little hat?
Can your friends go–
I'm the genie of the lamp
I can sing, rap, dance, if you give me a chance, oh!

Don't sit there buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so
Mister–

Aladdin

Yes!
One wish or two or three
Well, I'm on the job, you big nabob

All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay

In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off

Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay papi!"
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject

Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

(This is a good song Dad, how much am I gettin paid for this?)8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence

From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like *BOOM* black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MiBs, freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?) Men in Black

Uh, and
The Men in Black
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (bounce with me)
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me (slide, slide, slide, slide)
Just slide with me c'mon
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me (walk with me)
Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze (uh huh huh ha)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
Galaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember (no, no)

I know we might seem imposin'
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in
Here come the Men in Black (here they come)
Galaxy defenders (galaxy defenders)

Mr. Nice Guy, relationship advice guy
Light on the vices, priceless smile
Look at the eyes, got the look
Of a survivor, husband, father
Dissed by Eminem, but did it bother him?
Yup, but he classy
Big Will just did another 20 mill', walk right past E
I'm a nice guy, why y'all harassin me, huh?
On the radio they be over-exaggeratin
So blase with they lies, they be aggravatin me
Agitatin me, but they be waitin and hatin
And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie
Keep a nice flow for your mom down in Philly
On the news you go if you blow and act silly, y'know?
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

Will's a nice guy, why he's so nice I'd
Let him date my daughter like he was a white guy
Not like the rest, he's a private flight guy
Why, if I were gay on Friday night I'd...
Larry Elder - Uncle Tom?
You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Up, girl, better leave me alone
Before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all

Yo mic check, mic check, yeah here you go
Nah, he over here
Yeah, I heard he got that hot new thing
It's called "Switch" (switch)
Let's get it going

Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it

Vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Something sexy bout a
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now Switch!

Turn around now switch

Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la

I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like 'Ooo he's a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody'
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on
Switch!
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la
Switch
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, heeeeeeeeeeeeey)

Oh you just gonna stand there huh?
What you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that Switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right here waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that Switch-a-roo
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, Switch

Woo ah ha
I respect women when I'm on a date
I'll take 'em to the park or maybe the museum
And I only try to kiss 'em if they're ready
Whoo hoo what what what a what a say what what
Help out your mom and dad by gettin' a job
So you can help pay for school supplies
A whoo hoo say ho
Wipe your shoes on the mat when you come in the house
Someone just cleaned that floor
A whoo hoo say what what
