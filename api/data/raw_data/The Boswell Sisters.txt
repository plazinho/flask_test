The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me
But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
Until he says he's mine
Now I'm not afraid that he'll leave me
He's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do, I sure don't care
Oh, the object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine, all mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me
But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
Until he says he's mine
Now I'm not afraid he gonna leave me
'Cause he's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do, I sure don't care
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine, all mine
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me
But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
'Til he says he's mine
Now I'm not afraid he's gonna leave me
He's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do, I sure don't care
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine

My face starts turning red
Don't start teasing, I got a reason
The object of my affection
 
I'll go home and pack my clothes
You get your visas 'n' all that
An' away we'll go
Off we're gonna shuffle-uffle-uffle off to Buffalo
To Niagra in a sleeper
No honeymoon that's cheaper
And the train goes slow
Off we're gonna shuffle-uffle-uffle off to Buffalo
Someday, the stork may pay a visit
And leave a little souvenir
Just a little cute "What is it?"
But we'll discuss that later, dear
For silver quarters
Have the porter
Turn the lights down low
Off we're gonna shuffle-uffle-uffle off to Buffalo
Now that we have had the rice and flowers
The knot is tied
I visualize those happy hours
You close by my side
The honeymoon in store
Is one that you'll adore
I'll go home and pack my clothes
You can get your visa 'n' all that
And away we'll go
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo
To Niagra in a sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper
And the train goes slow
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo
Someday, the stork may pay a visit
And leave a little souvenir
Just a little cute "What is it?"
But we'll discuss that later, dear
For a little silver quarter
We can have the pull man porter
Turn the lights down low
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo
I'll go home and pack my clothes
You get your visas 'n' those
Come honey, we're goin'
Shuffle off to Buffalo, Buffalo
To Niagra in a sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper
When the train goes slow
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Someday the stork may pay a visit
And leave a little souvenir
Just a little cute "What is it?"
We got a lotta time to think about that dear
Little silver quarter
We can have the pull man porter
Turn the lights down low
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Hey shuffle, hey shuffle
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Shuffle off to Buffalo
 
Never thought that anyone
In their right mind
Could ever treat
Another human so unkind
Didn't you sneak away
And leave a note behind --
Was that the human thing to do?
Always thought that yours was such
A heart of gold
But after I was sold
On all the tales you told
Didn't you let your kisses turn
From hot to cold --
Was that the human thing to do?
Now I'm not tryin' to patch things up
What's been done must be
Lord, I wouldn't even
Treat a pup
The way you treated me
How could anybody be so darn unfair?
You let me hang around
Til I learned to care
Didn't you even laugh
And leave me cryin' there --
Was that the human thing to do?
"To err is human,"
I heard you say
"Forgiveness is divine."
But all the sweet things
That you may say
Can't mend this heart of mine

Now I just wanna be understood...

Won't you tell me
How could anybody
Be so darn unfair
You let me hang around
Till I learned to care
Didn't you even laugh
And leave me cryin' there --
Was that the human thing to do?
Was that the human thing to do?
 
I'm as happy as a king
Feelin' good 'n' everything
Just like a bird in the spring
Got to let it out
It's my sweetie, can't you guess?
Wild about him, I'll confess
Does he love me? That's why I shout
Everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me
Now everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me
That's plain to see!
That's why everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me, oh
Everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me
Everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me
That's plain to see!
My baby loves me!
Everbody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me
I love my baby and my baby don't love nobody but me!
 
Seems that I'm goin' coo-coo
Dizzy as I can be
Since the day we met, I've been all upset
Something happened to me
All I've got, I find
Is a one-track mind
I put my shoes on my head
My hat on my feet
Forgetful the whole day through
I can't think of nothin' but love
Concentratin' on you
I put my clothes on the bed
Sleep on the seat
I can't figure two and two
Got crazy ways, I'm in a daze
Concentratin' on you
I had a perfect memory
Until you came along
Now since your spell is over me
My brain seems all wrong
Sometimes I stand in my flat
Don't know where I'm at
I pay bills before they're due
Got you to thank, my mind's a blank
Concentratin' on you

I put my shoes on my head
Hat on my feet
Forgetful the whole day through
I can't think of nothin' but love
Concentratin' on you
I put my clothes on the bed
Sleep on a chair
I can't figure two and two
Got crazy ways, I'm in a daze
Concentratin' on you
I had a perfect memory
Until you came along
Now since your spell is over me
My brain seems all wrong
Sometimes I stand in my flat
Don't know where I'm at
I pay bills before they're due
Got you to thank, my mind's a blank
Just concentratin' on you
 
Verse:
Hear that whistle, there goes the bell
That means we're on our way
All a-board! Boy I'm feelin' swell
This is my happy day!
Paddle wheel, you're mighty mighty slow
That's why I keep shouting "Let her go!"
Chorus:
Roll on you Mississippi, Roll on
Come on you lazy steamer, move on
Clear the river, here we come
Watch her smoke, boy
Hear that engine hummin' Lawdy!
Take a look at the shore..
Soon I'll be with the folks I adore
There's a spot 'round the bend
That's my home, my journey's end
Come n you Old Man River, come on!
Roll on you Mississippi, roll on!
 
Come and meet
Those dancing feet
On the avenue I'm taking you to
Forty-Second Street
Hear the beat
Of dancing feet
It's the song I love the melody of
Forty-Second Street
Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet
Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite
Forty-Second Street
Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent, sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet
Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite
Forty-Second Street
Forty-Second Street
Naughty, bawdy
Gaudy, sporty
Forty
Forty-Second Street
 
I'm just a little "Jackie Horner"
Since I met my sugar cane
That gang of mine has been revealin'
That they're feelin' sore
I left the lamp light on the corner
For the moon in lover's lane
I'm doing things I never did before
When I take my sugar to tea, all the
Boys are jealous of me, 'cause I
Never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea
I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me
She's a high hat baby, that's she
So I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea
Ev'ry Sunday afternoon
We forget about our cares
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz
With those millionaires
When I take my sugar to tea
I'm as Ritzy as can be
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea
 
When I kiss a cutie, no matter who
I'm in trainin' for you
If I hug a beauty, honest and true
I'm in trainin' for you
Why sweetheart, you must realize
My arms need the exercise
I'll be in condition when I get through
I'm in trainin' for you
Somebody told me that love's a game
We have to watch every play
So if I'm practicin', I'm not to blame
I must improve every day
If you see me neckin' somebody new
I'm in trainin' for you
Learning every second just what to do
I'm in trainin' for you
You're sincere, of that I'm sure
You don't want no amateur
What I learn from others I'll teach you too
I'm in trainin' for you
 
It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store
The rain continued for an hour
I hung around for three or four
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store
She was selling china
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying china
Until the crowd got wise
Incidentally
If you should run into a shower
Just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all
Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place
For example, take my case
She was selling china
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying china
Until the crowd got wise
Incidentally
If you should run into a shower
Oh, step inside my cottage door
And meet my million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store
 
You made the rivers flow, the flowers grow
You made the weak and the strong
But, Lord, you made the night too long
You made the robin sing a song of spring
And me you gave a lovely song
Oh, Lord, that's why this night's so long
I've got a heart and I've got a cabin
The door is open wide
What good's a heart and what good's a cabin
If nobody lives inside
You made the mountain high, the earth, the sky
So who am I to say you're wrong?
But Lord, you made the night too long
You gave me arms, but they're empty
You gave me hope. It's empty too
I'm singin' hallelujah, hallelujah to you
Believin' in you, believin' in you
It's not my fault my heart keeps cryin'
Lord, you made the night too long
 
Come on in
Oh ma honey, oh ma honey
Better hurry and let's meander
Ain't you goin', ain't you goin'?
To the leader man, ragged meter man
Oh ma honey, oh ma honey
Let me take you
To Alexander's grand stand, brass band
Ain't you comin' along?
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle
Like you never heard before
That's so natural that you want to go to war
That's just the bestest band what am
Oh, honey lamb
Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, to the man
Who's the leader of the band?
If you want to hear that Swanee Music
Played in ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Come on and hear Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Come on and hear Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle
Like you never heard before
That's so natural that you want to go to war
That's just the best band what am
Oh, honey lamb
Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man
Who's the leader of the band?
Come on along, come on along
Call this Alexander's ragtime band
Come on along, gather around
Call this Alexander's ragtime band
 
Sleep, come on and take me
Until my love comes home
Sleep, don't you forsake me
'Cause I'm so all alone
All the time I'm by my own somehow
My heart keeps bumping me
Can't you see I'm sad and lonesome
For the want of company
Sleep, come on and take me
Until my love comes home
Old men sleep
For every lover you paint a new tomorrow
Old men sleep
And you discover a way to chase away my sorrows
Please don't wait until tomorrow
Sleep, listen to me why don't you come and take me
'Til my love comes home
Sleep, listen to me, now please don't forsake me
I'm so all alone
All the time I'm by my own some
My heart's pumping me
Can't you see I'm sad and lonesome
For the want of company, lordy, lord
Sleep, listen to me why don't you come and take me
'Til my love comes home, alone
Comes alone, till my love comes home
 
I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town
I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town
Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way
St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere
I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me
I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die
 
I don?t want you
But I hate to lose you
You?ve got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you
?cause I can?t forget you
You?ve got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you
But I guess I love you
You?ve got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea
 
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love
Doggone, it hit me from heaven up above
The day I met him, my, I knew I was gone
My heart went kerplunk oh, boy I was sunk
Doggone I've done it, I fell with a thud
It must be springtime 'cos it's in my blood
Mr. Cupid sneaked behind and gave me a shove
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love, oh you dove!
I don't use strong expressions
I'm known for my repression
Nobody ever heard me swear
But something's gone and changed me
It's really disarranged me
I'm cuttin' loose and I don't care
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love
Doggone, it hit me from heaven above
The day I met him I just knew I was gone
Heart went kerplunk, oh boy I was sunk
Doggone I've done it, I fell with a thud
It must be springtime 'cos it's in my blood
Mr. Cupid sneaked behind and gave me a shove
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love
Doggone I've done it I've fallen in love
Doggone, it hit me from heaven above
Day I met him I knew I was gone
Heart went kerplunk, oh boy I was sunk
Doggone I've done it I fell with a thud
It must be springtime 'cos it's in my blood
Mr. Cupid gave me a shove
Doggone I've done it, I've fallen in love
 
I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
Better be ready 'bout half past eight
Now honey don't be late
I wanna be there when that band starts playing
Just remember when we get there honey
Blue steps i'm gonna have them all
Dance all ? my shoes when they play those jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutters ball
