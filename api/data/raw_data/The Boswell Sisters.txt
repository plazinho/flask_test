The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me
But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
Until he says he's mine
Now I'm not afraid that he'll leave me
He's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do, I sure don't care
Oh, the object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine, all mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me
But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
Until he says he's mine
Now I'm not afraid he gonna leave me
'Cause he's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do, I sure don't care
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine, all mine
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me
But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
'Til he says he's mine
Now I'm not afraid he's gonna leave me
He's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do, I sure don't care
The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy red
Anytime he holds my hand
And tells me that he's mine

My face starts turning red
Don't start teasing, I got a reason
The object of my affectionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'll go home and pack my clothes
You get your visas 'n' all that
An' away we'll go
Off we're gonna shuffle-uffle-uffle off to Buffalo
To Niagra in a sleeper
No honeymoon that's cheaper
And the train goes slow
Off we're gonna shuffle-uffle-uffle off to Buffalo
Someday, the stork may pay a visit
And leave a little souvenir
Just a little cute "What is it?"
But we'll discuss that later, dear
For silver quarters
Have the porter
Turn the lights down low
Off we're gonna shuffle-uffle-uffle off to Buffalo
Now that we have had the rice and flowers
The knot is tied
I visualize those happy hours
You close by my side
The honeymoon in store
Is one that you'll adore
I'll go home and pack my clothes
You can get your visa 'n' all that
And away we'll go
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo
To Niagra in a sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper
And the train goes slow
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo
Someday, the stork may pay a visit
And leave a little souvenir
Just a little cute "What is it?"
But we'll discuss that later, dear
For a little silver quarter
We can have the pull man porter
Turn the lights down low
Off we're gonna shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo
I'll go home and pack my clothes
You get your visas 'n' those
Come honey, we're goin'
Shuffle off to Buffalo, Buffalo
To Niagra in a sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper
When the train goes slow
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Someday the stork may pay a visit
And leave a little souvenir
Just a little cute "What is it?"
We got a lotta time to think about that dear
Little silver quarter
We can have the pull man porter
Turn the lights down low
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Hey shuffle, hey shuffle
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Shuffle off to BuffaloEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Never thought that anyone
In their right mind
Could ever treat
Another human so unkind
Didn't you sneak away
And leave a note behind --
Was that the human thing to do?
Always thought that yours was such
A heart of gold
But after I was sold
On all the tales you told
Didn't you let your kisses turn
From hot to cold --
Was that the human thing to do?
Now I'm not tryin' to patch things up
What's been done must be
Lord, I wouldn't even
Treat a pup
The way you treated me
How could anybody be so darn unfair?
You let me hang around
Til I learned to care
Didn't you even laugh
And leave me cryin' there --
Was that the human thing to do?
"To err is human,"
I heard you say
"Forgiveness is divine."
But all the sweet things
That you may say
Can't mend this heart of mine

Now I just wanna be understood...

Won't you tell me
How could anybody
Be so darn unfair
You let me hang around
Till I learned to care
Didn't you even laugh
And leave me cryin' there --
Was that the human thing to do?
Was that the human thing to do?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm as happy as a king
Feelin' good 'n' everything
Just like a bird in the spring
Got to let it out
It's my sweetie, can't you guess?
Wild about him, I'll confess
Does he love me? That's why I shout
Everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me
Now everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me
That's plain to see!
That's why everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me, oh
Everybody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me
Everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me
That's plain to see!
My baby loves me!
Everbody loves my baby
But my baby don't love nobody but me
Nobody but me
I love my baby and my baby don't love nobody but me!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Seems that I'm goin' coo-coo
Dizzy as I can be
Since the day we met, I've been all upset
Something happened to me
All I've got, I find
Is a one-track mind
I put my shoes on my head
My hat on my feet
Forgetful the whole day through
I can't think of nothin' but love
Concentratin' on you
I put my clothes on the bed
Sleep on the seat
I can't figure two and two
Got crazy ways, I'm in a daze
Concentratin' on you
I had a perfect memory
Until you came along
Now since your spell is over me
My brain seems all wrong
Sometimes I stand in my flat
Don't know where I'm at
I pay bills before they're due
Got you to thank, my mind's a blank
Concentratin' on you

I put my shoes on my head
Hat on my feet
Forgetful the whole day through
I can't think of nothin' but love
Concentratin' on you
I put my clothes on the bed
Sleep on a chair
I can't figure two and two
Got crazy ways, I'm in a daze
Concentratin' on you
I had a perfect memory
Until you came along
Now since your spell is over me
My brain seems all wrong
Sometimes I stand in my flat
Don't know where I'm at
I pay bills before they're due
Got you to thank, my mind's a blank
Just concentratin' on youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Verse:
Hear that whistle, there goes the bell
That means we're on our way
All a-board! Boy I'm feelin' swell
This is my happy day!
Paddle wheel, you're mighty mighty slow
That's why I keep shouting "Let her go!"
Chorus:
Roll on you Mississippi, Roll on
Come on you lazy steamer, move on
Clear the river, here we come
Watch her smoke, boy
Hear that engine hummin' Lawdy!
Take a look at the shore..
Soon I'll be with the folks I adore
There's a spot 'round the bend
That's my home, my journey's end
Come n you Old Man River, come on!
Roll on you Mississippi, roll on!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Come and meet
Those dancing feet
On the avenue I'm taking you to
Forty-Second Street
Hear the beat
Of dancing feet
It's the song I love the melody of
Forty-Second Street
Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet
Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite
Forty-Second Street
Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent, sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet
Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite
Forty-Second Street
Forty-Second Street
Naughty, bawdy
Gaudy, sporty

I'm just a little "Jackie Horner"
Since I met my sugar cane
That gang of mine has been revealin'
That they're feelin' sore
I left the lamp light on the corner
For the moon in lover's lane
I'm doing things I never did before
When I take my sugar to tea, all the
Boys are jealous of me, 'cause I
Never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea
I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me
She's a high hat baby, that's she
So I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea
Ev'ry Sunday afternoon
We forget about our cares
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz
With those millionaires
When I take my sugar to tea
I'm as Ritzy as can be
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to teaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I kiss a cutie, no matter who
I'm in trainin' for you
If I hug a beauty, honest and true
I'm in trainin' for you
Why sweetheart, you must realize
My arms need the exercise
I'll be in condition when I get through
I'm in trainin' for you
Somebody told me that love's a game
We have to watch every play
So if I'm practicin', I'm not to blame
I must improve every day
If you see me neckin' somebody new
I'm in trainin' for you
Learning every second just what to do
I'm in trainin' for you
You're sincere, of that I'm sure
You don't want no amateur
What I learn from others I'll teach you too
I'm in trainin' for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
