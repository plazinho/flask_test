I'm wide open
But don't I please you anymore?
You're slipping away from me
You're drifting away from me
I'm wide open
But don't I please you anymore?
You're slipping away from me
You're slipping away from me

Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me

I'm wide open
But I couldn't see it anymore
You're drifting away from me
You're slipping away from me
I'm wide open
I'm wide open
I'm wide open

One day just gonna see me
Look back and forth from the ceiling
(I'm wide open)
Some day love's gonna hurt me
Turn back and soon I'll believe it

Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me

I'm wide open
I'm wide open
Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
 
Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't think, can't...

Everything gettin' harder to find
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
See we get to the end but that's where we begin
You feel it
Mannequins say "We breakin' the mold"
Breakin' out and we breakin' the codes
Similar to the Jacques Cousteau
To the depths and you're wet
So your tank explodes, so get it out
Send your body to flight
Everybody got a target tonight
Everybody come along for the ride
All you studs and you duds and you ladies, let's fly
Grip the moment like you grippin' the earth
Feel the weight and you feelin' the girth
Now you get it, now you feelin' your worth
Feel the sound you used to make when everything used to hurt
It goes

Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go

Gotta go, gotta make it in time
Brightest star gonna be the guide
Gotta get you to the other side
To where the butterflies and where the peach reside
The first five minutes for the fifteen of fame
Five seconds 'fore you're saying my name
I'm deadly sharpshooting the game
Gonna hit you and this whole execution is aim
Get together and we building a fire
Clear smoke and it's taking us higher
Hands up, everyone is one
If you see yourself making it
You're seeing the sun
Metropolis on the edge of control
They take our money, but they won't take our soul
Fuck that, ain't gon' do it no mo'
Won't do what we told and we ain't gonna fold
We go

Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins

Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
 
Don't hold back, 'cause you woke up in the morning
With initiative to move, so why make it harder?
Don't hold back, if you think about it
So many people do, be cool man, look smarter
Don't hold back, and you shouldn't even care
'Bout the losers in the air and their crooked stares
Don't hold back, 'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care

Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on, come on, come on with it

Don't hold back, if you think about it too much
You may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back, you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up, c'mon keep pace
Don't hold back, put apprehension on the back burner
Let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back, get involved with the jam
Don't be a prick, hot chick be a pig

Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on with that, come on with it

World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, my finger is on the button
My finger is on the button
My finger is on the button (Push the button)
The time has come to
Galvanize
 
Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fatlip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon (What it do?)
Today, we're gonna teach you some fun facts about salmon
And a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip-hop star
See anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, peep game, I'ma show you how
Put your hands to the side, as silly as it seems
And shake your body like a salmon floating up stream

I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it, you know how we do it)
Again

All my peeps spend part of their life in freshwater
And part of their life in saltwater
Wow, very interesting
We change 'round a couple of days after spawning, then we die

When I first did the salmon, all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud, "What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing The Snap"
But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, "Yo, that nigga's killing it"
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating up stream

I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it, you know how we do it)
Again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow!
My family also rely on ocean currents, tides (Uh-huh)
Gravitational pull of the moon (I'll float up stream)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?!
Wow! Who knew? (Again)
Did you know...
What?
...that I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me! Amazing... geez
Polluted water can kill both baby salmon that are developing
And the adult salmon that are on their way to spawn
Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Huh? Whoa!
Wow, hey, kids, hey, give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing Salmon Dance
Huh, what do you say? Alright
Who's hungry?
 
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha

Oh
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Yeeeh (oh)
Am I coming through?
Am I coming through?
Is this sweet and pure and true?

Devil came by this morning
Said he had something to show me
I was looking like I've never seen a face before
Here we go now, let's slide in through the open door

Pictures and things that I've done before
Circling around me, I'm here on the floor
I'm dreaming this and I'm dreaming that
Regretting nothing, think about that

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord, I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I've almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain what I've seen
I'm happy now to have seen it
To find that the images are fading away

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain the things I've seen
But now I think I see the light
Now I think I see the light

Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
Now I'm home, and I'm free
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?

(You'd better go to bed now)

My heart and soul, they are free
My heart and soul they are free

(Oh)
You know I almost lost my mind
Now I'm home, and I'm free

And how does it feel like
To wake up in the sun?
And how does it feel like
To shine on everyone?
And how does it feel like
To let forever be?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony

And how does it feel like
To sail in on the breeze?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony

And how does it feel like
To make it happening?
And how does it feel like
To breathe with everything?
And how does it feel like
To let forever be?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?

Scream a symphony

And how does it feel like
To be a crystalline?
And how does it feel like
To spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?
