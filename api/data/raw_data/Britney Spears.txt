Show me
How you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby

Don't you know I still believe

Hit me, baby, one more time
 
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

And make me oooh (Move), oooh, oooh (Yeah), oooh

Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, you make me oooh
 
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move uneasy

And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
 
Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em

Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?
 
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh, I know, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay, he's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear, I don't care

'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

(Oh, I know, oh) Mama I'm in love with a criminal
(Should've let go) And this type of love isn't rational
(But no) It's physical
(Oh, I know, oh) Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
(Should've let go) All reason aside
(But no) I just can't deny, love the guy

I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous

(You want a piece of me?)

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
Trying, and pissing me off
Well, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me?
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Strippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'
Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (Oh, oh)
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin' this (Like-like-like-like a circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like-like-like-like a circus)

All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causing a commotion
Like a slumber party

No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party

Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Loving me so hard it's causing trouble
If there's seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple
Like a slumber party

No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go

We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go

Like a slumber party
A slumber party, yeah

No one but, no one but you and I, I, I

I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, "Little girl, don’t step into the club"
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah (Now watch me)

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(This feels good)

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there

I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age (Let's go)

Like that
You like it?
Yeah
Now watch me

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(This feels good)

I really wanna dance tonight with you (I just can’t help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to (I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you (I wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to (Uh, uh, uh)

Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age

I’m a slave for you (Like that)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you (It just feels right, it just feels good)
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it, baby

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(It's just you and me)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh

J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon amour
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon amour
Comme une, coupure électrique
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon amour

Un moment avec toi, dans le noir
Un moment avec toi, dans le noir
Comme une coupure électrique
T'es la lumière, t'es la lumière

J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon amour
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon amour
Comme une, coupure électrique
J'oublie le monde, quand tu fais
Fais-moi l'amour, mon amour
 
Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself (I said it again)

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (why is it so difficult?), so difficult
Château Marouatte
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon
 
I want your attention in this room
Your eyes on mine
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold
You make me come alive

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low

We don't need crowds, we just need us
All my feelings are, about to erupt
All my tricks, they're spectacular
My encore is immaculate

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low

Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low

Strut it out, strut it out, eyes on me (Eyes on me)
Watch me strike a pose, feel my heat (Feel my heat)
Spin it 'round, spin it 'round, three-sixty
Ain’t no boundaries here, no cameras, please
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, so entertaining
Ooh, ooh

Put on a private show

Credits are closing now
Guess that's the end
Can we go again?
Can we do it all again?
Nah, I'll take a bow
Up, down, run it ‘round
Tasting on my apple pie
Apple pie, satisfy
 
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
