Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

Yeah, hey, yay

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

Yeah, hey, yay


And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

A denial, a denial

Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you, we broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard, but I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there and I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Yeah, yeah

Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, havenâ€™t told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
 
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again

He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't knows not what it means
Don't knows what it means, when I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means, don't know what it means, and I say, "Yeah"

We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means, and I say

And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means, and I say, "Yeah"

Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah

Do it and do it again
Waste me

You're gonna stink and burn

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
 
What else should I be? All apologies
What else could I say? Everyone is gay
What else could I write? I don't have the right
What else should I be? All apologies

In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried

I wish I was like you, easily amused
Find my nest to salt, everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn, choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
Married, buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

 Thank you. This was written by my favorite performer. Our favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
 Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of Leadbelly's guitar
 Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000
 Passing a basket
 Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through (Shiver for me)

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines the sun don't shine
I'd shiver... the whole night through

Thank you
