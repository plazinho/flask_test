City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
(*beep*)

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha
(Ha! Haha! Haha! Haha! Ha!)

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

All my life

And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal day

With the holograms beside me, I'll dance alone tonight
In a mirrored world, are you beside me
All my life?
Distortion

All my life
Saturnz about to make love and I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in 'cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal day
 
Up on Melancholy Hill, there's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream
Where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
Does anybody know, love
If we're looking out on the day of another dream?
If you can't get what you want, then you come with me
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits the manatee, love
Just looking out for the day when you're close to me
When you're close to me
When you're close to me
 
You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

The roof is on fire, she wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, they hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy, them stars falling, don't chase 'em

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

Attack on Iraq, it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn {Obama} to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby

When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
I put it to the right man
He put it back

Talk to the crowds
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down

Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart now, love her
Andromeda, Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down
 
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's dare (Uh)
It's dare

You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

Never did no harm, never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare (Uh)

You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking

Hold it down, there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth

Never did no harm, never did no harm

Never did no harm, never did no harm

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

(Uh)
(Mmmmm)

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, "Taxi"
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
 
Slow it down some, no split, clown bum
Your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at?
Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
Would have floated, bloated, voted
Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away
(Oh, what they say)
Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away

Bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes, you can, like "Can I Kick It?" Wicked
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope Diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit
(Zzzt!) A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beats got family members askin' him for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em, "Clean it"
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said, "Nah, fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?"

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away
Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come
When it's gone away

When it's
When it's gone away
 
Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
(If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?)
I don't want this isolation
(Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail)
See the state I'm in now?
(And let you down?)

If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you go?
 
I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people who are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance


I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people who are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

In my backpack, I got my act right in case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken
With anger and discontent some are seeking
In search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box, six under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder
With lightning-fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
"The war is over", so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself among
 
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (She's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover
(She's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar
Nothing to be justified yet
She the first I'm running with
She the one that get my collar
She the one I'm running with

She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar

I'm yellow, he was blue
It's nothing that he could hide
We made a green meadow
Whenever we would collide
She's my collar
I died a thousand times
I did what I had to do
Hey, that's just how it goes
I'm still coming back to you

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
(You, you, you)
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
(You, you, you, you)
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now
(She's my collar)
I don't take her number just don't think I'd call her
(You, you, you)
I take a damn summer dreading all day
(You, you, you, you)
I clear my system, I don't need no other
(You, you, you)
This is my persona, secret lover
(She's my collar)

She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar
Oh, she's my collar
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Momentary bliss

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)
"What was scripted, the day before it happened?"
We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out it did your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But mining for metal gave you platinum

It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

Poster boy (Ayy)
Poster girl (Rita)
In truth, the bills (The bills)
Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Poster boy (Yeah, alright)
Poster girl (Ah, that's time)

In truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left is sodden cake, typical
Oh, you need to change your face
You're getting sold, it's such a waste
Y'know, we could do so much better than this
Swimming in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it
Meanwhile, you keep on adding
How big you gonna grow?

It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita
We could do so much better than this
Perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita
 
The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Yeah, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

Here you go! Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between its brain and its tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Yeah, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

Okay, bring it down here
We goin' back out

Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
 
I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
The shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say "I'm leaving" to you
You've gotta volunteer, and you don't know what to do
You're soft

You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

I’m impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
I’m at Lay Chimirida, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just kicked down, I love when I’m seen
Yeah, and if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get popped here, you get ‘em a lot
You get a heart, break

You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doin', baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doin'?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aha)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

New word, onomatopoeia (Boom)
Quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad cause the winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duked, gotta get duked, the duke
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about
"Ah, he don't rap enough"
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like "Wrap it up, hoe"
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfuckin' momma
Bet you still stay with your motherfuckin' momma
Keep sleeping on me, I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come Blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all this
Fly shit, I stay finna take off

Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane

Bet it up, head erupts
A lava language in a vocal volcanic
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddamn it
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush
Man, they sound like, man, they stole your
Man, they look like—nope, it ain't us

Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
Do Ya damn Thing, Do Ya Thing-a-Thing
You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang

Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care (I don't care)
But it's true, you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

Flip the page, our days are revelatious
Space is strange, doctor, I've got no patience
Oh, it's all a part of the process (Okay, okay)
Nothing's new, it's true, cool, I admit
Shit, I guess you're right
