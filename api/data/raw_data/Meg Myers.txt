Hush now baby, there's no need to cry
Let me wipe away those lemon eyes
All your worries, such a waste of time
You can't even see how much you're mine

You're so bitter, bitter, bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle, down okay
Listen, you listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy

Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine

Hold on baby, careful what you say
You've been drinking someone else's pain
I can't keep on staring at the sun
Yellow, I will have to bite your tongue

You're so bitter, bitter. bitter, yellow
Settle, settle, got to settle down okay
Listen, you listen, you listen, yellow
It's a killer, a killer, a killer, jealousy
Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide
Lemon eyes, all mine

(All mine)
And the doctor said you're fine (all fine)
Just a case of lemon eyes (all fine)
See I told you were mine (all mine)
(Lemon eyes)

Lemon eyes, you're mine
Yellow eyes, all mine
I bet you wanna walk away, run away, look away, turn away
Honey you can't hide

You're weak, broken in a motel
You blink, tears are falling down, down, down
And you're free, free inside your own hell
You speak, "Someone let me out, out, out"

And I can't stop this pain it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
Show me what I'm really living for

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna

Your dreams, slowly turn against you
Your feet, sink into the ground, ground, ground
And you bleed, naked in a black room
You scream, "Someone let me out, out, out"

And I can't stop this pain it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
Show me what I'm really living for

"How come most of your songs are sad songs?"
"Well you know, I don't think they're all that sad. I have a few that aren't sad, they're like hopeless, totally hopeless situation. And the rest aren't sad, they're just the way it goes. I mean, you don't think life's sad? But from recognizing the sadness you can put it aside, be happy and enjoy the happy side of life."

When all is said and done
Tell me how to write this, tell me how to fight this war
I'll keep marchin' on
Like a broken robot, money back guarantee

I'm in your custody
But I'm not a criminal, I can be your next big thing
Look at what I've become
Silly little monster, should've just held my tongue

I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb

Sometimes I wish I could fly
Through a secret trap door, into another life (life)
Bury my head in the sand
I don't want to grow up, la la la la la la la
I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb

I'll play the game, I'll do everything you tell me
All the losers win in the end
I'll play the game, I'll do anything you tell me
All the losers win in the end

I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb

It doesn't hurt me
Do you want to feel how it feels?
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?

It's you
It's you and me

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

Come on, baby
Come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
So, if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems (For the ones we love)

Say, if I only could (If I only could)
With no problems (There's so much hate for the ones we love)

I couldn't sleep last night
There were lions and bears tearing you from my side
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like my daughter, it's burned in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
And I can't tell anyone the morning after you

I couldn't sleep last night
You were chasing the birds till the beast caught your eye
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like an angel, it's burned in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
And I can't tell anyone the morning after you

And I hope you sleep with a merry gold
I hope you win it this time
And I pray you don't fear the animals
I'll save you, I promise this time
I couldn't sleep last night
There were lions and bears tearing you from my side
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like my daughter, it's burned in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
I would give anything1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
My heart is wasted, cut up like a drug
And your tears they taste like vinegar in blood
And these conversations choke us till we're numb
No matter what we're saying, it never seems enough

So take me to the start
Take me to that kiss
Because I got to know, baby, what I'll forget

Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love, until the end of time

My voice is twisted, guilty goes the tongue
Your eyes are faded, they used to turn me on
And our skin is dangerous, villians when we touch
No matter what we're feeling, it never feels enough

So take me to the start
And take me to that kiss
Because I got to know, baby, what I'll forget
Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want me to say?
Sorry that I lost our love, until the end of time

Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes

And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want from me
So sorry, sorry, what do you want, what do you want me to say
Sorry that I lost our love, without a reason why
Sorry that I lost our love, it really hurts sometimes
And I'm sorry, sorry
What do you want, what do you want me to say

Just wanna dance with you all night
When everyone has their disguise
I'll show you my heart is real
I'll show you how this could feel

This moment shaking in my hands
I'll share this secret for a chance
Just to be here with you
Just to get lost with you

When it's cold, I just wanna feel your touch
When it's cold, there's nobody else I'd rather know

I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

I'm writing letters in my head
I sign my name but never send
All of my thoughts are you
All of my mind's on you
I stole this sweater from your car
So I'd have you all night in my arms
Now as I go to sleep
I got you here with me

When it's cold, I just wanna feel your touch
When it's cold, there's nobody else I'd rather know

I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?
I'm falling in deep
Do you already know my love is after you?

And everything's right, everything's wrong
When you call my name
I can't handle the thought of always being gone
When I'm wearing this ring and I wanna go out, I wanna get drunk
Being in love
And I don't wanna fight but nothing makes sense anymore

And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe
And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it runs, it runs like lightning through my teeth

I want you to tell me what to do
I want you to tell me what you need
When you look at me like you do
Don't leave, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And everything's right, everything's wrong
When you call my name
All the hands on the clock keep moving along
While we're staying the same
I don’t wanna go out, I wanna get drunk
And litter my lungs
And I know it ain't right but nothing makes sense anymore
And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe
And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it runs, it runs like lightning in my teeth

I want you to tell me what to do
I want you to tell me what you need
When you look at me like you do
Don't leave, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I really want you to hate me
I really want you to find
That I am bitter and angry
That I'm no mother of a child
I really want you to hate me
I really want you to find
That I'm the ugliest girl
And I will never be a bride

There's no love for the wicked
There's no love to survive
There's no love can you listen
There's no love and
I'm feeling high
I wanna die

I really want you to hate me
I really want you to find
That I am far from a lady
That I'm an animal inside

I should pray for Adelaide
But she wouldn't win this fight
Black and blue dear Adelaide
So many scars to hide

Waving my hands
You don't break
You don't understand
Lie to my face
Run away
You're just that kind of man

Every moment I surrender
Such a waste of love
You can't hold me down boy
Tell me what the hell you want
And I don't wanna cry about it
I don't wanna fight about it
I just gotta let go, I just gotta let go
I don't wanna cry about it
I don't wanna fight about it
I just gotta let you go
I should pray for Adelaide
But she don't hear a goddamn word that I say
Oh I'm so ashamed of Adelaide
How do you justify every moment he takes

Waving my hands
You don't break
You don't understand
Lie to my face
Run away
You're just that kind of man

Every moment I surrender
Such a waste of love
You can't hold me down boy
Tell me what the hell you want
And I don't wanna cry about it
I don't wanna fight about it
I just gotta let go, I just gotta let go
I don't wanna cry about it
I don't wanna fight about it
I just gotta let you go
And I'm buried in the silence
And my eyes are closed
Got me like a spider
Trapped in your

I can barely speak
Black and white bed sheets
I feel the air retreat
I know you're here with me

How do I fake it with another man?
How do I love him on the weekend?
How do I listen to another man?
How do I get off on the weekend?

You're in my heart, in my heart, in my head
You're in my heart, in my heart, in my head
You're in my heart, in my heart, in my head
You're in my heart, in my heart, in my head

Pressure on my lips
I die for just one kiss
Wake, I can't resist
Could I be dreaming this?

How do I fake it with another man?

I never had it bad like this before
I gained a couple battle scars, but I never thought I'd be losing this war
Surrender doesn't cut it like it did before
So you can put your white flag down, hold out your hand
Don't let go 'cause this love is worth fighting for

And sometimes it feels like the winter has come
And sometimes I bleed like, run, river, run
And sometimes it don't feel right, like you're my enemy
And sometimes I question whether you'll be the death of me
Whether you'll be the death of me

Do you remember when you were young?
Before you went and built a wall out of a heart of stone
No one can reach you, you're on your own
Don't give up on yourself too soon
If you're looking for a deeper love, jump down inside
There's nowhere to run and there's nowhere for you to hide

And sometimes it feels like the winter has come
And sometimes I bleed like, run, river, run
And sometimes it don't feel right, like you're my enemy
And sometimes I question whether you'll be the death of me
Whether you'll be the death of me
My angel, if you fall
I will catch you
I will catch you
My lover in the night
I will meet you
I will meet you

And sometimes it feels like the winter has come
And sometimes I bleed like, run, river, run
And sometimes it don't feel right, like you're my enemy
And sometimes I question whether you'll be the death of me
Whether you'll be the death of me

Whether you'll be the death of me
(I will catch you, I will catch you)
Whether you'll be the death of me
(I will meet you, I will meet you)
Whether you'll be the death of meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
