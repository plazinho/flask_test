For your love
For your love
For your love
I give you everything and more, and that's for sure
For your love
I bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
For your love

To thrill you with delight, I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love

For your love, for your love
I would give the stars above
For your love, for your love
I would give you all I could

For your love
For your love
For your love
I'd give the moon if it were mine to give
For your love
I'd give the stars and the sun for I live
For your love
To thrill you with delight, I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
"Where is she, tell me where?"

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul


And I know
If she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul
She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
{intro}
See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing, they kiss your tears when you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
See the rain hide away in disgrace
Still I'm sad
{Bridge}
For myself my tears just fall into dust
Day will dry them, night will find they are lost
Now I find the wind is blowing time into my heart
Let the rain fall, for we are apart
How I'm sad
How I'm sad
Oh, how I'm sad1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Can you judge a man
By the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind
By the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man
By the pattern on his tie?

Then Mister you're a better man than I
Yeah Mister You're a better man than I
Oh Mister You're a better man than I
Yeah Mister You're a better man than I

Could you tell a wise man
By the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important
Than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool
If for wealth he doesn't strive


Could you condemn a man
If your faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin
Is the colour of his soul?
Or could you say if men
For king and country all must die?

Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen?
When time and tide have been

Fall into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Soon I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't disgrace my kindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Cars and girls are easy come by in this day and age
Laughing, joking, drinking, smoking
'Till I've spent my wage
When I was young people spoke of im-mor-ality
All the things they said were wrong
Are what I want to be

Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I find comment 'bout my looks irrelativity
Think I'll go and have some fun
Cause it's all for free
I'm not searching for a reason to enjoy myself
Seems it's better done
Than argued with somebody else
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down

Aboard a train
I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City
As we strut down on that ol' fairlane
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
I made a stop round Albuquerque
She must'a thought I was real gone jerk
Got off the train at El Paso
A' looking so good I couldn't let her go
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm dazed and confused
Is it stay, is it go?
Give me a clue
'Cos I just want to know
Give me a clue as to where I am at
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat
I'm dazed and confused
Hangin' on by a thread
I've been abused
I'd be better off dead
Can't stand the heat
And I'm starting to crack
If you're out to get me
You're on the right track
I'm dazed and confused
Is it stay, is it go?
I still love you
But I still want to know
Secrets are fun to a certain degree
This one's no fun cause the secret's on me
I'm dazed and confused
Is it stay, is it go?
I've been abused
And I sure wanna know
Give me a clue as to where I am at
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a catEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
