Only you can make all this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you
(One and only you)7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes!4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay
While I pray

My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

My prayer
Is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words
That I'm longing to know
My prayer
And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time
When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time
Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun
I count the moments darling
'Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Remember love notes, the teacher found in school
The whole class laughing, gee I felt just like a fool
But that's not the very part about I
I had to write 1 thousand times
That I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Girl, I love you 1 thousand times
The love notes I treasured, loving you was not a sin
Punishment was pleasure, whoo I'd do it all over again
I wrote, and I wrote, till my fingers got sore
But I had to write just a little bit more
Did you read my letters, it's been on my mind?
All that it said was girl I love you one thousand times
From them until this very same day
I still feel that same old wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm sorry for the things I've done
I know that I'm the foolish one
Now that I see who's to blame
I'm so ashamed, I'm sorry
I'm sorry for the things I've said
Just like a child I lost my head
I should have known from the start
I'd break your heart, I'm sorry
Please be kind and I know you'll find
It's so easy to forgive
Darling, wait for it's not too late
Give our love a chance to live
I know the heartaches you've been through
I know for I've had heartaches, too
There's nothing more I can do
But say to you "I'm sorry"
Please be kind and I know you'll find
It's so easy to forgive
Darling, wait for it's not too late
Give our love a chance to live, oh live
I know the heartaches you've been through
I know for I've had heartaches, too
There's nothing more I can do
But say to you----"I'm sorry"
(Darling, I'm truly sorry)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Living is a dream when you make it seem enchanted
Lovers take for granted all the world's aglow, they ought to know
When you touch a star then you really are enchanted
Find a seed and plant it, love will make it grow
It's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover
And thrill to the wonders of night
And days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover
Your dreams run to dreams in continuous flight
Love is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted
When your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes
It's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover
And thrill to the wonders of night
And days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover
Your dreams run to dreams in continuous flight
Love is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted
When your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Moonlight on the river Colorado
How I wish that I were there with you
As I sit and find each lonely, lonely shadow
Takes me back to days that we once knew
We were to wed in harvest time you said
That's why I'm longing for you
When it's moonlight on the Colorado
I wonder if you're waiting for me too
We were to wed in harvest time you said
That's why I'm longing for you
When it's moonlight on the river Colorado
I wonder if you're waiting for me tooEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when I looked to the moon it turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when I looked to the moon it turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my ownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
