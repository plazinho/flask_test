(Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)

We're a million miles apart in a thousand ways
Baby, you can light up the dark like a solar scape
And I can almost feel you coming and your heartbeat race
Someone, somebody, something, in the choice we make

Oh, we all got wanderlust in the darkest place
So we're going with our heart, yeah, it's all the rage
Oh, we're just, just tryin' to find ourselves in the storms we chase
Eh, eh, eh
Baby, in an endless summer, we can find our way

I, I think about you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah

No one wants to stay at home
Nobody wants to be alone
When you come knocking, I’ll be at your door
I don’t ever wanna stop
I’m gonna give it all I've got
And when they ask me, “Who could ask for more?”

Can’t stand still
I won’t slow down

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out dancing

This is where I wanna be with you
Your arms wrapped around me
And fireworks reflecting in your eyes
This is how I wanna feel
The wine, the kiss, the music real
And getting down, riding all the highs

Can’t stand still
I won’t slow down

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out dancing

Everybody’s got a story
Let it be your blaze of glory
Burning bright, never fade away
And when the final curtain falls, we could say we did it all
The never ending of a perfect day

Can’t stand still
(Can’t stand still)
I won’t slow down
(Won’t slow down)

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out
(I wanna go out dancing)
I wanna go out
I wanna go out
(I wanna go out dancing)
 
Spinning around, spinning around
Oh

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cause the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this (Ooh)

Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down (I'm not the same)
I'm not the same (I know you feel me)
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

Feel me 'cause you like it like this, oh
I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh
Ooh yeah, like it like this, like it like this
I'm not the same, like it like this
I'm not the same, I'm not the same, oh
 
Feel my heartbeat
It's the same old feeling coming over me tonight
Me tonight
Feel it buzzing
Said I'm never gonna call, but tonight, I think I might
Think I might

Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?

I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby

Major mistake
No, I never shoulda gone, baby, I was on thе run
On the run
It was heartbreak
I can't stand anothеr day knowing that you are the one
You're the one

Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?

I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves

But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body

Real groove, real groove

I feel like anything could happen
The stars look different tonight
They're glowin' all around me
It's flowin' through my body
I can feel it, I can feel it
Don't know if I'm awake or dreamin'
There must be somethin' in the air
The time is disappearin'
This moment's never leavin'
I can feel it, I can feel it

You got me started
Ain't nothin' on Earth can stop it
It's crazy, I'm fallin'
I don't know what else to call it
Oh, do you believe in magic?

Tomorrow don't matter
We'll make the night last forevеr
So do you believe in magic?
Do you, do you, do you?
Do you bеlieve in magic?
Ooh-ooh

Free fallin', it's a new emotion
I swear there's diamonds in your eyes
Come hold me like you mean it
Don't wanna keep this secret
Can you feel it? My heart beatin'
You make me wanna do these wild things
Your touch is supernatural
Ooh, I can't fight this feelin'
I'm floatin' through the ceilin'
Can you feel it? I can feel it, oh-oh

You got me started
Ain't nothin' on Earth can stop it
It's crazy, I'm fallin'
I don't know what else to call it
Oh, do you believe in magic?

Ooh-ooh
 
Thought that I was going crazy
Just having one of those days, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

Was tired of running out of luck
Thinking 'bout giving up, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one (Meant to be as one)
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

Everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
Love at first sight, love at first sight
Love, ooh, it was love, it was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one (Meant to be as one)
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
 
What on Earth am I meant to do?
In this crowded place, there is only you
Was gonna leave, now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

Ooh, is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in

Ooh, is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

(With you, with you, with you, with you)
Want to make it with you
(With you, with you, with you, with you)

Ooh, is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you (Wanna make it with you)
It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too (My heart is sinking, too)
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you (Wanna make it with you)
It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too
It's no surprise (No surprise, no surprise)
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you
It's in your eyes
 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you?
Take a chance tonight and try something new
You're getting boring, you're, oh, so boring
And I don't recognize the zombie you've turned into

Don't worry 'cause tonight, I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (You see)
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Ain't getting me back at the end of this song
Get outta my way, get outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way, way outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way

Now I got a taste, I wanna explore
Ain't going to waste, no, not anymore
You're going hard now, to win my heart
But too many times now, you've been coming up short

Don't worry 'cause tonight, I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (You see)
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Ain't getting me back at the end of this song
Get outta my way, get outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way, way outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way

No, I ain't going home 'cause I wanna stay
But I won't be alone no how, no way
Now I showed you what I'm made of made of
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Ain't getting me back at the end of this song
Get outta my way, get outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way, way outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way

No, I ain't going home
But I won't be alone
Now I showed you what I'm made of (Made of)
Now I showed you what I'm made of (Made of)
 
Somehow, we've always been together
But never got together
I never felt the pressure 'til now
There's something in the air
I'm here and you're just there
I can't pretend that I don't care

Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling

One risk from lying on your shoulder
When I was feeling colder
And now I can't get over
One kiss, a dangerous situation
I'm lost in hesitation
My heart's a little shaken

Yeah, one day, I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling
