No one wants to stay at home
Nobody wants to be alone
When you come knocking, I’ll be at your door
I don’t ever wanna stop
I’m gonna give it all I've got
And when they ask me, “Who could ask for more?”

Can’t stand still
I won’t slow down

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out dancing

This is where I wanna be with you
Your arms wrapped around me
And fireworks reflecting in your eyes
This is how I wanna feel
The wine, the kiss, the music real
And getting down, riding all the highs
Can’t stand still
I won’t slow down

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out dancing

Everybody’s got a story
Let it be your blaze of glory
Burning bright, never fade away
And when the final curtain falls, we could say we did it all
The never ending of a perfect day

Can’t stand still
(Can’t stand still)
I won’t slow down
(Won’t slow down)
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

Spinning around, spinning around
Oh

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cause the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this (Ooh)

Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down (I'm not the same)
I'm not the same (I know you feel me)
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
Feel me 'cause you like it like this, oh
I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh
Ooh yeah, like it like this, like it like this

Feel my heartbeat
It's the same old feeling coming over me tonight
Me tonight
Feel it buzzing
Said I'm never gonna call, but tonight, I think I might
Think I might

Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?

I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby

Major mistake
No, I never shoulda gone, baby, I was on thе run
On the run
It was heartbreak
I can't stand anothеr day knowing that you are the one
You're the one
Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?

Thought that I was going crazy
Just having one of those days, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

Was tired of running out of luck
Thinking 'bout giving up, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky

In this crowded place, there is only you
Was gonna leave, now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

Ooh, is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too
It's no surprise

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in

Take a chance tonight and try something new
You're getting boring, you're, oh, so boring

Somehow, we've always been together
But never got together
I never felt the pressure 'til now
There's something in the air
I'm here and you're just there
I can't pretend that I don't care

Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling
One risk from lying on your shoulder
When I was feeling colder
And now I can't get over
One kiss, a dangerous situation
I'm lost in hesitation
My heart's a little shaken

In my imagination
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind, a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine

In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
It's a crazy situation
You always keep me waiting
Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running
To give you all my loving
If one day, you would notice me

My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine
I'm dreaming
That you're in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

Every man who ever sees me wants to hold my hand
And be the one who gets me to say "Oh, I do"
They swear eternal undying devotion
Yes, they swear that they will love me forever love me true
But I don't need a shining star
And I don't want to be rescued
No neither front nor charming prince
Nor my summers barbecued

I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy

Free your mind
Free is the way to live it up
Free to go
Free, if I don't want to give it up
Free to groove
The dance floors where I want to be
Free to move
White picket fences frighten me
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, fella
Just chiggy-wiggy with you, baby

Ah, ah, don't want a talker
Ah, ah, don't need repartee
Ah, ah, don't need a future
I just like to party
Ah, ah, forget tomarow
Ah, my feeet are tapping
Ah, ah, why dont you get it?
Why won't you let it happen?
Say you'll never go never ever go
Down upon on your knees
Say you'll never say, never ever say
Baby, marry me, please

Your feet move just like a dancer
Your soul beats just like a drum
Tomorrow has all the answers
Today says we've just begun

Don't you feel the sun on your face?
Hopeful hearts of the human race
Shining down from above

We're golden
Burn like the stars
Stay golden
Straight from the heart
We're the voice that'll never give in
Getting knocked down, back up again
We're golden, golden
That's who we are

Live your life like you're stealing
Every little moment in time
Infinity goes on forever
Lay your life on the line
Don't you feel the sun on your face?
Hopeful hearts of the human race
Wrapped in the arms of love

We're golden
Burn like the stars
Stay golden
Straight from the heart
We're the voice that'll never give in
Getting knocked down, back up again
We're golden, golden
That's who we are

We're not young, and we're not old
We're the stories not yet told
Won't be bought and can't be sold
We are golden

We're golden
Burn like the stars
Stay golden
Straight from the heart
We're the voice that'll never give in
Getting knocked down, back up again
We're golden, golden
That's who we are5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Santa Baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby a 54 convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list

Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring - I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Especially for you
I wanna let you know what I was going through
All the time we were apart I thought of you
You were in my heart, my love never changed
I still feel the same

Especially for you
I wanna tell you I was feeling that way too
And if dreams were wings, you know
I would have flown to you
To be where you are, no matter how far
And now that I'm next to you
No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've gotta say it's all because of you

And now we're back together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you

Especially for you
I wanna tell you, you mean all the world to me
How I'm certain that our love was meant to be
You changed my life, you showed me the way
And now that I'm next to you
I've waited long enough to find you
I wanna put all the hurt behind you
Oh, and I wanna bring out all the love inside you, oh
And now we're back together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you

You were in my heart, my love never changed
No more dreaming about tomorrow
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow
I've gotta say, it's all because of you

And now we're back together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you
Together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for you
Together, together
I wanna show you my heart is oh so true
And all the love I have is especially for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(You kiss me, you touch me)

Don't say it's like a fantasy
When you know this is how it should be

You kiss me, I'm falling
Can you hear me calling?

I wanna stay forever, stay forever
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Now I'm getting closer to you
Hold me, I just can't be without you

It's your name I'm calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you
On a night like this
I wanna stay forever, stay forever
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Seems I've known you a lifetime (Lifetime)
Now it's time to make you mine
On a night like this
On a night like this, oh
(You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me)
On a night like this, just wanna be together
