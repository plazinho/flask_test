Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra
 
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?


And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
 
Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

I know I've felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be

Ah
La ya
La la ya
La-ah-ah

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
They'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

And now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh, my life
Is changing every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me

Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
 
Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it
Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
 
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hold onto love
That is what I do
Now that I've found you
And from above
Everything's stinking
They're not around you
And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you
And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you
But I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hold onto my hands
I feel I'm sinking
Sinking without you
And to my mind
Everything's stinking
Stinking without you
And miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hey, baby
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hey, baby
 
Suddenly, something has happened to me
As I was having my cup of tea
Suddenly, I was feeling depressed
I was utterly and totally stressed
Do you know you made me cry? (Woah-oh)
Do you know you made me die?

And the thing that gets to me (Thing that gets to me)
Is you'll never really see (Is you'll never really see)
And the thing that freaks me out (The thing that freaks me out)
Is I'll always be in doubt (Always be in doubt)

It is a lovely thing that we have
It is a lovely thing that we
It is a lovely thing
The animal
The animal instinct
(Whoo-huu-hu, whoo-huu-hu, whoo-huu-hu-uhh)

So take my hands and come with me
We will change reality
So take my hands and we will pray
They won't take you away
They will never make me cry, no (Oh)
They will never make me die

And the thing that gets to me (Thing that gets to me)
Is you'll never really see (Is you'll never really see)
And the thing that freaks me out (The thing that freaks me out)
Is I'll always be in doubt (Always be in doubt)

The animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
The animal, the animal, the animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it's the animal, it's the animal instinct in me
 
There's no need to argue anymore
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore
And the thing that makes me mad
Is the one thing that I had
I knew, I knew
I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
Special to me, to me
And I remember all the things we once shared
Watching T.V. movies on the living room armchair
But they say it will work out fine
Was it all a waste of time
Cause I knew, I knew
I'd lose you
You'll always be special to me
Special to me, to me
Will I forget in time, ah
You said I was on your mind?
There's no need to argue
No need to argue anymore
There's no need to argue anymore
 
There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
Stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were livin' for the love we had
Livin' not for reality

Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was

That was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Never be said that I'd be unstable

Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was

There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be livin' for the love we have
Livin' not for reality

It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination, it was
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination, it was

Not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my
Not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my
Laa, la-la-la, laa, la-la-la-laa
Laa, la-la-la, laa, la-la-la-laa

My imagination, my imagination
My imagination, my imagination (Not my imagination, not my imagination)
My imagination, my imagination (Not my imagination)

You'd better believe I'm comin'
You'd better believe what I say
You'd better hold on to your promises
Because you bet, you'll get what you deserve
She's going to leave him over
She's gonna take her love away
So much for your eternal vows
Well, it does not matter anyway

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke

Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do

What of all the things that you taught me?
What of all the things that you'd say?
What of all your prophetic preaching?
You're just throwing it all away
Maybe we should burn the house down
Have ourselves another fight
Leave the cobwebs in the closet
'Cause tearing them out is just not right

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me, oh-oh

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)

To all those people doing lines
Don't do it, don't do it
Inject your soul with liberty
It's free, it's free
To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
Because it's not, not what it seems
No, no it's not, not what it seems
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free

To all those parents with sleepless nights
Sleepless nights
Tie your kids home to their beds
Clean their heads
To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
Because it's not, not what it seems
No, no it's not, not what it seems

Twister, oh, does anyone see through you?
You're a twister, oh, an animal
But you're so happy, how?
I didn't go along with
You're so happy how?
Na-na-na-na
But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
Hold on, hold on
Or we're gonna have to move on
We're gonna have to move on
Or we're gonna have to move on
Move on, move on
I feel alright
And I cried so hard the
Ridiculous thoughts, a-ha how
I feel alright, alright, alright, alright
Twister, oh, I shouldn't have trusted in you
Twister, oh, a-na-na-na
It's not gonna happen now
You're not gonna make fun of me
Happen now, a-na-na-na
But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
Hold on, hold on
Or we're gonna have to move on

Ridiculous thoughts, a-ha how
We should have lied, a lied, a lied, a lied

Well, you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on, to me
 
Lying in my bed again
And I cry cause you're not here
Crying in my head again
And I know that it's not clear
Put your hands, put your hands
Inside my face and see that it's just you
But it's bad and it's mad
And it's making me sad
Because I can't be with you

Be with you, be with you
Be with you, be with you
Be with you, be with you
Baby, I can't be with you

Thinking back on how things were
And on how we loved so well
I wanted to be the mother of your child
And now it's just farewell
Put your hands in my hands
And come with me
We'll find another end
And my head, and my head
On anyone's shoulder
'Cause I can't be with you

Be with you, be with you
Be with you, be with you
Be with you, be with you
Baby, I can't be with you

'Cause you're not here, you're not here
Baby, I can't be with you
'Cause you're not here, you're not here
Baby, still in love with you

Still in love with you
When I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
When I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
When I'm still in love with you
 
Something has left my life
And I don't know where it went to
Somebody caused me strife
And it's not what I was seeking
Didn't you see me? Didn't you hear me?
Didn't you see me standing there?
Why did you turn out the lights?
Did you know that I was sleeping?
Say a prayer for me
Help me to feel the strength I did
My identity, has it been taken?
Is my heart breakin' on me?
All my plans fell through my hands;
They fell through my hands, on me
All my dreams, it suddenly seems, it suddenly seems
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
 
All the things you said to me today
Changed my perspective in every way
These things count to mean so much to me
Into my faith you and your baby
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
Dreaming my dreams with you
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
Dreaming my dreams with you
('Dreaming My Dreams' was written on
December 25th 1993. New fevril happiness
Dedicated to my husband, lover
Best friend, support
What more can be said?)
 
Holdin' on
That's what I do, since I met you
And it won't be long
Would you notice, if I left you?
And it's fine for some
Cause you're not the one, you're not the one
There
There, there, there...
There, there
All night long, laid on my pillow
These things are wrong
I can't sleep here
So lovely
So lovely
So lovely
I have decided to leave you forever
I have decided to start things from here
Thunder and lightning won't change what I'm feelin'
And the daffodils look lovely today...
And the daffodils look lovely today...
Look lovely today
Through your eyes I can see the disguise
Through your eyes I can see the dismay
Has anyone seen lightning?
Has anyone, looked lovely?
And the daffodils look lovely today...
And the daffodils look lovely today...
Look lovely today
Look lovely (look lovely)

I'm not ready for this
Though I thought I would be
I can't see the future
Though I thought I could see

I don't want to leave you
Even though I have to
I don't want to love you
Oh, I still do

Need some time to find myself
You wouldn't live with it
Can I go my own way?
Can I pray my own way?
I don't want to leave you
Oh, I need you

Am I ready for this?
Did I think I would be?
Can I see the future?
No, I can't see
I don't want to leave you
Even though I have to
I don't want to love you
Oh, I still do

Ah
Ah
Oh I still do
Ah
Ah
Oh I still do
Ah
Oh
 
I don't think it's going to happen anymore
You took my thoughts from me, now I want nothing more
And did you think you could just take it all away
I don't think it's happening, this is what I say
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Cause I found it all
Twenty One

So I don't think it's going to happen anymore

Are you found?

Do you remember, remember the night?
At a hotel in London, they started to fight
She told her man that she fell on the ground
She was afraid that the truth would be found

Do you remember?
Do you recall?
Do you remember?
I remember it all

And it's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now


Do you remember, remember the place?
In a hotel in London, a scar on her face
She told her man that she fell on the ground
She was afraid that the truth would be found

Do you remember
Do you recall?
Do you remember?
'Cause I remember it all

And it's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now


It's all over now

Silenced by death in the grave
William Butler Yeats couldn't save
Why did you stand here
Were you sickened in time
But I know by now
Why did you sit here
In the grave
Why should I blame her
That she filled my days
With misery or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways
Or hurled the little streets upon the great
Had they but courage equal to desire?
Sad that Maud Gonne couldn't stay
But she had MacBride anyway
And you sit here with me
On the isle Innisfree
And you are writing down everything
But I know by now
Why did you sit here
In the grave...
Why should I blame her
Had they but courage equal to desire
