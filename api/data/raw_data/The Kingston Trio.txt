(Spoken Introduction:)
These are the times that try men's souls
In the course of our nation's history
The people of Boston have rallied bravely
Whenever the rights of men have been threatened
Today a new crisis has arisen
The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better known as the MTA
Is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population
In the form of a subway fare increase
Citizens, hear me out, this could happen to you!
(Song:)
Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie
On a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family
Went to ride on the MTA
Well, did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned
(What a pity)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
And he's the man who never returned
Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station
And he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there the conductor told him, "One more nickel"
Charlie couldn't get off of that train!
But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned
(Poor old Charlie)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
Now, all night long Charlie rides through the stations
Crying, "What will become of me?
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea
Or my cousin in Roxbury?"
But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned
(Shame and scandal)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station
Every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
As the train comes rumbling through!
But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned
(He may ride forever)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
Pick it Davey
(Kinda hurts my fingers)
Now, you citizens of Boston
Don't you think it's a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Brian!
Get poor Charlie off the MTA!
Or else he'll never return
No he'll never return and his fate is still unlearned
(Just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
He's the man who never returned
He's the man who never returned
He's the man who never returned
Et tu, Charlie?

Throughout history, there have been many songs written about the eternal triangle. This next one tells the story of Mister Grayson, a beautiful woman and a condemned man named Tom Dooley. When the sun rises tomorrow, Tom Dooley must hang
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
I met her on the mountain
There I took her life
Met her on the mountain
Stabbed her with my knife
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
This time tomorrow
Reckon where I'll be
Hadn't-a been for Grayson
I'd-a been in Tennessee
Well now, boy
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Hang down your head and try, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head and try, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
This time tomorrow
Reckon where I'll be
Down in some lonesome valley
Hangin' from a white oak tree
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Well now, boy
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Poor boy, you're bound to die
Poor boy, you're bound to dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We lay my love and I beneath the weeping willow
But now alone I lie and weep beside the tree
Singing "Oh willow waly" by the tree that weeps with me
Singing "Oh willow waly" till my lover return to me
We lay my love and I beneath the weeping willow
A broken heart have I. Oh willow I die, oh willow I dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Scotch and Soda
Mud in yer eye
Baby do I feel high oh me oh my
Do I feel high
Dry martini
Jigger of gin
Oh what a spell you've got me in, oh my
Do I feel high
People won't believe me
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do
And still be on the wagon
All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eye oh me oh my
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' baby I feel high
People won't believe me
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do
And still be on the wagon
All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eye oh me oh my
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' baby I feel highEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night (drinkin' all night)
Got into a fight (got into a fight)
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home (I want to go home, so now)

Hoist up the John B's sails
See how the main sails set
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home (let me go home)
Let me go home (I want to go home)
I wanna go home (why don't you let me go home?)
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home (I want to go home)

First mate, he got drunk
Broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone (Sheriff John Stone)
Why don't you leave me alone? (why don't you leave me alone?)
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home (I want to go home, so now)
Hoist up the John B's sails
See how the main sails set
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home (let me go home)
Let me go home (I want to go home)
I wanna go home (why don't you let me go home?)
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home (I want to go home)

Well, the poor cook he caught the fits
Throw away all of my grits
Then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home (I want to go home)
I wanna go home (why don't you let me go home?)
This is the worst trip
Since I've been born (since I have been born, so now)

Hoist up the John B's sails
See how the main sails set
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home (let me go home)
Let me go home (I want to go home)
I wanna go home (why don't you let me go home?)
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home (I want to go home, so now)
Hoist up the John B's sails (John B's sails)
See how the main sails set (main sails set)
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home (let me go home)
Let me go home (I want to go home)
I wanna go home (why don't you let me go home?)
Well, I feel so break up
I wanna go home (I want to go home)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Some people say I'm a no-count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural born travellin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
When I was a little baby
My momma said, "Hey son
Travel where you will and grow to be a man
And sing what must be sung, poor boy
Sing what must be sung."
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
Now that I'm a grown man
I've travelled here and there
I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song
The only ones who ever cared, poor boy
The only ones who ever cared
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
Some people say I'm a no-count
Others say I'm no good
But I'm just a natural born travellin' man
Doin' what I think I should, oh yeah
Doin' what I think I should
And I don't give a damn about a Greenback a-dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailing song and a good guitar
The only things that I understand, poor boy
The only things that I understand
The only things that I understand, poor boy

They're rioting in Africa
They're starving in Spain
There's hurricanes in Florida and Texas needs rain
The whole world is festering with unhappy souls
The French hate the Germans
The Germans hate the Poles
Italians hate Yugoslavs
South Africans hate the Dutch
And I don't like anybody very much!
But we can be tranquil and thankful and proud
For man's been endowed with a mushroom shaped cloud
And we know for certain that some lovely day
Someone will set the spark off and we will all be blown away
They're rioting in Africa
There's strife in Iran
What nature doesn't do to us will be done by our fellow manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I started on a journey, about a year ago
To a little town called Morrow in the State of Ohio
I've never been much of a traveler, and I really didn't know
That Morrow was the hardest place I'd ever try to go
So I went down to the station for my ticket and applied
For tips regarding Morrow, not expecting to be guyed
Said I, "My friend, I'd like to go to Morrow and return
No later than tomorrow, for I haven't time to burn."
Said he to me, "Now let me see if I have heard you right
You'd like to go to Morrow and return tomorrow night
You should have gone to Morrow yesterday and back today
For the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way
"If you had gone to Morrow yesterday now don't you see
You could have gone to Morrow and returned today at three
For the train today to Morrow, if the schedule is right
Today it goes to Morrow and returns tomorrow night."
Said I, "My friend, it seems to me you're talking through your hat
There is a town named Morrow on the line now tell me that."
"There is," said he, "but take from me a quiet little tip
To go from here to Morrow is a 14 hour trip
"The train today to Morrow leaves today at 8:35
At half-past ten tomorrow is the time it should arrive
So if from here to Morrow is a fourteen hour jump
Can you go today to Morrow and get back today, you chump?"
Said I, "I'd like to go to Morrow, so can I go today
And get to Morrow by tonight if there is no delay?"
"Well, well," said he to me, "and I've got no more to say
Can't get anywhere tomorrow and get back again today."
Said I, "I guess you know it all, but kindly let me say
How can I get to Morrow if I leave this town today?"
Said he, "You cannot go to Morrow any more today
'Cause the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way."
I was so disappointed, I was mad enough to swear
The train had gone to Morrow and had left me standing there
That man was right in telling me that I was a howling jay
I could not go to Morrow so I guess in town I'll stayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
'Tis advertised in Boston, New York, and Buffalo a hundred hearty sailors, a whalin' for to go."
Blow, ye winds, O' mornin', blow, ye winds, hi ho. Haul away your runnin' gear and blow, boys, blow
They tell you of the clipper ships a-runnin' in and out. They say you'll take five hundred whales before you're six months out
Blow, ye winds, O' mornin', blow, ye winds, hi ho. Haul away your runnin' gear and blow, boys, blow
The skipper's on the after deck a-squintin' at the sails. When up above the lookout spots a mighty school of whales
Blow, ye winds, O' mornin', blow, ye winds, hi ho. Haul away your runnin' gear and blow, boys, blow
Then lower down the boats, my boys, and after him we'll travel but if you get too near his tail, he'll kick you to the devil
Blow, ye winds, O' mornin', blow, ye winds, hi ho. Haul away your runnin' gear and blow, boys, blow
And now that he is ours, my boys, we'll bring him alongside. Then over with our blubber hooks and rob him of his hide
Blow, ye winds, O' mornin', blow, ye winds, hi ho. Haul away your runnin' gear and blow, boys, blow
When we get home, our ship made fast, and we get through our sailin'. A brimmin' glass around we'll pass and hang this blubber whalin'
Blow, ye winds, O' mornin', blow, ye winds, hi ho. Haul away your runnin' gear and blow, boys, blowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine, when you gonna let me get sober. LEAVE me alone. Let me go home. Let me go HOME and start over
Well, I've rambled around this dirty old town singing for nickels and dimes
Times getting' rough. I can't get enough to buy me a little bottle of wine
Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine, when you gonna let me get sober. LEAVE me alone. Let me go home. Let me go HOME and start over
Well, little hotel, older than hell, cold as the dark in the mine
Light so dim, I had to grin, I got me a little bottle of wine
Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine, when you gonna let me get sober. LEAVE me alone. Let me go home. Let me go HOME and start over
Well, the preacher will preach and the teacher will teach. The miner will dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God, huggin' my little bottle of wine
Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine, when you gonna let me get sober. LEAVE me alone. Let me go home. Let me go HOME and start over
Well, pain in my head, bugs in my bed, pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, I tell the people I meet to buy me a little bottle of wine
Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine, when you gonna let me get sober. LEAVE me alone. Let me go home. Let me go HOME and start over
Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine, when you gonna let me get soberEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
