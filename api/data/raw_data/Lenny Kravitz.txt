Here we are still together
We are one
So much time wasted
Playing games with love

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But, baby, it ain't over until it's over

How many times
Did we give up?
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
Kept me wondering, yeah
If I'd always, always be in love

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
But, baby, it ain't over until it's over

So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
'Cause, baby, it ain't over until it's over
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But, baby, it ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive

I was born long ago
I am the chosen I'm the one
I have come to save the day
And I won't leave until I'm done
So that's why you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way ?
And I got to, got to know

I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way ?
And I got to, got to know
Are you going to go my way?
Because baby I got to know, yeah5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Until you cried, never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
At every time I've always known
That you were there
Upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you
My love forever


All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

You are the flame in my heart
You light my way in the dark, you are the ultimate star
You lift me up from above
Your unconditional love takes me to paradise

I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet

You make me feel so divine
Your soul and mind are entwined before you I was blind
But since I've opened my eyes
And with you there's no disguise, so I could open up my mind
I always loved you from the start
But I could not figure out, that I had to do it everyday
So I put away the fight
Now I'm going to live my life, giving you the most in every way

I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
I belong to you
And you... you belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where's the love we had?
When did it go bad?
Or am I just insecure?
I give all I can
Baby I'm your man
Tell me what you're in this for
Remind me

I can't go on
I know not what to do
My heart is worn
I feel as If I'm through
Please believe in me
'Cause what I need is for you
To believe in me

Countless sleepless nights
Never ending fights
I'm trying to make your dreams come true
I will sacrifice to find paradise
But I need to know that you're behind me

45 caliber in the face
Shot him in the head because of his race
Now that he is dead, will we plead his case?
While the executioner's out on grace

I just thought somehow that things would get better

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
And the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

What's that going down in the Middle East?
Do you really think it's to keep the peace
How we love to control a foreign land
Taking all we can is always the plan

And they know, they know that Africa is the center
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
And the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough

When will the desire for love outweigh the desire for power?
When will we face the truth and allow our hearts to flower?
For the planet, for the people
For every living thing upon this world, yeah
For destruction and the hatred (oh, the hatred)
Is about to take us down for good

What's in all those trails, up there, in the sky?
Why has all the food become modified?
Pushing all your drugs just to keep us high
While the media propagates the lie

And I know, oh yes, I know (I know) the all-seeing eye is the Devil
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
And the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
And the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
And the system, you cannot trust
It's enough, it's enough
When the whole wide world is corrupt
It's enough, it's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough, it's enough, hoo

We are living in these times
Where The Evil One has come to rob us blind, oh yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, ​people, we must understand
That it's time to wake up and do what we can, oh yeah-yeah-yeah

Life is just a lonely highway
I'm out here on the open road
I'm old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul
I don't want to lose you baby
And I don't want to be alone
Don't want to live my days without you
But for now I've got to be without you

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But then I think of loving
And I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...

Babe, can't you see
That this is killing me?
I don't want to push you baby
And I don't want you to be told
It's just that I can't breathe without you
Feel like I'm going to lose control

I've got a pocket full of money
And pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But when it comes to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...
Am I a fool to think that there's a little hope
Yeah yeahhhhhheee yeah
Tell me baby, yeah
What are the rules the reasons and the do's and don'ts
Yeah yeahhhhhheee yeah
Tell me baby tell me baby, yeah
What do you feel inside?

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
Oh yeah
But when it comes down to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...
I just can't get you off of my mind
