Mustard on the beat, ho!

I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh, you needed me

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Stay
I want you to stay

Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night

Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe

I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

Get no piece
Get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace
