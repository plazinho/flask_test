tell that the empty quivered brown skinned indian on the bank that were crowded and narrow held a broken arrow eighteen year of american dream he saw that his brother had sworn on the wall he hung up his eyelid and ran down the hall his mother had told him a trip wa a fall and don t mention baby at all did you see him did you see him did you see him in the river he wa there to wave to you could you tell that the empty quivered brown skinned indian on the bank that were crowded and narrow held a broken arrow the street were lined for the wedding parade the queen wore the white glove the county of song the black covered caisson her horse had drawn protected her king from the sun ray of dawn they married for peace and were gone did you see them did you see them did you see them in the

my eye closed i went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blow now i won t be back till later on if i do come back at all but you know me and i miss you now in a strange game i saw myself a you

finally broke away from school and became a musician i thought well now i may have a little bit of a chance because all i really wanted to do is music and not only play music but compose music at that time in germany in they had already discotheque so i would take my car would go to a discotheque sing maybe thirty minute i think i had about seven eight song i would partially sleep in the car because i didn t want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two year to survive in the beginning i wanted to do an album with the sound of the s the sound of the s of the s and then have a sound of the future and i said wait a second i know the synthesizer why don t i use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future and i didn t have any idea what to do but i knew i needed a click so we put a click on the track which then wa synced to the moog modular i knew that could be a sound of the future but i didn t realize how much the impact would be my name is giovanni giorgio but

                "Death Cab for Cutie": "love of mine someday you will die but i ll be close behind i ll follow you into the dark no blinding light or tunnel to gate of white just our hand clasped so tight waiting for the hint of a spark if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied illuminate the no s on their vacancy sign if there s no one beside you when your soul embarks then i ll follow you into the dark in catholic school a vicious a roman rule i got my knuckle bruised by a lady in black and i held my tongue a she told me son fear is the heart of love so i never went back if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied illuminate the no s on their vacancy sign if there s no one beside you when your soul embarks then i ll follow you into the dark you and me have seen everything to see from bangkok to calgary and the sol of your shoe are all worn down the time for sleep is now it s nothing to cry about cause we ll hold each other soon in the blackest of room and if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied and illuminate the no s on their vacancy sign if there s no one beside you when your soul embarks then i ll follow you into the dark then i ll follow you into the dark the atlantic wa born today and i ll tell you how the cloud above opened up and let it out i wa standing on the surface of a perforated sphere when the water filled every hole and thousand upon thousand made an ocean making island where no island should go oh no most people were overjoyed they took to their boat i thought it le like a lake and more like a moat the rhythm of my footstep crossing flatlands to your door have been silenced forevermore the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row it seems farther than ever before oh no i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you

come on and it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to father time a i stared at my shoe in the icu that reeked of piss and and i rationed my breath a i said to myself that i d already taken too much today a each descending peak on the lcd took you a little farther away from me away from me amongst the vending machine and year old magazine in a place where we only say goodbye it stung like a violent wind that our memory depend on a faulty camera in our mind and i knew that you were truth i would rather lose than to have never lain beside at all and i looked around at all the eye on the ground a the tv entertained itself cause there s no comfort in the waiting room just nervous pace bracing for bad news and then the nurse come round and everyone lift their head but i m thinking of what sarah said that love is watching someone die so who s gonna watch you die so who s gonna watch you die so who s gonna watch you die i want to live where soul meet body and let the sun wrap it arm around me and bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feel feel what it s like to be new cause in my head there s a greyhound station where i send my thought to far off destination so they may have a chance of finding a place where they re far more suited than here and i cannot guess what we ll discover when we turn the dirt with our palm cupped like shovel but i know our filthy hand can wash one another s and not one speck will remain and i do believe it s true that there are road left in both of our shoe but if the silence take you then i hope it take me too so brown eye i ll hold you near cause you re the only song i want to hear a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere where soul meet body where soul meet body where soul meet body and i do believe it s true that there are road left in both of our shoe but if the silence take you then i hope it take me too so brown eye i ll hold you near cause you re the only song i want to hear a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere gold rush digging for gold in my neighborhood

there is mine there is a desert veiled in pavement and there s a city of seven hill all our debris flow to the ocean to meet again i hope it will how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you there is an answer in a question and there is hope within despair and there is beauty in a failure and there are depth beyond compare there is a role of a lifetime and there s a song yet to be sung and there s a dumpster in the driveway of all the plan that came undone how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you there is whiskey in the water and there is death upon the vine and there is grace within forgiveness but it s so hard for me to find how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you and when i see you i really see you upside down but my brain know better it pick you up and turn you around turn you around turn you around if you feel discouraged that there s a lack of color here please don t worry lover it s really bursting at the seam from absorbing everything the spectrum a to z this is fact not fiction for the first time in year all the girl in every girly magazine can t make me feel any le alone i m reaching for the phone to call at and on your machine i slur a plea for you to come home but i know it s too late i should have given you a reason to stay given you a reason to stay given you a reason to stay given you a reason to stay this is fact not fiction for the first time in year this is the moment that you know that you told her that you loved her but you don t you touch her skin and then you think that she is beautiful but she don t mean a thing to me yeah she is beautiful but she don t mean a thing to me i spent two week in silver lake the california sun cascading down my face there wa a girl with light brown streak and she wa beautiful but she didn t mean a thing to me yeah she wa beautiful but she didn t mean a thing to me i wanted to believe in all the word that i wa speaking a we moved together in the dark and all the friend that i wa telling all the playful misspelling and every bite i gave that left a mark when tiny vessel oozed into your neck and formed the bruise that you said you didn t want to fade but they did and so did i that day and all i see are dark grey cloud in the distance moving closer with every hour so when you ask is something wrong i think you re damn right there is but we can t talk about it now no we can t talk about it now so one last touch and then you ll go and we ll pretend that it meant something so much more but it wa vile and it wa cheap and you are beautiful but you don t mean a thing to me yeah you are beautiful but you don t mean a thing to me yeah you are beautiful but you don t mean a thing to me i roll the window down and then begin to breathe in the darkest country road and the strong scent of evergreen from the passenger seat a you are driving me home then looking upwards i strain my eye and try to tell the difference between shooting star and satellite from the passenger seat a you are driving me home do they collide i ask and you smile with my foot on the dash the world doesn t matter when you feel embarrassed then i ll be your pride when you need direction then i ll be the guide for all time for all time if only you had known me before the accident for with that grand collision came a grave consequence receptor overloaded they burst and disconnect til there wa little feeling please work with what is left oh i need not be flattered that you ve never been here before so there s no need to mention that you ve no first anymore but if you let me be your skyline i ll let you be the wave that reduces me to rubble but looked safe from far away i don t know why i don t know why i return to the scene of these crime where the hedgerow slowly wind through the ghost of beverly drive i don t know why i don t know why i don t know what i expect to find where all the news is secondhand and everything just go on

to the great divide seeking a place to stand or a place to hide down in the crowded bar out for a good time can t wait to tell you all what it s like up there and they called it paradise i don t know why somebody laid the mountain low while the town got high then the chilly wind blew down across the desert through the canyon of the coast to the malibu where the pretty people play hungry for power to light their neon way and give them thing to do some rich men came and raped the land nobody caught them put up a bunch of ugly box and jesus people bought them and they called it paradise the place to be they watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea you can leave it all behind and sail to lahaina just like the missionary did so many year ago they even brought a neon sign jesus is coming brought the white man s burden down brought the white man s reign who will provide the grand design what is yours and what is mine because there is no more new frontier we have got to make it here we satisfy our endless need and justify our bloody deed in the name of destiny and in the name of god and you can see them there on sunday morning stand up and sing about what it s like up there they call it

apart again love love will tear u apart again why is the bedroom so cold you ve turned away on your side is my timing that flawed our respect run so dry yet there s still this appeal that we ve kept through our life but love love will tear u apart again love love will tear u apart again you cry out in your sleep all my failing exposed there s a taste in my mouth a desperation take hold just that something so good just can t function no more then love love will tear u apart again love love will tear u apart again then love love will tear it apart again love love will tear it apart again i ve been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand could these sensation make me feel the pleasure of a normal man lose sensation spare the insult leave them for another day i ve got the spirit

of style a change of scene with no regret a chance to watch admire the distance still occupied though you forget different colour different shade over each mistake were made i took the blame directionless so plain to see a loaded gun won t set you free so you say we ll share a drink and step outside an angry voice and one who cried we ll give you everything and more the strain s too much can t take much more oh i ve walked on water run through fire can t seem to feel it anymore it wa me waiting for me hoping for something more me seeing me this time hoping for something else to the centre of the city where all road meet waiting for you to the depth of the ocean where all hope sank searching for you i wa moving through the silence without motion waiting for you in a room with a window in the corner i found truth in the shadowplay acting out your own death knowing no more a the assassin all grouped in four line dancing on the floor and with cold steel odour on their body made a move to connect but i could only stare in disbelief a the crowd all left i did everything everything i wanted to i let them use you for their own end to the centre of the city in the night waiting for you to the centre of the city in the night waiting for you confusion in her eye that say it all she s lost control and she s clinging to the nearest passer by she s lost control and she gave away the secret of her past and said i ve lost control again and a voice that told her when and where to act she said i ve lost control again and she turned around and took me by the hand and said i ve lost control again and how i ll never know just why or understand she said i ve lost control again and she screamed out kicking on her side and said i ve lost control again and seized up on the floor i thought she d die she said i ve lost control she s lost control again she s lost control she s lost control again she s lost control well i had to phone her friend to state my case and say she s lost control again and she showed up all the error and mistake and said i ve lost control again but she expressed herself in many different way until she lost control again and walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed i ve lost control she s lost control again she s lost control she s lost control again she s lost control in fear every day every evening he call her aloud from above carefully watched for a reason painstaking devotion and love surrendered to self preservation from others who care for themselves a blindness that touch perfection but hurt just like anything else isolation isolation isolation mother i tried please believe me i m doing the best that i can i m ashamed of the thing i ve been put through i m ashamed of the person i am isolation isolation isolation but if

right i m not afraid anymore i keep my eye on the door but i remember tear of sadness for you more upheaval for you reflects a moment in time a special moment in time yeah we wasted our time we didn t

creeping up slowly the last fatal hour oh i don t know what made me what gave me the right to mess with your value and change wrong to right please keep your distance the trail lead to here there s blood on your finger brought on by fear i campaigned for nothing i worked hard for this i tried to get to you you treat me like this it s just second nature it s what we ve been shown we re living by

understood a cynical demeanor but one of u misread what do you know it happened again a friend is not a mean you utilize to get somewhere somehow i didn t notice friendship is an end what do you know it happened again how come no one told me all throughout history the loneliest people were the one who always spoke the truth the one who made a difference by withstanding the indifference i guess it s up to me now should i take that risk or just smile what do you know it happened again what do you know riding on this know how never been here before peculiarly entrusted possibly that s all is history recorded doe someone have a tape surely i m no pioneer constellation stay the same just a little bit of danger when intriguingly our little secret trust that you trust me cause no one will ever know that this wa happening so tell me why you listen when nobody s talking what is there to know all this is what it is you and me alone sheer simplicity i ll lose some sale and my bos won t be happy but i can t stop listening to the sound of two soft voice blended in perfection from the reel of this record that i ve found every day there s a boy in the mirror asking me what are you doing here finding all my previous motif growing increasingly unclear i ve traveled far and i ve burned all the bridge i believed a soon a i hit land all the other option held before me would wither in the light of my plan so i ll lose some sale and my bos won t be happy but there s only one thing on my mind searching box underneath the counter on a chance that on a tape i d find a song for someone who need somewhere to long for homesick because i no longer know where home is hey baby mr cold acting so tough didn t know you had it in you to be hurt at all you waited too long you should ve hooked me before i put my raincoat on okay i get it okay i see you were frantic because you knew you d find yourself vulnerable around me okay i get it okay i see you feel vulnerable around me hey baby what s going on you lost control and you lost your tongue you lost me deaf in my ear nothing you can say is gonna change the way i feel okay i get it okay i see you were frantic because you knew you d find yourself vulnerable around me okay i get it okay i see i step too close to your boundary you wanted nobody around to see you feel vulnerable around me hey baby what is love it wa just a game we re

circle place look the same and we re the only difference the wind is in your hair it s covering my view i m holding on to you on a bike we ve hired until tomorrow if only they could see if only they had been here they would understand how someone could have chosen to go the length i ve gone to spend just one day riding holding on to you i never thought it would be this clear i d rather dance with you than talk with you so why don t we just move into the other room there s space for u to shake and hey i like this tune even if i could hear what you said i doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear because i haven t read a single book all year and the only film i saw i didn t like it at all i d rather dance i d rather dance than talk with you i d rather dance i d rather dance than talk with you i d rather dance i d rather dance than talk with you the music s too loud and the noise from the crowd increase the chance of misinterpretation so let your hip do the talking i ll make

through winter brave enough to go traveling around the world without money to eat or sleep for seeing what you can do with your hand and foot i feel there is no question about it almost anything you can imagine almost any goal you will get there i wish you had been more of a talker not the kind that is just flapping his lip and not the kind that look away but learns through his eye when som\u0435body is watching maybe you could have told me th\u0435re wa a world on your shoulder that needed lifting maybe i could have helped you with that the weight is not easy i know but you never know i thought your shoe were good i thought they would take you to the end of any road i thought your back wa strong but i should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail carried you to the top of the rocky trail i should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail how am i to know about your problem and your load i am blind to what you show i am waiting to be told i never ask how am i to

if you squint a little more it look the same but ooooooooooooooooooooooooh there s a little bit of me inside you gathering what you ve lost but oooooooooooooooooooooooooh there s a little bit of you in everyone can never keep a secret problem line on your face you smooth them out so no one can tell put a straight back upon a stage could dance dance hide the tremor in your hand but ooooooooooooooooooooooooh there s a little bit of me inside you gathering what you ve lost but oooooooooooooooooooooooooh there s a little bit of you in everyone and i m watching you now i see you

watching you now i see you building the castle with one hand while tearing down another with the other you set yourself above that all forgiving god you claim that you believe in your kind is gonna fall your ship is sinking fast and all your able men are leaving only someone who s morally superior can possibly and honestly deserve to rule my world i talk before i think you shoot before you know who s in your line of fire so somehow we re the same we re causing people pain but i stand and take the blame you scramble to deny only someone who s morally superior can possibly and honestly deserve

my kind of town cause they don t need the kind of law and order that tends to keep a good man underground a sad old soldier once told me a story about a battlefield that he wa on he said a man should never fight for glory he must know what is right and what is wrong now i don t know how much i owe my uncle but i suspect it s more than i can pay he s asking me to sign a three year contract i guess i ll catch the first bus out today yes you loved me and you sold my clothes i love you but that s the way that it go so it go yes you know how i feel so it go it just couldn t be real and we know it s

be real and you want me home all night you just don t want another fight but you better love find some love love me baby jesus christ i wa walking down the street the other day and a sight came before my eye it wa a little hippie boy i must have been twice his size his appearence typified his strange breed gaudy clothes long stringy hair hanging down i d seen perhaps a thousand in my early trip to town a he walked beside me on down the block i noticed no unpleasing smell he might have been on the weed or even lsd but if he wa i couldn t tell so we walked together that way through this neighborhood finally he turned around to me and he said friend you know we re a million mile apart but you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather so why don t we put our difference aside and just talk to each other you see this box beneath my arm to you it s plain it ha no charm but to someone dearest to my heart this box ha played a tragic part this little one can t tell you himself about his life and how he died but if anyone else could speak for him i guess i m qualified this boy wa in chicago he didn t know why he wa there he wa with his family and friend and he didn t really care you might have been one of those who saw the struggle there on your television screen the tragic thing is so much else happened that no one else could have seen a stranger handed this boy a dollar to do a simple chore to carry a package to a nearby hotel and when he returned he d get two more but when he came back he sort of lost his way walking thru the crowd one of them thing you ask yourself how the lord allowed but when he wa found he wa like he is now dreaming sweet and still and in his little hand wa a crumpled dollar bill now you can take that dollar get four cent on it compound it quarterly at any downtown bank so they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb well what i m going to tell you now you can stay or you can leave you kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing it s the same for any hippie bum or hillbilly out on the street just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat now could you help u sing this song please there will be peace in the valley for him now we pray i will think of the little hippie boy that way at the dark end of the street that s where we ll always meet hiding in shadow where we don t belong living in darkness to hide our wrong you and me at the dark end of the street you and me i know that time s gonna take it toll we ll have to pay for the love that we stole cause it s a sin and we know that we re wrong oh but our love keep coming on strong you and me at the dark end of the street you and me they re gonna find u they re gonna find u they re gonna find u someday we ll steal away to the dark end of the street you and me if you take a walk downtown and find some time to look around if you should see me and i walk on by oh darling please don t cry tonight we ll meet at the dark end of the street you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me
