play guitar i definitely wanted to become a musician it wa almost impossible because it wa the dream wa so big that i didn t see any chance because i wa living in a little town wa studying and when i finally broke away from school and became a musician i thought well now i may have a little bit of a chance because all i really wanted to do is music and not only play music but compose music at that time in germany in they had already discotheque so i would take my car would go to a discotheque sing maybe thirty minute i think i had about seven eight song i would partially sleep in the car because i didn t want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two year to survive in the beginning i wanted to do an album with the sound of the s the sound of the s of the s and then have a sound of the future and i said wait a second i know the synthesizer why don t i use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future and i didn t have any idea what to do but i knew i needed a click so we put a click on the track which then wa synced to the moog modular i knew that could be a sound of the future but i didn t realize how much the impact would be my name is giovanni giorgio but everybody call me giorgio once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct you can do whatever you want so nobody told me what to do and there wa no preconception of what to do there are so many thing that i don t understand there s a world within me that i cannot explain many room to explore but the door look the same i am lost i can t even remember my name i ve been

                "Death Cab for Cutie": "love of mine someday you will die but i ll be close behind i ll follow you into the dark no blinding light or tunnel to gate of white just our hand clasped so tight waiting for the hint of a spark if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied illuminate the no s on their vacancy sign if there s no one beside you when your soul embarks then i ll follow you into the dark in catholic school a vicious a roman rule i got my knuckle bruised by a lady in black and i held my tongue a she told me son fear is the heart of love so i never went back if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied illuminate the no s on their vacancy sign if there s no one beside you when your soul embarks then i ll follow you into the dark you and me have seen everything to see from bangkok to calgary and the sol of your shoe are all worn down the time for sleep is now it s nothing to cry about cause we ll hold each other soon in the blackest of room and if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied and illuminate the no s on their vacancy sign if there s no one beside you when your soul embarks then i ll follow you into the dark then i ll follow you into the dark the atlantic wa born today and i ll tell you how the cloud above opened up and let it out i wa standing on the surface of a perforated sphere when the water filled every hole and thousand upon thousand made an ocean making island where no island should go oh no most people were overjoyed they took to their boat i thought it le like a lake and more like a moat the rhythm of my footstep crossing flatlands to your door have been silenced forevermore the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row it seems farther than ever before oh no i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer i need you so much closer so come on come on so come on come on so come on come on so come on come on so come on come on so come on come on and it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to father time a i stared at my shoe in the icu that reeked of piss and and i rationed my breath a i said to myself that i d already taken too much today a each descending peak on the lcd took you a little farther away from me away from me amongst the vending machine and year old magazine in a place where we only say goodbye it stung like a violent wind that our memory depend on a faulty camera in our mind and i knew that you were truth i would rather lose than to have never lain beside at all and i looked around at all the eye on the ground a the tv entertained itself cause there s no comfort in the waiting room just nervous pace bracing for bad news and then the nurse come round and everyone lift their head but i m thinking of what sarah said that love is watching someone die so who s gonna watch you die so who s gonna watch you die so who s gonna watch you die i want to live where soul meet body and let the sun wrap it arm around me and bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feel feel what it s like to be new cause in my head there s a greyhound station where i send my thought to far off destination so they may have a chance of finding a place where they re far more suited than here and i cannot guess what we ll discover when we turn the dirt with our palm cupped like shovel but i know our filthy hand can wash one another s and not one speck will remain and i do believe it s true that there are road left in both of our shoe but if the silence take you then i hope it take me too so brown eye i ll hold you near cause you re the only song i want to hear a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere where soul meet body where soul meet body where soul meet body and i do believe it s true that there are road left in both of our shoe but if the silence take you then i hope it take me too so brown eye i ll hold you near cause you re the only song i want to hear a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere gold rush digging for gold in my neighborhood

there is mine there is a desert veiled in pavement and there s a city of seven hill all our debris flow to the ocean to meet again i hope it will how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you there is an answer in a question and there is hope within despair and there is beauty in a failure and there are depth beyond compare there is a role of a lifetime and there s a song yet to be sung and there s a dumpster in the driveway of all the plan that came undone how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you there is whiskey in the water and there is death upon the vine and there is grace within forgiveness but it s so hard for me to find how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you how could something so fair be so cruel when this black sun revolved around you and when i see you i really see you upside down but my brain know better it pick you up and turn you around turn you around turn you around if you feel discouraged that there s a lack of color here please don t worry lover it s really bursting at the seam from absorbing everything the spectrum a to z this is fact not fiction for the first time in year all the girl in every girly magazine can t make me feel any le alone i m reaching for the phone to call at and on your machine i slur a plea for you to come home but i know it s too late i should have given you a reason to stay given you a reason to stay given you a reason to stay given you a reason to stay this is fact not fiction for the first time in year this is the moment that you know that you told her that you loved her but you don t you touch her skin and then you think that she is beautiful but she don t mean a thing to me yeah she is beautiful but she don t mean a thing to me i spent two week in silver lake the california sun cascading down my face there wa a girl with light brown streak and she wa beautiful but she didn t mean a thing to me yeah she wa beautiful but she didn t mean a thing to me i wanted to believe in all the word that i wa speaking a we moved together in the dark and all the friend that i wa telling all the playful misspelling and every bite i gave that left a mark when tiny vessel oozed into your neck and formed the bruise that you said you didn t want to fade but they did and so did i that day and all i see are dark grey cloud in the distance moving closer with every hour so when you ask is something wrong i think you re damn right there is but we can t talk about it now no we can t talk about it now so one last touch and then you ll go and we ll pretend that it meant something so much more but it wa vile and it wa cheap and you are beautiful but you don t mean a thing to me yeah you are beautiful but you don t mean a thing to me yeah you are beautiful but you don t mean a thing to me i roll the window down and then begin to breathe in the darkest country road and the strong scent of evergreen from the passenger seat a you are driving me home then looking upwards i strain my eye and try to tell the difference between shooting star and satellite from the passenger seat a you are driving me home do they collide i ask and you smile with my foot on the dash the world doesn t matter when you feel embarrassed then i ll be your pride when you need direction then i ll be the guide for all time for all time if only you had known me before the accident for with that grand collision came a grave consequence receptor overloaded they burst and disconnect til there wa little feeling please work with what is left oh i need not be flattered that you ve never been here before so there s no need to mention that you ve no first anymore but if you let me be your skyline i ll let you be the wave that reduces me to rubble but looked safe from far away i don t know why i don t know why i return to the scene of these crime where the hedgerow slowly wind through the ghost of beverly drive i don t know why i don t know why i don t know what i expect to find where all the news is secondhand and everything just go on a planned you wanna teach but not be taught and i wanna sell but not be bought so let u not be lonesome so let u not be lonesome lost in between our need and want our need and want i don t know why i don t know why i return to the scene of these crime where the hedgerow slowly wind through the ghost of beverly drive i don t know why i don t know why i don t know what i expect to find where all the news is secondhand and everything just go on a planned i don t know why i don t know why i don t know why i don t know why i don t know why i don t know why i don t know why i don t know why you may tire of me a our december sun is setting cause i m not who i used to be no longer easy on the eye but these wrinkle masterfully disguise the youthful boy below who turned your way and saw something he wa not looking for both a beginning and an end but now he life inside someone he doe not recognize when he catch his reflection on accident on the back of a motorbike with your arm outstretched trying to take flight leaving everything behind but even at our swiftest speed we couldn t break from the concrete in the city where we still reside and i have learned that even landlocked lover yearn for the sea like navy men cause now we say goodnight from our own separate side like brother on a hotel bed like brother on a hotel bed like brother on a hotel bed like brother on a hotel bed you may tire of me a our december sun is setting cause i m not who i used to be the glove compartment is inaccurately named and everybody know it so i m proposing a swift orderly change because behind it door there s nothing to keep my finger warm and all i find are souvenir from better time before the gleam of your taillight fading east to find yourself a better life i wa searching for some legal document a the rain beat down on the hood when i stumbled upon picture i tried to forget and that s how this idea wa drilled into my head cause it s too important to stay the way it s been but there s no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that it s gone it s like it wasn t there at all and here i rest where disappointment and regret collide lying awake at night and there s no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that it s gone it s like it wasn t there at all and here i rest where disappointment and regret collide lying awake at night up all night when i m lying awake at night i dreamt we spoke i dreamt we spoke again it d been so long it d been so long my mind filled in the blank i dreamt we spoke i dreamt we spoke again it d been so long it d been so long your voice wa like a ghost in my head in my head only in yes only in a dream is anything is anything the way it used to be i dreamt we spoke i dreamt we spoke again but when i awoke when i awoke i could not remember anything you said anything you said anything you said anything you said it wa degree a we sat beneath a willow tree whose tear didn t care they just hung in the air and refused to fall to fall and i knew i d made a horrible call and now the state line felt like the berlin wall and there wa no doubt about which side i wa on mhm cause i built you a home in my heart with rotten wood and it decayed from the start cause you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along no you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along i braved treacherous street and kid strung out on homemade speed and we shared a bed in which i could not sleep at all woohoo woohoo ooh cause at night the sun in retreat made the skyline look like crooked teeth in the mouth of a man who wa devouring u both you re so cute when you re slurring your speech but they re closing the bar and they want u to leave and you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along no you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along i m a war of head versus heart and it s always this way my head is weak and my heart always speaks before i know what it will say and you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along no you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along no you can t find nothing at all if there wa nothing there all along there were church theme park and mall but there wa nothing there all along how i wish you could see the potential the potential of you and me it s like a book elegantly bound but in a language that you can t read just yet you gotta spend some time love you gotta spend some time with me and i know that you ll find love i will posse your heart you gotta spend some time love you gotta spend some time with me and i know that you ll find love i will posse your heart there are day when outside your window i see my reflection a i slowly pas and i long for this mirrored perspective when we ll be lover lover

to the great divide seeking a place to stand or a place to hide down in the crowded bar out for a good time can t wait to tell you all what it s like up there and they called it paradise i don t know why somebody laid the mountain low while the town got high then the chilly wind blew down across the desert through the canyon of the coast to the malibu where the pretty people play hungry for power to light their neon way and give them thing to do some rich men came and raped the land nobody caught them put up a bunch of ugly box and jesus people bought them and they called it paradise the place to be they watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea you can leave it all behind and sail to lahaina just like the missionary did so many year ago they even brought a neon sign jesus is coming brought the white man s burden down brought the white man s reign who will provide the grand design what is yours and what is mine because there is no more new frontier we have got to make it here we satisfy our endless need and justify our bloody deed in the name of destiny and in the name of god and you can see them there on sunday morning stand up and sing about what it s like up there they call it paradise i don t know why you call someplace paradise kiss it goodbye all alone at the end of the evening when the bright light have faded to blue i wa thinking bout a woman who might have loved me and i never knew you know i ve always been a dreamer spent my life running round and it s so hard to change can t seem to settle down but the dream i ve seen lately keep on turning out and burning out

through our life but love love will tear u apart again love love will tear u apart again you cry out in your sleep all my failing exposed there s a taste in my mouth a desperation take hold just that something so good just can t function no more then love love will tear u apart again love love will tear u apart again then love love will tear it apart again love love will tear it apart again i ve been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand could these sensation make me feel the pleasure of a normal man lose sensation spare the insult leave them for another day i ve got the spirit lose the feeling take the shock away it s getting faster moving faster now it s getting out of hand on the tenth floor down the back stair into no man s land light are flashing car are crashing

of style a change of scene with no regret a chance to watch admire the distance still occupied though you forget different colour different shade over each mistake were made i took the blame directionless so plain to see a loaded gun won t set you free so you say we ll share a drink and step outside an angry voice and one who cried we ll give you everything and more the strain s too much can t take much more oh i ve walked on water run through fire can t seem to feel it anymore it wa me waiting for me hoping for something more me seeing me this time hoping for something else to the centre of the city where all road meet waiting for you to the depth of the ocean where all hope sank searching for you i wa moving through the silence without motion waiting for you in a room with a window in the corner i found truth in the shadowplay acting out your own death knowing no more a the assassin all grouped in four line dancing on the floor and with cold steel odour on their body made a move to connect but i could only stare in disbelief a the crowd all left i did everything everything i wanted to i let them use you for their own end to the centre of the city in the night waiting for you to the centre of the city in the night waiting for you confusion in her eye that say it all she s lost control and she s clinging to the nearest passer by she s lost control and she gave away the secret of her past and said i ve lost control again and a voice that told her when and where to act she said i ve lost control again and she turned around and took me by the hand and said i ve lost control again and how i ll never know just why or understand she said i ve lost control again and she screamed out kicking on her side and said i ve lost control again and seized up on the floor i thought she d die she said i ve lost control she s lost control again she s lost control she s lost control again she s lost control well i had to phone her friend to state my case and say she s lost control again and she showed up all the error and mistake and said i ve lost control again but she expressed herself in many different way until she lost control again and walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed i ve lost control she s lost control again she s lost control she s lost control again she s lost control in fear every day every evening he call her aloud from above carefully watched for a reason painstaking devotion and love surrendered to self preservation from others who care for themselves a blindness that touch perfection but hurt just like anything else isolation isolation isolation mother i tried please believe me i m doing the best that i can i m ashamed of the thing i ve been put through i m ashamed of the person i am isolation isolation isolation but if you could just see the beauty these thing i could never describe these pleasure a wayward distraction this is my one lucky prize isolation isolation isolation isolation isolation this is the room the start of it all no portrait so fine only sheet on the wall i ve seen the night filled with bloodsport and pain and the body obtained the body obtained where will it end where will it end where will it end where will it end these are your friend from childhood through youth who goaded you on demanded more proof withdrawal pain is hard it can do you right in so distorted and thin distorted and thin where will it end where will it end where will it end where will it end this is the car at the edge of the road there s nothing disturbed all the window are closed i guess you were right when we talked in the heat there s no room for the weak no room for the weak where will it end where will it end where will it end where will it end this is the room the start of it all through childhood through youth i remember it all oh i ve seen the night filled with bloodsport and pain and the body obtained the body obtained the body obtained where will it end where will it end where will it end

illusion worn like a mask of self hate confronts and then dy don t walk away people like you find it easy naked to see walking on air hunting by the river through the street every corner abandoned too soon set down with due care don t walk away in silence don t walk away guess your dream always end they don t rise up just descend but i don t care anymore i ve lost the will to want more i m not afraid not at all i watch them all a they fall but i remember when we were young those with habit of waste their sense of style and good taste of making sure you were right hey don t you know you were right i m not afraid anymore i keep my eye on the door but i remember tear of sadness for you more upheaval for you reflects a moment in time a special moment in time yeah we wasted our time we didn t really have time but we remember when we were young and all god s angel beware and all you judge beware son of chance take good care for all the people not there i m not afraid anymore i m not afraid anymore i m not afraid anymore oh i m not afraid anymore forced by the pressure the territory marked no longer the pleasure oh i ve since lost the heart corrupted from memory no longer the power it s creeping up slowly the last fatal hour oh i don t know what made me what gave me the right to mess with your value and change wrong to right please keep your distance the trail lead to here there s blood on your finger brought on by fear i campaigned for nothing i worked hard for this i tried to get to you you treat me like this it s just second nature it s what we ve been shown we re living by your rule that s all that we know i tried to get to you i tried to get to you i tried to get to you oh i tried to get to radio live transmission radio live transmission listen to the silence let it ring on eye dark grey lens frightened of the sun we would have a fine time living in the night left to blind destruction waiting for our sight and we would go on a though nothing wa wrong and hide

the best term i can the past is now part of my future the present is well out of hand the present is well out of hand heart and soul one will burn heart and soul one will burn one will burn one will burn heart and soul one will burn here are the young men the weight on their shoulder here are the young men well where have they been we knocked on the door of hell s darker chamber pushed to the limit we dragged ourselves in watched from the wing a the scene were replaying we saw ourselves now a we never had seen portrayal of the trauma and degeneration the sorrow we suffered and never were free where have they been where have they been where have they been where have they been weary inside now our heart s lost forever can t replace the fear or the thrill of the chase each ritual showed up the door for our wandering open then shut then slammed in our face where have they been where have they been where have they been where have they been so this is permanence love s shattered pride what once wa innocence turned on it side a cloud hang over me mark every move deep in the memory of what once wa love oh how i realised how i wanted time put into perspective tried so hard to find just for one moment thought i d found my way destiny unfolded i watched it slip away excessive flash point beyond all reach solitary demand for all i d like to keep let s take a ride out see what we can find a valueless collection of hope and past desire i never realised the length i d have to go all the darkest corner of a sense i didn t know just for one moment i heard somebody call looked beyond the day in hand there s nothing there at all now that i ve realised how it s all gone wrong gotta find some therapy this treatment take too long deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway gotta find my destiny before it get too late",

understood a cynical demeanor but one of u misread what do you know it happened again a friend is not a mean you utilize to get somewhere somehow i didn t notice friendship is an end what do you know it happened again how come no one told me all throughout history the loneliest people were the one who always spoke the truth the one who made a difference by withstanding the indifference i guess it s up to me now should i take that risk or just smile what do you know it happened again what do you know riding on this know how never been here before peculiarly entrusted possibly that s all is history recorded doe someone have a tape surely i m no pioneer constellation stay the same just a little bit of danger when intriguingly our little secret trust that you trust me cause no one will ever know that this wa happening so tell me why you listen when nobody s talking what is there to know all this is what it is you and me alone sheer simplicity i ll lose some sale and my bos won t be happy but i can t stop listening to the sound of two soft voice blended in perfection from the reel of this record that i ve found every day there s a boy in the mirror asking me what are you doing here finding all my previous motif growing increasingly unclear i ve traveled far and i ve burned all the bridge i believed a soon a i hit land all the other option held before me would wither in the light of my plan so i ll lose some sale and my bos won t be happy but there s only one thing on my mind searching box underneath the counter on a chance that on a tape i d find a song for someone who need somewhere to long for homesick because i no longer know where home is hey baby mr cold acting so tough didn t know you had it in you to be hurt at all you waited too long you should ve hooked me before i put my raincoat on okay i get it okay i see you were frantic because you knew you d find yourself vulnerable around me okay i get it okay i see you feel vulnerable around me hey baby what s going on you lost control and you lost your tongue you lost me deaf in my ear nothing you can say is gonna change the way i feel okay i get it okay i see you were frantic because you knew you d find yourself vulnerable around me okay i get it okay i see i step too close to your boundary you wanted nobody around to see you feel vulnerable around me hey baby what is love it wa just a game we re

cool off in the shadow then into the street following the water there s a bearded man paddling in his canoe look a if he ha come all the way from the cayman island these canal it seems they all go in circle place look the same and we re the only difference the wind is in your hair it s covering my view i m holding on to you on a bike we ve hired until tomorrow if only they could see if only they had been here they would understand how someone could have chosen to go the length i ve gone to spend just one day riding holding on to you i never thought it would be this clear i d rather dance with you than talk with you so why don t we just move into the other room there s space for u to shake and hey i like this tune even if i could hear what you said i doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear because i haven t read a single book all year and the only film i saw i didn t like it at all i d rather dance i d rather dance than talk with you i d rather dance i d rather dance than talk with you i d rather dance i d rather dance than talk with you the music s too loud and the noise from the crowd increase the chance of misinterpretation so let your hip do the talking i ll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings and you ll make me smile by really getting into the swing getting into the swing getting into the swing getting into the swing getting into the swing one

through winter brave enough to go traveling around the world without money to eat or sleep for seeing what you can do with your hand and foot i feel there is no question about it almost anything you can imagine almost any goal you will get there i wish you had been more of a talker not the kind that is just flapping his lip and not the kind that look away but learns through his eye when som\u0435body is watching maybe you could have told me th\u0435re wa a world on your shoulder that needed lifting maybe i could have helped you with that the weight is not easy i know but you never know i thought your shoe were good i thought they would take you to the end of any road i thought your back wa strong but i should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail carried you to the top of the rocky trail i should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail how am i to know about your problem and your load i am blind to what you show i am waiting to be told i never ask how am i to

watching you now i see you building the castle with one hand while tearing down another with the other you set yourself above that all forgiving god you claim that you believe in your kind is gonna fall your ship is sinking fast and all your able men are leaving only someone who s morally superior can possibly and honestly deserve to rule my world i talk before i think you shoot before you know who s in your line of fire so somehow we re the same we re causing people pain but i stand and take the blame you scramble to deny only someone who s morally superior can possibly and honestly deserve only someone who s morally superior can possibly and honestly deserve to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world to rule my world explain me one more time when they kill it s a crime when you kill it is justice what s the immaterial substance that envelope two that one perceives a hunger and the other a food i awake in tangled cover to a sash of snow you dream in a cartoon garden i could never know innocent imitation of how it would be if when the music entered you did not retreat in

care leave but don t leave me look around and choose your own ground for long you live and high you fly and smile you ll give and tear you ll cry and all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be run rabbit run dig that hole forget the sun and when at last the work is done don t sit down it s time to dig another one for long you live and high you fly but only if you ride the tide and balanced on the biggest wave you race towards an early grave remember when you were young you shone like the sun shine on you crazy diamond now there s a look in your eye like black hole in the sky shine on you crazy diamond you were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom blown on the steel breeze come on you target for faraway laughter come on you stranger you legend you martyr and shine you reached for the secret too soon you cried for the moon shine on you crazy diamond threatened by shadow at night and exposed in the light shine on shine on you crazy diamond you crazy diamond well you wore out your welcome with random precision rode on the steel breeze come on you raver you seer of vision come on you painter you piper you prisoner and shine hey you out there in the cold getting lonely getting old can you feel me hey you standing in the aisle with itchy foot and fading smile can you feel me hey you don t help them to bury the light don t give in without a fight hey you out there on your own sitting naked by the phone would you touch me hey you with your ear against the wall waiting for someone to call out could you touch me hey you would you help me to carry the stone open your heart i m coming home but it wa only fantasy the wall wa too high a you can see no matter how he tried he could not break free and the worm ate into his brain hey you out there on the road always doing what you re told can you help me hey you out there beyond the wall breaking bottle in the hall can you help me hey you don t tell me there s no hope at all together we stand divided we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall u u u u u u and them them them them them and after all we re only ordinary men me me me me me me and you you you you you you god only know it s not what we would choose to do forward he cried from the rear and the front rank died the general sat and the line on the map moved from side to side black black black black black and blue blue blue blue blue and who know which is which and who is who up up up up up up and down down down down down and in the end it s only round and round and round haven t you heard it s a battle of word the poster bearer cried listen son said the man with the gun there s room for you inside i mean they re not gonna kill ya so like if you give em a quick short sharp shock they won t do it again dig it i mean he got off lightly cause i would ve given him a thrashing i only hit him once it wa only a difference of opinion but really i mean good manner don t cost nothing do they eh down down down down down and out out out out out it can t be helped but there s a lot of it about with with with with with without and who ll deny it s what the fighting s all about out of the way it s a busy day i ve got thing on my mind for want of the price of tea and a slice the old man died overhead the albatross hang motionless upon the air and deep beneath the rolling wave in labyrinth of coral cave the echo of a distant time come willowing across the sand and everything is green and submarine and no one showed u to the land and no one know the wheres or why but something stir and something try and start to climb towards the light stranger passing in the street by chance two separate glance meet and i am you and what i see is me and do i take you by the hand and lead you through the land and help me understand the best i can and no one call u to move on and no one force down our eye no one speaks and no one try no one fly around the sun cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eye inviting and inciting me to rise and through the window in the wall come streaming in on sunlight wing a million bright ambassador of morning and no one sings me lullaby and no one make me close my eye so i throw the window wide and call to you across the sky you got to be crazy you gotta have a real need you gotta sleep on your toe and when you re on the street you got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eye closed and then moving in silently down wind and out of sight you got to strike when the moment is right without thinking and after a while you can work on point for style like the club tie and the firm handshake a certain look in the eye and an easy smile you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to so that when they turn their back on you you ll get the chance to put the knife in you gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder you know it s going to get harder and harder and harder a you get older yeah and in the end you ll pack up and fly down south hide your head in the sand just another sad old man all alone and dying of cancer and when you lose control you ll reap the harvest you have sown and a the fear grows the bad blood slows and turn to stone and it s too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around so have a good drown a you go down all alone dragged down by the stone stone stone stone got to admit that i m a little bit confused sometimes it seems to me a if i m just being used gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise if i don t stand my own ground how can i find my way out of this maze deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending that everyone s expendable and no one ha a real friend and it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner everything s done under the sun but you believe at heart everyone s a killer who wa born in a house full of pain who wa trained not to spit in the fan who wa told what to do by the man who wa broken by trained personnel who wa fitted with collar and chain who wa given a pat on the back who wa breaking away from the pack who wa only a stranger at home who wa ground down in the end who wa found dead on the phone who wa dragged down by the stone who wa dragged down by the stone mother do you think they ll drop the bomb mother do you think they ll like this song mother do you think they ll try to break my ball ooh ah mother should

hand he s gone to the temple of the king far from the circle at the edge of the world he s hoping wondering thinking back on the story he s heard of what he s going to see there in the middle of a circle it lie heaven help me then all could see by the shine in his eye the answer had been found back with the people in the circle he stand giving feeling with just one touch of a strong right hand

with trembling hand i read the questionnaire it asked me question about my mama and papa now that ain t what i call exactly fair so i m heading for the nearest foreign border vancouver might be just my kind of town cause they don t need the kind of law and order that tends to keep a good man underground a sad old soldier once told me a story about a battlefield that he wa on he said a man should never fight for glory he must know what is right and what is wrong now i don t know how much i owe my uncle but i suspect it s more than i can pay he s asking me to sign a three year contract i guess i ll catch the first bus out today yes you loved me and you sold my clothes i love you but that s the way that it go so it go yes you know how i feel so it go it just couldn t be real and we know it s wrong and i don t think it s gonna go on when i come home carrying my shoe i ve been waiting to tell you some news and you want me home all night and you don t want another fight but you better love find some love you better love me jesus christ yes you loved me and you sold all my clothes i love you baby but that s the way that it go so it go i guess you know how i feel so it go yes it couldn t be real and you want me home all night you just don t want another fight but you better love find some love love me baby jesus christ i wa walking down the street the other day and a sight came before my eye it wa a little hippie boy i must have been twice his size his appearence typified his strange breed gaudy clothes long stringy hair hanging down i d seen perhaps a thousand in my early trip to town a he walked beside me on down the block i noticed no unpleasing smell he might have been on the weed or even lsd but if he wa i couldn t tell so we walked together that way through this neighborhood finally he turned around to me and he said friend you know we re a million mile apart but you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather so why don t we put our difference aside and just talk to each other you see this box beneath my arm to you it s plain it ha no charm but to someone dearest to my heart this box ha played a tragic part this little one can t tell you himself about his life and how he died but if anyone else could speak for him i guess i m qualified this boy wa in chicago he didn t know why he wa there he wa with his family and friend and he didn t really care you might have been one of those who saw the struggle there on your television screen the tragic thing is so much else happened that no one else could have seen a stranger handed this boy a dollar to do a simple chore to carry a package to a nearby hotel and when he returned he d get two more but when he came back he sort of lost his way walking thru the crowd one of them thing you ask yourself how the lord allowed but when he wa found he wa like he is now dreaming sweet and still and in his little hand wa a crumpled dollar bill now you can take that dollar get four cent on it compound it quarterly at any downtown bank so they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb well what i m going to tell you now you can stay or you can leave you kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing it s the same for any hippie bum or hillbilly out on the street just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat now could you help u sing this song please there will be peace in the valley for him now we pray i will think of the little hippie boy that way at the dark end of the street that s where we ll always meet hiding in shadow where we don t belong living in darkness to hide our wrong you and me at the dark end of the street you and me i know that time s gonna take it toll we ll have to pay for the love that we stole cause it s a sin and we know that we re wrong oh but our love keep coming on strong you and me at the dark end of the street you and me they re gonna find u they re gonna find u they re gonna find u someday we ll steal away to the dark end of the street you and me if you take a walk downtown and find some time to look around if you should see me and i walk on by oh darling please don t cry tonight we ll meet at the dark end of the street you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me you and me

it sideways i said i couldn t hit it sideways oh just like now just like i said oh just like am ph ph ph ph ph ph phetamines waldo jeffers had reached his limit it wa now mid august which meant he had been separated from marsha for more than two month two month and all he had to show wa three dog eared letter and two very expensive long distance phone call true when school had ended and she d returned to wisconsin and he to locust pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity she would date occasionally but merely a amusement she would remain faithful but lately waldo had begun to worry he had trouble sleeping at night and when he did he had horrible dream he lay awake at night tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector tear welling in his eye a he pictured marsha her sworn vow overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some neanderthal finally submitting to the final caress of sexual oblivion it wa more than the human mind could bear vision of marsha s faithlessness haunted him daytime fantasy of sexual abandon permeated his thought and the thing wa they wouldn t understand how she really wa he waldo alone understood this he had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche he had made her smile she needed him and he wasn t there awww the idea came to him on the thursday before the mummer parade wa scheduled to appear he d just finished mowing and edging the edelsons lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there wa at least a word from marsha there wa nothing but a circular from the amalgamated aluminum company of america inquiring into his awning need at least they cared enough to write it wa a new york company you could go anywhere in the mail then it struck him he didn t have enough money to go to wisconsin in the accepted fashion true but why not mail himself it wa absurdly simple he would ship himself parcel post special delivery the next day waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment he bought masking tape a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build he judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably a few air hole some water perhaps some midnight snack and it would probably be a good a going tourist by friday afternoon waldo wa set he wa thoroughly packed and the post office had agreed to pick him up at three o clock he d marked the package fragile and a he sat curled up inside resting on the foam rubber cushioning he d thoughtfully included he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on marsha s face a she opened her door saw the package tipped the deliverer and then opened it to see her waldo finally there in person she would kiss him and then maybe they could see a movie if he d only thought of this before suddenly rough hand gripped his package and he felt himself borne up he landed with a thud in a truck and wa off marsha bronson had just finished setting her hair it had been a very rough weekend she had to remember not to drink like that bill had been nice about it though after it wa over he d said he still respected her and after all it wa certainly the way of nature and even though no he didn t love her he did feel an affection for her and after all they were grown adult oh what bill could teach waldo but that seemed many year ago sheila klein her very very best friend walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen oh gawd it s absolutely maudlin outside ach i know what you mean i feel all icky marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge sheila ran her finger over some salt grain on the kitchen table licked her finger and made a face i m supposed to be taking these salt pill but she wrinkled her nose they make me feel like throwing up marsha started to pat herself under the chin an exercise she d seen on television god don t even talk about that she got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamin want one supposed to be better than steak and then attempted to touch her knee i don t think i ll ever touch a daiquiri again she gave up and sat down this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone maybe bill ll call she said to sheila s glance sheila nibbled on a cuticle after last night i thought maybe you d be through with him i know what you mean my god he wa like an octopus hand all over the place she gestured raising her arm upwards in defense the thing is after a while you get tired of fighting with him you know and after all i didn t really do anything friday and saturday so i kind of owed it to him you know what i mean she started to scratch sheila wa giggling with her hand over her mouth i ll tell you i felt the same way and even after a while here she bent forward in a whisper i wanted to now she wa laughing very loudly it wa at this point that mr jameson of the clarence darrow post office rang the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house when marsha bronson opened the door he helped her carry the package in he had his yellow and his green slip of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that marsha had gotten out of her mother s small beige pocketbook in the den what do you think it is sheila asked marsha stood with her arm folded behind her back she stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room i dunno inside the package waldo quivered with excitement a he listened to the muffled voice sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton why don t you look at the return address and see who it s from waldo felt his heart beating he could feel the vibrating footstep it would be soon marsha walked around the carton and read the ink scratched label ah god it s from waldo that schmuck said sheila waldo trembled with expectation well you might a well open it said sheila both of them tried to lift the staple flap ah sst said marsha groaning he must have nailed it shut they tugged on the flap again my god you need a power drill to get this thing open they pulled again you can t get a grip they both stood still breathing heavily why don t you get a scissor said sheila marsha ran into the kitchen but all she could find wa a little sewing scissor then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tool in the basement she ran downstairs and when she came back up she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand this is the best i could find she wa very out of breath here you do it i i m gonna die she sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap but the blade wa too big and there wasn t enough room god damn this thing she said feeling very exasperated then smiling i got an idea what said marsha just watch said sheila touching her finger to her head inside the package waldo wa so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe his skin felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart beating in his throat it would be soon sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package then she sank down to her knee grasped the cutter by both handle took a deep breath and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package through the masking tape through the cardboard through the cushioning and thud right through the center of waldo jeffers head which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arc of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun",

all that i knew wa the hole in my shoe which wa letting in water letting in water i walked through a field that just wasn t real with tin soldier would shoot at my shoulder and all that i knew wa the hole in my shoe that wa letting in water letting in water i climbed on the back of a giant albatross which flew through a crack in the cloud to a place where happiness reigned all year round and music played ever so loudly i started to fall and suddenly woke and the dew on the grass had stuck to my coat and all that i knew wa the hole in my shoe that wa letting in water letting in water sometimes i feel like i m fading away you re looking at me i ve got nothing to say don t make me angry with the game that you play either light up or leave me alone walk in my room you lie on my bed open your mouth shoot someone dead all of a sudden you re inside my head either light up or leave me alone spending my bread like it grew on a tree you re trying to tell me bout the bird and the bee the skirt that you re wearing is way past your knee either light up or leave me alone you re up all night preaching your mind come home in the morning with your latest find i m gonna have to lay it to you straight on the line either light up or leave me alone i m looking for a girl who ha no face she ha no name or number and so i search within his lonely place knowing that i won t find her well i can t stop this feeling deep in inside me ruling my mind i feel no sound don t know where i m bound the scenery is all the same to me nothing ha changed or faded i m a part of it some part of me painted cool green and shaded so try to find myself must be the only way to feel free struggling with confusion disillusionment too can turn a man into a shadow cry out from pain through his nightmare vision he see nothing only well blind with the beggar s mind he s but a stranger he s but a stranger to himself suspended from a rope inside a bucket down a hole his hand are torn and bloodied from the scratching at his soul x like a hurricane around your heart when earth and sky are torn apart he come gathering up the bit while hoping that the puzzle fit he lead you he lead you freedom rider with a silver star between his eye that open up at hidden lie big man cry with defeat see people gathering in the street you feel him you feel him freedom rider when lightning strike you to the bone you turn around you re all alone by the time you hear that siren sound then your soul is in the lost and found forever forever freedom rider here it come once again i m northward bound on the edge of sea and

thousand headman couldn t make me change my mind if i had to take the choice between the deafman and the blind i know just where my foot should go and that s enough for me i turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea hadn t traveled very far when suddenly i saw three small ship a sailing out towards a distant shore so lighting up a cigarette i followed in pursuit and found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot filling up my pocket even stuffed it up my nose i must have weighed a hundred ton between my head and toe i ventured forth before the dawn had time to change it mind and soaring high above the cloud i found a golden shrine laying down my treasure before the iron gate quickly rang the bell hoping i hadn t come too late but someone came along and

til i knock the wind out of his sail and we don t make eye contact when we have run in in town just a barely polite nod and nervous stare towards the ground i once joined a priest class plastic inert slow danced with commerce like a lens up a skirt and we liked to party and we kept it live and we had a three volume tome of contemporary slang to keep a handle on all this jive ennui unbridled let s talk to kill the time how many style did you cycle through before you were mine and it s been a while since we went wild and that s all fine but we re sleepwalking through this trial and it s really a crime it s really a crime it s really a crime it s really criminal we re busy tempting like fate s on the nod running on empty bourbon and god it s been a while though since we knew the way and it s been even longer since our plastic priest class had a goddamned thing to say i wa a lover before this war i wa a lover before this war i wa a lover before this war the lazy way they turned your head into a rest stop for the dead and did it all in gold and blue and gray the effort to allay your dread in spite of all you knew and said were hard to see and harder still to say a comfort plush all laced in lead wa sent to quell your sentiment and keep your trembling sentinel hand at bay and when a sudden silhouette escaped the top side of your bed i knew you d never ever be the same ah is it not me am i not folded by your touch the word you spoke i know too much it s over now and not enough ah is it not me the damage you hold inside your blush the load you towed you showed it up it s over now and i m insane wild spirit wind from out your chest collides with world and wilderness it need a gentle hand to call it home now surf the sun and scale the moon and wind the waistband of her womb all eye ablaze the day you break your mold ah is it not me am i not culled into your clutch the word you spoke i know too much we re closer now and said enough ah is it not me am i not rolled into your crush the road you chose unloads control see it take me so go on throw this stone into this halfway home lonely little love dog that no one know the name of i know why you cry out desperate and devout timid little tether your eye set on the ether your moon in a belle luna and howling hallelujah nameless you above me come lay me low and love me this lonely little love dog that no one know the name of curse me out in free verse wrap me up and reverse this patience is a virtue until it s silence burn you and something slow ha started in me a shameless a an ocean mirrored in devotion something slow ha sparked up in me a dog cry for a master spark are whirling faster lonely little love dog that no one know the way of where the land is low is where the bone will show through lonely little love dog that no one know the day of where the land is low is where the water flow to and hold you suddenly all your history s ablaze try to breathe a the world disintegrates just like autumn leaf we re in for change holding tenderly to what remains and all your memory are a precious a gold and all the honey and the fire which you ve stole have you running through all your red cheeked day shaking loose these soul from their sacred hiding space hold your heart courageously a we walk into this dark place stand steadfast erect and see that love is the province of the brave pushed under this expanse of bursting star let this burning brightly illuminate the where we are in this hollow that lover voice occupy let it follow that we let it free let it fly breaking open the wall of this cage intoxicated oh so amazed much like falcon tumbling from the height at play conjoined talon engaged hold these heart courageously a we walk into this dark place stand steadfast beside me and see that love is the province of the brave",
