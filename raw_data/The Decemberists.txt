We are two mariners, our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
Its ribs our ceiling beams, its guts our carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill
You may not remember me, I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But I remember you, and I will relate to you
How our histories interweave
At the time you were a rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money on the whores and hounds
Oh-ohhhhh

You had a charming air, all cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in, her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease
As time wore on, you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch
Oh-ohhhhh

And then you disappeared, your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind
Then, one day in Spring, my dear sweet mother died
But before she did, I took her hand as she, dying, cried:
Oh-ohhhhh
"Find him, bind him
Tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he wakes up, naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave"
*Death rattle*

It took me fifteen years to swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat
But never once in the employ of these holy men
Did I ever once turn my mind from the thought of revenge
Oh-ohhhhh

One night I overheard the Prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship, who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty
The following day, I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear...
Oh-ohhhhh

"Find him, bind him
Tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he wakes up, naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave"
"There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed"

And then that fateful night, we had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
Your starboard flank abeam, I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath
The ocean shook, the sky went black, and the captain quailed
As before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale
Oh, oh (Screaming)
Oh (Screaming)

Don't know how I survived, the crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence, what divine intelligence!
That you should survive as well as me
It gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear
Oh, oh

When we arrive
Sons & daughters
We'll make our homes on the water
We'll build our walls aluminum
We'll fill our mouths with cinnamon now

These currents pull us 'cross the border
Steady your boats
Arms to shoulder
'Til tides all pull
Our hull aground
Making this cold harbour now home

Take up your arms
Sons and daughters
We will arise from the bunkers
By land, by sea, by dirigible
We'll leave our tracks untraceable now

I alight with the lights out
And it won't take me long just to find you
And it won't take me long just to find you

I'm allied to the winter
But don't you get clever

Gonna leave you all severed

I alone am the answer
I alone will make wrongs right

It's got to be kept from the sunlight

I'm allied to the winter

Electricity! Yeah, you can all thank me
Took some lightning, a kite, and a fat brass key
And they're putting up streetlights in Gay Paris
You’re welcome from our young nation
I’m the only American the French wanna see
They call me a genius, I can’t disagree
They have guns, they have funds
They can set us free, invest in my reputation

And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin

I said, early to bed, bitches, early to rise
They make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
Soldiers are fighting for freedom, they have no supplies
So diplomacy happens at night
John Adams debates at the gates of Versailles
He whines and berates and awaits a reply
As I stay up late with a succulent breast or a thigh
Alright, diplomacy happens at night
And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am 76-and-I’ll-Still-Kick-Your-Ass Fuckin’ Franklin

One pain that lingers, the hitch in my stride
Is my son back at home who I could not guide
Who sits all alone in a prison cell on the wrong side
Stands against our young nation
So I play my ambassador part with pride
I am known in the world and the world is wide
To my children, my sins may be magnified
But I’d do it all again, no hesitation

And do you know who the fuck I am?
Yeah, do you know who the fuck I am?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I am Poor-Richard’s-Almanack-writing
Benjamin Fuckin’ Franklin
(Do you know who the fuck I am?) Who the fuck I am?

I want you, thin fingers
I wanted you, thin fingernails
And when you bend backwards
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better

I'll love you in springtime
I lost you when summer came
And when you pulled backwards
I wanted to, I needed to
Oh-oh, to make me better
Oh-oh, to make me better

But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around to make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her
But it'd make you better
It'd make you better

I sung you your twinges
I suffered you your tattletales
And when you broke sideways
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better
Oh-oh, to make me better
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around and make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day that you met her
And it'd make you better
Did it make you better?
Make you better, oh

And all I wanted was a sliver to call mine
And all I wanted was a shimmer in your shine
To make me bright

Cause we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around and make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her
But it'd make you better
It'd make you better, oh13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It was a cold night
And the snow lay round
I pulled my coat tight
Against the falling down
And the sun was all
And the sun was all down
And the sun was all
And the sun was all down
I am a poor man
I haven't wealth nor fame
I have my two hands
And a house to my name
And the winter's so
And the winter's so long
And the winter's so
And the winter's so long
And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
It was a white crane
It was a helpless thing
Upon a red stain
With an arrow in its wing
And it called and cried
And it called and cried so
And it called and cried
And it called and cried so
And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
My crane wife, my crane wife
My crane wife, my crane wife
And now I helped her
And now I dressed her wounds
And how I held her
Beneath the rising moon
And she stood to fly
And she stood to fly away
And she stood to fly
She stood to fly away
And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
My crane wife, my crane wife
My crane wife, my crane wife

My crane wife arrived at my door in the moonlight
All star bright and tongue-tied I took her in
We were married and bells rang sweet for our wedding
And our bedding was ready when we fell in
Sound the keening bell
And see it's painted red
Soft as fontanelle
The feathers and the thread
And all I ever meant to do was to keep you
My crane wife
My crane wife
My crane wife
We were poorly, our fortunes fading hourly
And how she vowed me, she could bring it back
But I was greedy, I was vain and I forced her to weaving
On cold loom, in a closed room, with down wove
Sound the keening bell
And see it's painted red
Soft as fontanelle
The feathers and the thread
And all I ever meant to do was to keep you
My crane wife
My crane wife
My crane wife
There's a bend in the wind and it rakes at my heart
There is blood in the thread and it rakes at my heart
It rakes at my heart

And here I dreamt I was a soldier
And I marched the streets of Birkenau
And I recall in spring
The perfume that the air would bring
To the indolent town
Where the barkers call the moon down
The carnival was ringing loudly now
And just to lay with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Save lay my rifle down

And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay
Guess it's better to turn this way
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey-y, hey

And I am nothing of a builder
But here I dreamt I was an architect
And I built this balustrade
To keep you home, to keep you safe
From the outside world
But the angles and the corners
Even though my work is unparalleled
They never seemed to meet
This structure fell about our feet
And we were free to go
And try one, and try two
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, okay
Guess it's better to turn this way
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey-y, hey

And here in Spain I am a Spaniard
I will be buried with my marionettes
Countess and courtesan
Have fallen 'neath my tender hand
When their husbands were not around
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend
O' how you furrow like a lioness
And we are vagabonds
We travel without seatbelts on
To live this close to death

And try one, and try two
I guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay
Guess it's better to turn this
But I won, so you lose
Guess it always comes down to
Alright, it's okay
Guess it's better to turn this way

And under the boughs unbowed
All clothed in the snowy shroud
She had no heart so hardened
All under the boughs unbowed

Each feather it fell from skin
'Til thread bare while she grew thin
How were my eyes so blinded?
Each feather it fell from skin

And I will hang my head, hang my head low
And I will hang my head, hang my head low

A grey sky, a bitter sting
A rain cloud, a crane on wing
All out beyond horizon
A grey sky, a bitter sting

And I will hang my head, hang my head low
And I will hang my head, hang my head low
And I will hang my head, hang my head low
And I will hang my head, hang my head low

See this ancient riverbed
See where all the follies led
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag
I was just some tow-head teen
Feeling round for fingers to get in between
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag
Sweet descend this rabble round
The pretty little patter of a seaport town
Rolling in the water and
Rolling down the old main drag
All dolled up in gabardine
The lash-flashing Leda Of Pier Nineteen
Queen of the water and
Queen of the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag
The season rubs me wrong
The summer swells anon
So knock me down, tear me up
But I would bear it all broken just to fill my cup
Down by the water and
Down by the old main drag

When the summer days live to bore you
And the river lies long before you
And the one that you love ignores you
I'll be your girl

Like a senator works a full room
Like a lover undone by full moon
Like a lily alive in full bloom
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage
And all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man
But I'd be that much more
And more

So when everything soft abrades you
When fortune has long betrayed you
And you're longing for an arm to stay you
I'll be your girl
And when the tempests rage
And all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man
But I'd be that much more
And more

So if you're ever feeling less your time due
Like someone bereft and lied to
And you never need a guy to guide you
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was not ready for the road
I was so discontent to wear that heavy load
And so I got down on my knees
Made a sucker's prayer
Like Rimbaud to Baudelaire before

And when nobody did respond
I took my glasses off and went to find a pond
Stuffing rocks into the pockets of my pants
And when I waded in
Those currents carried them away

I wanna love somebody but I don't know how
I've been so long lonely and it's getting me down
I wanna throw my body in the river and drown
I wanna love somebody but I don't know how


So if you're lost along the way
And if you're thinking that will always be the case
Won't you listen to my plea?
You'll make a sucker's prayer
Just go and leave it that-a-way
I wanna love somebody but I don't know how
I've been so long lonely and it's getting me down
I wanna throw my body in the river and drown
I wanna love somebody but I don't know how

I wanna love somebody but I don't know howEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I had entered into a marriage
In the summer of my twenty-first year
And the bells rang for our wedding
Only now do I remember it clear
Alright, alright, alright

No more a rake and no more a bachelor
I was wedded and it whetted my thirst
Until her womb start spilling out babies
Only then did I reckon my curse
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

First came Isaiah with his crinkled little fingers
Then came Charlotte and that wretched girl Dawn
Ugly Myfanwy died on delivery
Mercifully taking her mother along
Alright, alright, alright

What can one do when one is widower
Shamefully saddled with three little pests
All that I wanted was the freedom of a new life
So my burden I began to divest
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Charlotte I buried after feeding her foxglove
Dawn was easy, she was drowned in the bath
Isaiah fought but was easily bested
Burned his body for incurring my wrath
Alright, alright, alright

And that's how I came your humble narrator
To be living so easy and free
Expect that you think that I should be haunted
But it never really bothers me
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(You and me in the war)

Had a dream
You and me in the war of the end times
And I believe
California succumbed to the fault line
We heaved relief
As scores of innocents died

And the Andalusian tribes
Setting the lea of Nebraska alight
Till all that remains is the arms of the angels

Hetty Green
Queen of supply-side bonhomie bone-drab
You know what I mean
On the road
It's well advised that you follow your own bag
In the year of the chewable Ambien tab

And the Panamanian child
Stands at the Dowager Empress's side
And all that remains is the arms of the angels
And all that remains is the arms of the angels
Ah ooh
Ah ooh, ooh, oh
Ah ooh
Ah ooh, ooh, oh

And you've receded into loam
And they're picking at your bones
We'll come home
We'll come home

Quiet now
Will we gather to conjure the rain down?
Will we now
Build a civilization below ground?
And I'll be crowned the community kick-it-around

And the Andalusian tribes
Setting the lea of Nebraska alight
'Til all that remains is the arms of the angels
'Til all that remains is the arms of the angels

My true love went riding out in white and green and gray
Past the pale of Offa's wall where she was won't to stray
And there she came upon a white and wounded fawn
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love"
She, being full of charity, a credit to her sex
Sought to right the fawn's hind legs when here her plans were vexed
The taiga shifted strange, the beast began to change
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
You'll learn soon enough the prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone
Fifteen lissome maidens lay alone in their bower
Fourteen occupations paid to pass the idle hour
But Margaret heaves a sigh her hands clasped to her thigh
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
You'll learn soon enough the prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone
Undone, undone, undone2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, Philomena, you in a tawdry gown
Lean to your window, let slip a ribbon down
A cure to your boredom, if only you’d let me go
Down, down, down
Long summer days can lead to lazy vices
Boys all in idle, left to their own devices
Open up your linen lap and let me go
Down, down, down
All I ever wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored
I wanted more, I wanted more
So I’ll be your candle and I’ll be your statuette
And I’ll be your lashing loop of leatherette
And oh Philomena, if only you'd let me go

Here we come to a turning of the season
Witness to the arc towards the sun
The neighbor's blessed burden within reason
Becomes a burden borne of all and one

And nobody, nobody knows
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all, don't carry it all
We are all our hands in holders
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun
But this I swear to all
A monument to build beneath the arbors
Upon a plinth that towers towards the trees
Let every vessel pitching hard to starboard
Lay its head on summer's freckled knees

And nobody, nobody knows
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all don't carry it all
We are all our hands in holders
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun
This I swear to all, this I swear to all
And there a wreath of trillium and ivy
Laid upon the body of a boy
Lazy will the loam come from its hiding
Return this quiet searcher to the soil
So raise a glass to turnings of the season
And watch it as it arcs towards the sun
And you must bear your neighbor's burden within reason
And your labors will be borne when all is done

And nobody, nobody knows
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all don't carry it all
We are all our hands in holders
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun
And this I swear to all
And this I swear to all
And this I swear to all
To all, to all, to all1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Here on these cliffs of Dover
So high you can't see over
And while your head is spinning
Hold tight, it's just beginning
You come from parents wanton
A childhood rough and rotten
I come from wealth and beauty
Untouched by work or duty

And oh, my love, my love
And oh, my love, my love
We both go down together

I found you, a tattooed tramp
A dirty daughter from the labor camps
I laid you down on the grass of a clearing
You wept but your soul was willing

And oh, my love, my love
And oh, my love, my love
We both go down together
And my parents will never consent to this love
But I hold your hand

Meet me on my vast veranda
My sweet, untouched Miranda
And while the seagulls are crying
We fall but our souls are flying

And oh, my love, my love
And oh, my love, my love
And oh, my love, oh my love
And oh, my love, my love
We both go down together2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Mother I can hear your footfall now
A soft disturbance in the dead fall how
It precedes you like a black smoke pall
Still the wanting comes in waves
And you delivered me from danger, then
Tore my cradle from the reedy glen
Swore to save me from the world of men
Still the wanting comes in waves, in waves, and waves
And the wanting comes in waves
And the wanting comes in waves
And I want this night, and I want this night

How I made you, I wrought you, I pulled you
From ore I labored you, from cancer I cradled you, and now
This is how I am repaid, this is how I am repaid?
Remember when I found you the miseries that hounded you
And I gave you motion, anointed with lotions, and now
This is how I am repaid, this is how I am repaid?

Mother hear this proposition, right:
Grant me freedom to enjoy this night
And I'll return to you at break of light
For the wanting comes in waves, and waves, and waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
And you owe me life, and you owe me life, oh

And if I grant you this favor to hand you
Your life for the evening, I will retake by morning; and so
Consider it your debt repaid, consider it your debt repaid, repaid, repaid!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Rusalka, Rusalka your arms out of water
Your hair like an alien bloom
Dark-eyed Rusalka, your brow tressed in flowers
Pale in a liminal moon
And all that you are is a star on the water
When first I went swimming, I heeded no warning
And dared breach your rippling pool
As I lulled and lingered, the ring slipped my finger
And drifted down the deepening cool
And all that I want is to fall in your shallows
And now we are wed, the water our bed
And bank to bank our property lay
And you are my wild-eyed rusalka, my river bride
Drag me down, take me away
And here we will lie, you and I, 'neath the cold, dark, sky
Beware the wild rushes, my mother told me
That grow on the bank side along the salt sea
But I being young, I heeded her none
So to the wild rushes the wind carried me
The summer was here and the sun it was high
And to the wild rushes I came by and by
And there took my seat and dipped in my feet
When through the wild rushes, a voice sweetly cried:
Come down, my little darling, come closer to me
The water is warm; it is salty and free
I long for your touch but I won't ask too much
And I, being foolish, walked in to my knees
Come down, little darling, and lay at my breast
Oh come a little closer and I'll do the rest
I waited so long for a lover to come
And I, being foolish, walked in to my chest
Come down, my little darling, oh farther come in
For deeper the water, the sweeter the sin
My lily lies here, if you'd only draw near
And I, being foolish, went in to my chin
Oh come, my little darling, do you feel my cool breath?
Do you feel my arms around you so warm and so wet?
Swept from my feet, she pulled me beneath
And in the wild rushes, I went to my deathEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
