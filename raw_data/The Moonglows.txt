We go together, like castles and kings
Birds of the feather, two robins in spring
Let's go steady, you are my first love
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We like the same things, that make living sweet
Loving like movies, in the balcony seat
Let's go steady, you are my first love
So, please, listen to me
Someday we will be
Side by side, hand in hand
You'll be wearing my wedding band
We go together, like two straws in a coke
Why not come over, and you'll meet my folks
Let's go steady, you are my first love
So, please, listen to me
Someday we will be
Side by side, hand in hand
You'll be wearing my wedding band
We go together, like two straws in a coke
Why not come over, and you'll meet my folks
Let's go steady, you are my first love
You are my first love
You are my first loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Your love is like a see saw, baby, see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby, see saw
First it's up and then it's down
It changes so fast, it never hits the ground
It goes up, down, and up like a see saw
When you said you'd be my baby, see saw
When you said you'd be my baby, see saw
I thought your love was sincere
But at this rate, it won't last a year
It goes up, down and up, like a see saw
Monday, it's a huggin' and a kissin'
And Tuesday, somethin' I've been missin'
Wednesday, ev'rything is fine
Thursday, you done changed your mind
Friday, it's the day we make up
Saturday, the day we break up
Sunday, things are goin' all right
Monday, you want to start up fightin'
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw, baby
First you're glad and then yo're mad
You're the strangest girl I ever had
It goes up, down and up, like a see sawEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Most of all, I want your warm embrace
No one can take your place
I need you most of all
Most of all, I want your sweet caress
Truly, I must confess
I need you most of all
When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I'm awake
No one's there and that's why
I'm so blue
Most of all, the one thing that I, I miss
The way we used to kiss
I need you most of all
When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I'm awake
No one's there and that's why
I'm so blue
Most of all, the one thing that I, I miss
The way we used to kiss
I need you most of allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
Well, it's three o'clock in the morning
And baby, I just can't do right
Well, I hate to leave you, baby
I don't mean maybe, because I love you so
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go
(Ba-do ba-do)
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
Well your mother and your father
They won't like it if we stay up too late
Well, I hate to leave you, baby
I don't mean maybe, you know I hate to go
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go

Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you
Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
My secret love's no secret anymore
Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
My secret love's no secret anymore...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tearsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Confess it to your heart
You're falling for her ways
You're caring more about her
She's got you in a daze
Confess it to your heart
Her kisses thrill you more
Than any other kisses
That you have had before
Though you may have reason
To think it's wrong to care
Still the love is there
Within your soul
(Within your soul)
There's no forgetting now
She's all your dreaming of
Surrender to the feeling
Confess it to your heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My blue horizon is turning gray
And my dreams are drifting away
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is love
Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes
You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says no, no, you're not the same
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes
You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says no, no, you're not the same
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love and so is loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In my diary a lot of things I'm gonna write
Write about the moon and that lonely night
And my diary will tell all about you
Tell of all of all your charms
And things you do

Diaries are made of things we do
And all the people we met
What my diary is about you
And I don't want to forget

In my diary, I'll write as plain as I can
Paint a picture with words
So the world can understand

I lay awake at night and find the world so troubled
And my answer is always the same
That unless man put an end to this horrible sin
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame

Just because I, in misery

But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, oh yeah
