Uuh

Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life (In and out my life)
You come and you go (You come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing that I can do (Uuh)

Can't help myself (Noo)
No, I can't help myself (Ooh)
Can't
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)

I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried but every time I see your face
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I'm weak for you (Weak for you)
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else (Uuh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
Do anything you ask me to (Ask me to)
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else (Uuh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you (Love you)
I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself (Uuh)
Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)

You know that I'm weak for you
 
(Yah!)
Now if you feel that you can't go on (can't go on)
Because all of your hope is gone (all your hope is gone)
And your life is filled with much confusion (much confusion)
Until happiness is just an illusion (happiness is just an illusion)
And your world around is crumbling down, darlin'

(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach on out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me
Hah, I'll be there with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through

When you feel lost and about to give up (to give up)
'Cause your best just ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
And you feel the world has grown cold (has grown cold)
And you're drifting out all on your own (drifting out on your own)
And you need a hand to hold, darlin'

(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me
Hah, I'll be there to love and comfort you
And I'll be there to cherish and care for you
(I'll be there to always see you through)
(I'll be there to love and comfort you)

I can tell the way you hang your head (hang your head)
You're not in love now, now you're afraid (you're afraid)
And through your tears you look around (look around)
But there's no peace of mind to be found (no peace of mind to be found)
I know what you're thinking - you're a loner, no love of your own
But darlin'

(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) reach out, just look over your shoulder
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there you can always depend on me
I'll be there
 
You're sweet (you're sweet) as a honeybee
But like a honeybee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left (all you left) is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories (Sweet memories)
Of a tender love that used to be
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
It's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you been gone)
And it breaks me up to hear it
Ah, oh, ah, sentimental fool am I (Sweet memories)
To hear a old love song and want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Staying (Together forever)
Darling (Breaking up never)
(Now it's the same old song) Can't bear to hear it
(With a different meaning since you been gone)
Oh, it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
Precious memories keep a-lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce the happiness we spent
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
I, oh, I can't bear to hear it
It's the same old song
(But with a different meaning since you been gone)
Ooh, it breaks me up to hear it)
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
 
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Baby, I need your loving.  (I really need you.)
Although you're never near, (I really need you.)
Your voice I often hear.  (I really need you.)
Another day, another night, (I really need you.)
I long to hold you tight, (I really need you.)
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Than weak, I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Empty nights echo your name
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Will I ever be the same
(Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Oh yeah
(Baby, baby,) When you see me smiling, you know
(I need you and I want you, baby.)
Things have gotten worse.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Any smile you might see (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Has all been rehearsed.  (And I need you and I love you, baby.)
Darling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
This emptiness won't let me live without you
(And I need you and I love you, baby.)
This loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Makes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
 
And when I see the sign that points one way
The lot we used to pass by every day
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame
From deep inside the tears
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain
That I chose to hide
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
Your name and mine inside
A heart on a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small
Just walk away, Renée
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame
 
Better wait a minute
Ya better hold the phone
Ya better mind your manners
Better change your tone

So get off my back, 'n get out my face

You wanna save your hide?
You wanna see tomorrow? (Ha-Ha!)

Want some good advice?

Cause you're walkin' on thin ice
Ya don't know what you're dealin' with

Ya don't know what you're lookin' at
But that's tough titty, kid!
The lion don't sleep tonight
And if you pull his tail, he roars

Ya say, "That ain't right!"
Ya know what I say? "Up yours!"
Watch me now!
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space
And I'm bad
I'm just a mean green mother, a real disgrace
And you've got me fightin' mad
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space
Gonna trash your ass! Gonna rock this place!
I'm mean and green
And I am bad
Don't talk to me about old King-Kong
You think he's the worst? Well, you're thinkin' wrong
Don't talk to me about Frankenstein
He got a temper? -HA!- He ain't got mine
You know I don't come from no black lagoon
I'm from past the stars and beyond the moon
You can keep the thing
Keep the it
Keep the creature, they don't mean shit!
I got garden style, major moves
I got the stuff, and I think that proves
You better move it out! Nature calls!
You got the point? I'm gonna bust your balls!
Here it comes!
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space
And I'm bad
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space
A real hard case, you can't beat this trouble, man
I'm just a mean green mother from outer space
So just give it up, it's all over, ace
I'm mean and green
(Mean green mother from outer space)
I'm mean and green
(Mean green mother from outer space)
I'm mean and green
(Mean green mother from outer space)
(Mean green mother from outer space)
And I...am...bad!
 
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Every day the sun comes up around her
She can make the birds sing harmony
Every drop of rain is glad it found her
Heaven must have made her just for me
When she smiles so warm and tender
A sight for sore eyes to see
Oooh, (ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Oh, no, they don't come better
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
(So together, like a hand in glove.)
Like pages in a letter
(Ain't no woman like the one I love.)
She can fill me up when it's down I'm goin' (I'm goin')
Put a little music in my day
Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growin' (it keeps growin')
Bigger every minute that she stays away
I would kiss the ground she walks on
'Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey, now
Woo-ooh. (Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
She's a real good friend right to the end
(So together like a hand in glove.)
A lonely man when she's gone
(People, ain't no woman like the one I love.)
Oooh. What a good, good thing I've got
She means to me a lot
(Ain't no woman like the I've got.)
No, no, they don't come better
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
(So together, like a hand in glove.)
Like pages in a letter
(Ain't no woman like the one I love, people.)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
I'm a lonely man when my baby's gone
 
Bernadette, people are searching for
The kind of love that we possess
Some go on searching their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you

And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time
(Sweet Bernadette)
They long to persuade you from my side
(Sweet Bernadette)
They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known

Bernadette, they want you because
Of the pride that it gives
But Bernadette, I want you because
I need you to live

But while I live only to hold you
Some other men, they long to control you
But how can they control you, Bernadette?
(Sweet Bernadette)
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette?
(Sweet Bernadette)
From wanting you, needing you
But darling, you belong to me

I'll tell the world, you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me
I'll tell the world, you're a part of me
Bernadette

In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for

In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
(Sweet Bernadette)
For the only joy in life is to be in love
(Sweet Bernadette)
So whatever you do, Bernadette
Keep on loving me
Bernadette, keep on needing me
Bernadette

Bernadette
You're the soul of me
More than a dream, you're a plan to me
And Bernadette, you mean more to me
Than a woman was ever meant to be
 
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Feel the pressure, your back's against the wall
Love is gaining on you, you're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love, afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings, get out while you can

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found, leaving broken hearts all over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You'll be pulling out your hair, drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been

You'll be haunted by her face, missing her warm embrace
Memories of loving her, holding her tight every night
Was that the best part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please, please don't go
Don't go, no!
Don't go! Don't go!


You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found, leaving broken hearts all over town
All over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong
Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

(Going loco down in Acapulco)
(Going loco down in Acapulco)
 
(Just ask the lonely)

When you feel that you
Can't make it all alone
Remember no one is big enough
To go it alone

Just ask the lonely
They know the hurt and pain
Of losing a love you can never regain
Just ask the lonely

The young and foolish laugh at love
So they run away...
Confident and sure that fate
Will bring another love their way

But ask the lonely
How vainly a heart can yearn
For losing a love that will never return
Just ask the lonely
They'll tell you

They'll tell you a story of sadness
A story too hard to believe
They'll tell you the loneliest one is me
Just ask the lonely
Ask me
I'm the loneliest one you'll see
(Just ask the lonely)
(Just ask the lonely)
I'm the loneliest one you'll see
 
That's not a street that you can walk
You gotta watch just who you're talking to
They're out to getcha!
Can't turn your back on a smiling face
Next thing you know, there ain't no trace, of you
And this I betcha, some people lose and some folks win
It's a matter of what they do

Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend
Don't you think you should be there?
Are you man enough when the going's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

There's no pretending it goes away
With every step that you take, you pay your dues
And I ain't lying!
You got to struggle to see the light
'Cause someone's looking to steal your right to choose
And they don't stop trying!
It's like a jungle outside the door and it's keeping you so confused

Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?

Gotta keep your eye on the passers-by, better watch your step
'Cause you never know where the knife will go
And they ain't missed yet
The strong survive, they stay alive, they always cool
But that they never teach you in school

Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend
Don't you think you should be there?
Are you man enough when the going gets rough?
Is it in your heart to care?
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
(Are you big and bad enough?)
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
 
Come on walk with me
Take my hand
Ooooh, oooh oooh
Ooohh, oooh oooh
(Still water)
Still water
Ahhh, ahhh, ahh

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know, ohh

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Ooooh

Walk with me
Take my hand
Still waters

Still water
Walk with me
Take my hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
 
I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
As far as I can see
You will always be the one for me
Oh yes you will
I believe in dreams again
I believe love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love...oh I love you girl
I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no one else has been
Deep inside can't you see
I believe in you and me
Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I would play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever
I believe in miracles
Love is a miracle
And maybe you're a dream come true
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
Mm
 
She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
I held her near
Told her how much I cared
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Everyday
When she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I spend the night
Dreaming how she used to be
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Yes It Was
Cause she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone,  my big legged girl is gone
She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
She, she's my girl
She's so foxy can't you see
And this girl belongs to me
She's my girl
When we walk down the street
I would tell everyone we meet
This is my girl
 
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
I wanna run, but there's nowhere to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
'Cause you've taken away my reasons for living
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute
Didn't I treat you right now, baby
Didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could now, baby
Didn't I?
So don't you leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Just trying my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
May come today, in fact, may come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now don't your conscience kinda bother you?
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you?
Now hold on a minute
Gave you all the love I had now
Didn't I?
When you needed me, I was always there now
Wasn't I?
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
You know crying, it ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause you all this grief?
What did I say to make you wanna leave?
Now wait a minute
Gave my heart and soul to you, baby
Didn't I?
And didn't I always treat you good now
Didn't I?
I'm standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Trying my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
I'm standing in the shadows of love...
 
I remember yet before we met
When every night and day I had to live the life of a lonely one
(Lonely one)
I remember meeting you, discovering love could be so true
When shared by two instead of only one
(Only one)
When you said you loved me
(When you said you loved me)
And we could not be parted
(We could not be parted)
I said, I built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I've never felt like this before
Loving you has made my life so much sweeter than ever
Each night I pray we never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger from day to day
As best I can, how I try to reassure you, satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away
(Went away)
'Cause I really need you
(Really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
(Need for you to need me too)
I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, yes it has
Since I'm loving you, my life is so much sweeter than ever
'Cause I really love you
(Really really love you)
Girl, I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)
I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm truly glad I found you
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
You know it has, yes it has
Loving you, since I've been loving you, my life's sweeter than ever
Since I'm loving you, my life is sweeter than ever, yes it has
 
(Seven rooms) I see a house
A house of stone
(Filled with gloom) A lonely house
'Cause now you've gone
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

You took the dream I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch a door that never rings
Bring you back into my life
Turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house
Turn this house to a home

I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me

(Seven rooms) Without your love
Your love inside
(Filled with gloom) This house is just a place
To run and hide
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) Rooms of emptiness
Without your tenderness

Don't make me live from day to day
Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way
Another reason for me to stay
I need you here, here with me
I need you, darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone
In this house that's not a home

I miss your love I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own

(Seven rooms) Empty silence
Surrounding me
(Filled with gloom) Lonely walls
They stare at me
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

All the windows are painted black
And wait right here till you come back
I'll keep waiting, waiting
Till your face again I see

(Coming back
When are you coming back?)
 
Baby, don't fight it
(Na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now)
I'm comin' baby
(Na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now)

Do you know how long a tree lives
Or the reason it grows?
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
You may ask me all these questions
But darling, no one knows

It should be clear, I really love you
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
Don't ask me why, I just do
Do you ask the Lord who loves you
Why He paints the sky clear blue?

It's the way, (it's the way) it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, (we were meant) we were meant to stay together
It's just the way nature planned it, oh
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)

Oh, don't ask me how long I'll love you
When you're gone, my heart aches
I'll never, never leave you
Girl, all my life, for you I'd wait cause it's the way

(It's the way) It's the way nature planned it
We were meant, (we were meant) we were meant to stay together
It's just the way nature planned it, girl
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)

Don't fight it, baby
(Na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now)
I'm coming, girl
(Na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now, na-na-now)

It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do 'cause it's the way
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
Mother Nature planned it
Like the stars and the sky and the beautiful heaven, ooh

(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
It's the way nature planned it
(We were meant, we were meant to stay together)
Oh, yeah

Why does a flower grow?
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
Why does the river flow?
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
We were meant, we were meant
(We were meant, we were meant to stay together)
Ooh, why does it rain?
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
Why do I feel this way?
(It's the way, it's the way nature planned it)
I love you, I love you, I love you, girl
(We were meant, we were meant to stay together)
 
Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know, that we know as love

You have words, you have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things
Your heart can rise, rise above

Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet, a sweet bouquet
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart, your hearts got to fly
Fly way
Come on and sing now...

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

It's all in the game, the game called love
It's all in the game, the game called love
 
When your in arms, Darling
When your in my arms
Oohhh

That Feeling, Feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You shake me, break me
Everytime your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
When you lock me in, your embrace
And breathlessly, you kiss my face
I get a strange sensation
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it

Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You take control
Of my very soul
Everytime your close to me
You make me quiver and shake
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
I touch your lips, your fingertips
I get a loving reaction, soul satisfaction
Darling, you know that

Feeling, Feeling
And it's got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You're earthquakin', soul shakin'

Right away I start to swoon
I'm not sure of what you got
But what it is, I like alot

Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

Everytime your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it

Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Ohhh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
