You've been looking for love
All around the world
Baby, don't you know
This country girl's still free?
Why not me?
Well, you've finally come down
To your old hometown
Your Kentucky girl's been waiting patiently
Why not me?

Why not me
On a rainy day?
Why not me
To love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me
When the nights get cold?
Why not me
When you're growing old?
Why not me?

You've been searching
From here to Singapore
Ain't it time
That you notice the girl next door, baby
Why not me?
You had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned
How good settling down could be
Why not me?


You've been looking for love
All around the world
Baby, don't you know
This country girl's still free?

Baby, why not me?
 
Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like
This world's gone crazy
Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
Where the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say?
Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days

Grandpa
Everything is changing fast
We call it progress
But I just don't know
And Grandpa, let's wonder back into the past
And paint me a picture of long ago

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget?
Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good ole days
 
Mama, I found someone
Like you said would come along
He's a sight, so unlike
Any man I've known
I was afraid to let him in
'Cause I'm not the trusting kind
But now I'm convinced
That he's heaven sent
And must be out of his mind
Mama, he's crazy
Crazy over me
And in my life is where he says
He always wants to be
I've never been so loved
He beats all I've ever seen
Mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me
And, Mama, you've always said
Better look before you leap
Maybe so, but here I go
Lettin' my heart lead me
He thinks I hung the moon and stars
I think he's a livin' dream
Well, there are men
But ones like him
Are few and far between
Mama, he's crazy
Crazy over me
And in my life is where he says
He always wants to be
I've never been so loved
He beats all I've ever seen
Mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me
Oh, Mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me
 
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining far through shadows dimmed
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh beautiful star the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'till the break of dawn
Into the land of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh beautiful star (beautiful, beautiful star) of Bethlehem (star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh beautiful star the hope, the grace
For the redeem the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crowd is one
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh beautiful star (beautiful, beautiful star) of Bethlehem (star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
 
(Kennerly/Robbins)
She was sitting cross-legged on a hood of a Ford
Filing down her nails with a emory board
Talking to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do
When she said, "You see that guy in the baseball cap?
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that."
Betty said, "I've seen him at the hardware store
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure."
And as they talked a little while he passed by
She smiled at him he just said "Hi."
He was thinking to himself as he walked away
Man, I'd like to find a girl like her someday
(Chorus)
Young love, strong love, true love
It's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
Walk those lines
Yeah, these ties will bind
Young love
Well, she just couldn't stop herself from thinking 'bout him
And at a store downtown she saw him again
She had both hands full, he held open the door
He said, "My name is Billy. I've seen you before
Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?
Can I take you out on a Saturday night?"
She didn't have to say what she was feeling inside
He could see the answer shining in her eyes
(Chorus)
Well, from that day on you couldn't keep them apart
They were side by side, heart to heart
Mama cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand
And when the baby was born she was crying again
Well, he worked real hard and put some money down
On a little old house at the edge of town
And that night as he held her he couldn't believe
That God had made a girl that he'd never ever leave
(Chorus)
She was sitting cross-legged on the hood of a Ford
Filing down her nails with an emory board
 
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

Love and only love
Love and only love
 
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
I got my reservations
And I got one for you
The train's leavin' just after dark
There's always room for a lovin' heart
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
I know my destination
It's a' waitng for me
I got no hesitation
That's where I want to be
And by the time that the sun comes up
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
(chorus)
Don't you wanna come?
Don't you wanna ride?
Don't you wanna be there by my side?
Hand in hand holding on to
A sweet salvation that is waiting for me and you
I know why I'm singin'
Don't you wanna sing too?
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?
Let the spirit move you
Just close your eyes and let it flow
Lean your head back, let it go
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
(Repeat chorus)
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
I got my reservations
And I got you for you
I know why I'm singin'
Don't you wanna sing too?
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?
Let the spirit move you
Spirit move you, yeah
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too?
 
Sitting on the porch swing
Listen to the light rain
Beating on the tin roof
Baby
Just me and you
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain
Slide on over
Baby, hold me closer
Moving to and fro
Just swaying
Like a slow freight train
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

So let the breeze keep blowing
Rocking with the rhythm of the rain
That's a fallin'
Night birds a singing
The cricket a calling
Oh, my heart will never be the same
Keep the sweet feeling flowing
Whisper in my ear, baby
Oh, feels so fine
Nights like this
Come once in a lifetime
Me and my baby
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

Oh, baby
Hold me tight say
Say you love me
That's all I wanna hear tonight
Sitting on the porch swing
Listening to the light rain
Beating on the tin roof
Baby
Just me and you
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain
Slide on over
Baby, hold me closer
Moving to and fro
Just swaying
Like a slow freight train
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

Me and my baby
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain
 
I was standing in line
At the city bus stop
Soaked to the skin from every rain drop
I see you driving by
Just like a phantom jet
With your arm around some little brunette
You say you won't be home
Because you're working late
Honey, I'm no fool
You've been out on a date
The lipstick on your collar gives the game away
It's strawberry red
And mine's pink rose

Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad
I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart
Can't you see?
Baby, baby
Have mercy on me

Well
I called you up on the telephone
I could hear you was playing Haggard and Jones
I knew right then
Tthat there was something wrong
There's only one reason you play cheating songs


Went to the bank with my little checkbook
The cashier he gave me the strangest look
He said you ain't got no money
Cause you're overdrawn
Your man took it all and he's done gone
 
People say God looks out for the working man
Sure hope He's looking out for me
These empty pockets need a helping hand
Kitchen tables full of family
But then the sun comes up
(Sun comes up)
And the moon is shining big and bright
And the new day promises (promises)
That everything will be alright
And the new day promises
That everything will be alright
 
One day a mother
Come to a prison
To see an 'erring
But precious son
She told the warden
How much she loved him
It did not matter
What he had done
She did not bring to him
(Bring to him)
Parole or pardon
(Pardon free)
She brought no silver
(Brought no gold)
No pomp nor style
(Him to see)
It was a halo
(Halo bright)
Sent down from heaven
(Heaven's light)
The sweetest gift
(A mother's smile)
Her boy had wandered
Far from the far side
Though she had pleaded
With him each night
But not a word did
She ever utter
That told her heartaches
Her smile was bright
(Repeat Chorus)
She left a smile
You can remember
She's gone to heaven
From heartache's free
Them bars around you
Will never change her
He was her baby
An error will be
(Repeat Chorus)
It was a halo bright
Sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift
A mother's smile
 
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight ain't nothing gonna slow me down
I did my time working all week
Tonight's all mine
Tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound
Well, I've been couped up
All week long
I've been working my fingers to the bone

Well, it's a girls' night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance
'Til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt
Lordy, it's a girls' night out

Two step or the Cotton Eye Joe
They can play 'em fast
Or they can play 'em slow
I can do 'em all just show me the floor
You can give me a little rock 'n roll
Or even a waltz with the lights down low
I'll still be dancing
When they close the door


Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down
I did my time working all week
Tonight's all mine
Tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound
Well, I've been couped up
All week long
I've been working my fingers to the bone
 
Dear, Mama
Well, here's a letter from your girl
Well, I think my city days are done, Mom
And it ain't been three weeks since I came
And Mama
Do remember what you said
Say your prayers before you go to bed, child
And remember
City boys ain't the same

I'm like a John Deere Tractor
In a half acre field
Tryin' to plow a furrow
Where the soil is made of steel

How I wish I was home, Mom
Where the blue grass is growing
And the sweet country boys don't complain
And, Mama
So much perfume I thought I'd drown
And the Lord didn't seem
To be nowhere around
Hey, I felt just like a flower from the vine


How I'd like to be home, Mom
Where the blue grass is growing
And the fire light shimmers
And it shines
 
Oooh
I'm missing you
I've got those bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues
Oooh
Ain't much to do
Just sing those bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues

Having the blues
Hating to loose
Guess I got a lot to learn
All of my friends have lost
Now and then
I guess it's just my turn


Tell me the first
Hurt you the worst
And time is your best friend
But when you're this sad
And hurting this bad
How do you love again?

Bye-bye
Bye-bye baby blues
 
Some call it country with a little bit of rhythm and blues
And when the boys start rockin'
There's a beat that you just can't lose
Where it's gonna take us nobody knows
It sure feels good to the body and soul
(Chorus)
I love the slide of a steel guitar
I love the moan of an old blues harp
I love the shake of a tamborine
I love the bass when it's low and mean
So put on your shoutin' shoes
And turn it loose
Turn it loose
You feel like dancin' and you just can't stay in your seat
Your knees start knockin' and you can't help stompin' your feet
Before you even know it you'll be singin' along
Makes me wanna stay here all night long
(Repeat Chorus)
Turn it loose
Everybody put on your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
Grab your shoutin' shoes and turn it loose
 
Billy was a small town loner
Who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern Arizona
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies
But he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladder
He knew the way in a small cafe, found the will
He met Miss Bonnie
And a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months latter
The feeling got strong enough
They didn't own a car
So it must have been love
That drove him uptown for a diamond
That's when he started goin?
(Chorus)
Over the line
Working overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her where would he be?
See, it's not for him
She is his only need
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
A new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children
And my, how the time did fly
The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray
And every once in a while you could see him get up
And he's head downtown
'Cause he heard about something she wanted
And it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much
It was love
And, boy, ain't that love just something
When it's strong enough to keep a man goin?
(Repeat Chorus)
Over the line
Working overtime
She is his only need
His only need
Overboard
Over the limit
Just for her
She is his only need
His only need
 
I will never back down from a good fair fight
I will find my way through the darkest night
I will never be wrong for doin' whats right
I will stand by you
I will never run from what I believe
I am stronger still when I'm on my knees
I am ready as I'll ever be
'Cause i will stand by you
I can carry the world on my shoulders
This I know is true
And when you need me I will be there
Know that I will stand by you
Let the walls fall down
I will shelter you
When the seas rise up
I'll rise up too
No matter what happens i'll know what to do
I will stand by you
I can carry the world on my shoulders
This I know is true
If you need me
I will be there
Know that I will stand by you
I'm a woman of faith thats unshakeable
I may bend,but im unbreakable
And you can count on me
I will never back down from a good fair fight
I will find my way through the darkest night
I will never be wrong for doing whats right
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand byyyyyy youuuu
I will stand by youuu
I will never back down
I will stand by you
I will find my way
I will stand by you
I will stand by youu
I will never run
I will stand by you
 
Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens whatever may be
Here is what Christmas time means to me
Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day
City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells silver bells
Silver bells silver bells
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day
Soon it will be Christmas Day
 
I've tried so hard
You know I can't do more
It's the turn of the card
It's the close of the door
The lies you told
You know they hurt so deep
So I'll go home
And cry myself to sleep
And day after day
You've been treating me bad
Friends come up and say
Why do you take all that?
'Cause it's making me moan
And it's making me weep
So I'll go home
And cry myself to sleep
You play at love
Like a child plays games
One day I'm in
Then I'm out again
You change the rules
And I just can't win
You've broken me now
So I give in
Yeah, yeah
I've been through worse
But I don't know what
Oh, I gave to you
Everything that I got
So take this heart
Or what's left to keep
And I'll go home
And cry myself to sleep
So I'll go home
And cry myself to sleep
Cry myself to sleep
 
You can buy a diamond ring
And slip it on my hand
Put me on a big ol' plane
And fly me to a foreign land
Show me rows of fancy clothes
Saying, "Honey you can take your pick!"
Well, that would be mighty kind
But it ain't gonna do the trick
(Chorus)
Give a little love
A squeeze and a little kiss
Give a little hug
Mmm, I want some more of this
Take a little time
Yeah, make a little fuss
That's what a woman wants
So give a little love
Get this, you can be some big hunk
Handsome, dark and tall
Talk to me in foreign tongues
Or with a southern drawl
Or be a man from old Siam
Wear a pointed hat
I don't care how you look
'Cause that ain't where it's at
(Repeat Chorus)
Well, there are men who'll turn your head
And knock you off of your feet
Sweet talk and big blue eyes
Make a poor heart skip a beat
Drive you wild with a smile
And then they'll treat you cruel
Well, I ain't gonna fall for that
'Cause Mama didn't raise no fool
(Repeat Chorus)
