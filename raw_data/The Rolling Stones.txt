Yow....yow....yow
Huh, huh, huh

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
Well, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah
Oh yeah, get down heavy!


Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game, mm yeah
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, mmm mean it
Get down
Woo hoo!
Ah yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Ba bum bum, ba ba bum....
Ah yeah
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
Tell me, honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo hoo, ooo hoo, oooo hoo
All right
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yes, what's my name?
Tell me, baby, ah what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black

To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And, man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him:

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

Wild horses couldn't drag me away

Supposed to fire my imagination

I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you sometime

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you, child
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're goingna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls thats just dying to meet you
We're goinna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh, baby, why you waitin' so long?
Won't you come on, come on?
I've been walkin' Central Park, singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet, shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes, I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, I won't miss you child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't miss you, child
You've just been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time

I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris

Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free

She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Will lose your mind
