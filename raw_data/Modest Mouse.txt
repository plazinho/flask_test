I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright

Already, we'll all float on
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright
Already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, we'll all float on

(Alright, already) And we'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on 
Alright, already, we'll all float on 
Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on 
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on 
Alright, already, we'll all float on (Alright!) 
Now don't you worry, we'll all float on (Alright!)
We'll all float on
 
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

My boss just quit the job
Says he's going out to find blind spots
And he'll do it

The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand

Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
Baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
Baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

Well, the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over
 
Ice age heat wave, can't complain
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door, and again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you've still got your words and you've got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder, work another way
Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?

The days get shorter and the nights get cold
I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot, but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising, but it's spring and I should leave
I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside, water, like air, was gray
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plan
You said that you did, but you didn't understand
I know that starting over's not what life's about
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud
 
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth, but still cough down our sleeves

Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
 
Woke up this morning, and it seemed to me
That every night turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

Well, we sat on the edge of the river
The crowd screamed, "Sacrifice the liver!"
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver
So tell me now why, you'll tell me never
Who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Well, see what you want to see
You should see it all
Well, take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten
Our hearts just get dissolved
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
Here we go

If God controls the land and disease
And keeps a watchful eye on me
If he's really so damn mighty
Well, my problem is I can't see
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Evil home stereo
What good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know
What good curves can you throw?

Well, all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake, okay?

I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
(I fucked up the last line)
 
Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, don't think so

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Well I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I hope so

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

Well, that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw, and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
(You missed)
When the Earth folded in on itself (You missed)
And said "Good luck, for your sake I hope Heaven and Hell
(You missed, you missed)
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well, I don't mind, I don't mind
How the hell could I mind?

Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Well, that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste the afterlife?
 
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate, of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids, of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything

And I shout that you're all fakes (Fakes)
And you should've seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your bellyaches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you

Sometimes all I really want to feel is love
Sometimes I'm angry that I feel so angry
Sometimes my feelings get in the way
Of what I really feel I needed to say

If you sit in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but he's lost the joke now
Our communications come in one lined jokes
From stand up comics and rock musicians
Making so much noise you don't know when to listen

Why are you judging people so damn hard?
You're taking your point of views a bit too far
I made my shoes shine with black coal
But the polish didn't shine the hole

If you sit in a circle
Then you'll all have a back to bite
Backlogged books on the seven wonders
We're all so funny but he's lost the joke now
Our communications come in one lined jokes
From stand up comics and rock musicians
Making so much noise you don't know when to listen

Think it over
There's the air of the height of the highrollers
Think it over
You ain't got nothing until you know her
 
From the top of the ocean, yeah
From the bottom of the sky, goddamn
Well, I get claustrophobic
I can, you know that I can, well
From the top of the ocean, yeah
From the bottom of the sky, goddamn
Well, I get claustrophobic
I can, you know that I can

And he said
"I am not allowed much danger
Keep in line, you're an old friend, stranger
You'll burn me in effigy and I'll burn you in effigy"
Well, a rattlesnake up in Buffalo, Montana
He bit the leg of the old sheriff
Ha, that boy fell down on his harelip—Oh, oh
Well I, I might be wrong
But you, you tag along
And we, we've all been wronged
And I feel dizzier by the mile
Said, "Hell yeah, the money's spent"
Went to the county line and paid the rent
I said, "Uh-oh", I said "Uh-oh"

Oh, if you could compact your conscience
Oh, and you might
Oh, if you could bottle and sell it, you might have done
Oh, and you might
Oh, if you could compact your conscience
And sell it, save it for another time
You know you might have to use it

And the television's on
Go to the grocery store, buy some new friends
And find out the beginning, the end, and the best of it
Well, do you need a lot of what you got to survive?

Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles, shimmers, shines
Let's all have another Orange Julius
Thick syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon-to-be ghost towns
Well, so long, farewell, goodbye

Take 'em all for the long ride
And you'll go 'round town
No one wants to be uptight anymore
You could be ashamed or be so proud of what you've done
But not no one, not now, not ever or anyone

Take 'em all for the sad, sad happiness
That comes from hurting deep down inside
Or you could add it up and give a shit, give a shit
Go to the family doctor
It's all worth it, all worth and it's
All, all wrong, and it's all, all gone
Or you could add it up and give a shit, give a shit
I'm on the corner of this and this and this and it's
All, all wrong, and it's all, all wrong

Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles, shimmers, shines
Let's all have another Orange Julius
Thick syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon-to-be ghost towns
Well, so long, farewell, goodbye

And the telephone goes off
Pick the receiver up, try to meet ends
And find out the beginning, the end and the best of it
Oh my, God damn

Take 'em all for the long ride
And you'll go 'round town
No one wants to be uptight anymore
You could be ashamed or be so proud of what you've done
But not no one, not now, not ever or anyone
 
(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
The room lit up and we ran about
Well, this is what I'd really call a party now
Packed up our cars, moved to the next town
Well, the lampshade's on fire and the lights go out
This is what I'd really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
This one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
Shaved off my eyebrows, let 'em fall to the ground
So I can't look surprised right now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Burn it up or just chop it down
This one's done so where to now?

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

Well, the lampshade's on fire when the lights go out
This is what I really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
Ah, this one's done so where to now?
Our eyes light up, we have no shame at all
Well, you all know what I'm talking about
The room lights up, well, we're still dancing around
We're having fun, having some fun now
Pack up again, head to the next place
Where we'll make the same mistakes
Open one up and let it fall to the ground
Pile out the door when it all runs out

(Up-up-up-up up-up ba-da-dah
Duh-duh-duh-duh duh-duh da-da-dah)
We're all going, we're all going

We have spines and other bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw stones
Oh, this is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Well, we're the human race
We're going to party out this place
And then move on
(Tough luck)
We'll kill you off and then make a clone
Yeah, we got spines and we have bones!
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go
Our soft feelings are getting hurt
Oh, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside these jeans
Well, we want just our water clean
This is how it's always been
And this is how it's going to be
So, you just move on

(Yow!)
The air's on fire so we're moving on
Better find another one 'cause this one's done
Waiting for the magic of the scientist's glove
To push, push, push, push, pull us up
Spend some time to floating out in space
Find another planet, make the same mistakes
Our minds all shatter when we climb on board
Hoping for the scientists to find another door
(Yeah)
 
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight

Looking kind of anxious in your cross-armed stance
Like a bad-tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
So I blame this town, this job, these friends
The truth is it's myself
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
When I finally get it figured out
I've changed the whole damn plan

Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight

Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight

Talking shit about a pretty sunset
Blanketing opinions that I'll probably regret soon
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
 
Open up a window
All the air, oh, the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
We'll deal with the remainder
When the dents, the dents get hammered out
Then we'll travel through time

The world's an inventor
With its work crawling, running, squirming 'round
Trees drop colorful fruits
Directly into our mouths
The world's an inventor
We're the dirtiest thing it's thought about
And we really don't mind

We'll probably never get there
Bring your sight seers school teachers down
It's a watercolor weekend
All the trees are turning colors now
We'll probably never get there
Bring your candy taster, time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds

The world composes
With his shirttails wrinkled, hanging out
Bang us together
See what sort of sounds we make right now
The world plays music
Playing skin on teeth inside of the mouth
What sort of sounds?
What lovely sounds come about?

We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna pull things out
We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna travel time

We're gonna throw a party
All the ghosts of trees are coming out
Don't move in any direction
Wait until the light's inside of the cloud
You're gonna wanna see this
Don't bring your camera around
Watch sun and sawdust align

We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna pull things out
We greased all the ropes
We'll throw you a line
We're gonna break these boulders
We're gonna travel time

Close up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
Our predecessor left this box
And something's clawing around
I think it really wants out
 
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war
He's gonna start a war
And he hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He goes to the desert, fires a rifle in the sky
And says, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He "didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately"

Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over

Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Everytime you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
Everytime you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
Everytime you think you're looking, you're just looking down

Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
'Cause Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
Goes to the desert, fires a rifle in the sky
And says, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He "didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately"

Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Yeah, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
 
Slow walk
From land mines
It's a coal mine
It's a bad thought

I'm on my way to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal

I'm trying to get my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I'm on my way to God, don't know or don't care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shores
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward
In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo
We tore one down and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air

On my, on my way to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal

In this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go so slow
The days go so slow
The days go slow

I'm on my way to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the coal

I'm trying to get my head clear
I push things out through my mouth, I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled through my ears
I get refilled...
I'm on my way to God, don't know or even care
My brain's the weak heart and my heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
My heart's the long stairs
Inland from Vancouver shores
The ravens and the seagulls push each other inward and outward
Inward and outward
In this place that I call home
My brain's the cliff and my heart's the bitter buffalo
My heart's the bitter buffalo
We tore one down and erected another there
The match of the century, absence versus thin air
Absence versus thin air

In this life that we call home
The years go fast and the days go slow
The days go so slow
 
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted
But we still have the radio
Oh, it should've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well it sounds like someplace I'd like to go
Oh, it could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
Well, the windshield was broken
But I love the fresh air you know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know, oh!
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing
Which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Oh! It would've been, could've been
Worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks
But I was already where I want
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh if the world don't like us
It'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old
Now here we go!

Well we scheme and we scheme but would always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each East and West horizon
Every dawn one yells "Surprise"
And in the evening one's consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"

Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. oh-oh-oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show

Yeah, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we had to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, we could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well it sounds like the place I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each East and West horizon
Every dawn one yells "Surprise"
And in the evening one's consoling
Saying "See it wasn't quite as bad as"

Oh it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know!
 
Well all the Apostles, they're sitting in swings
Saying, "I'd sell off my Savior for a set of new rings
And some sandals with the style of straps
That cling best to the era"
So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash
To each other, but they're sick of it all
And they're bankrupt on selling
And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
For a set of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved, their old friends
And I've seen through 'em all, seen through 'em all
Seen through most everything
All the people you knew were the actors
All the people you knew were the actors
Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right I'll be heard
You'll remember the guy that said all those big words
He must've learned in college
And it took a long time till I came clean with myself
I come clean out of love with my lover
I still love her, loved her more
When she used to be sober and I was kinder
 
Oh, gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that riding on your everything?
It isn't anything at all

Oh, gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that writing on your shelf
In the bathrooms and the bad motels?
No one really cared for it at all
Not the gravity plan

Early, early in the morning
It pulls all on down my sore feet
I wanna go back to sleep

In the motions and the things that you say
It all will fall, fall right into place
As fruit drops, flesh it sags
Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay
But at least I don't see you float away
And all the spilt milk, sex and weight
It all will fall, fall right into place

Oh, gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that riding on your everything?
It isn't anything at all

Early, early in the morning
It pulls all on down my sore feet
I wanna go back to sleep

In the motions and the things that you say
It all will fall, fall right into place
As fruit drops, flesh it sags
Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay
But at least I don't see you float away
 
While we're on the subject
Could we change the subject now?
I was knocking on your ear's door
But you were always out
Looking towards the future
We were begging for the past
Well, we knew we had the good things
But those never seemed to last
Oh, please just last

Everyone's unhappy
Everyone's ashamed
Well, we all just got caught looking
At somebody else's page
Well, nothing ever went
Quite exactly as we planned
Our ideas held no water
But we used them like a dam

Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and I laugh all the way to Hell
Saying, "Yes, this is a fine promotion"
Oh, and I laugh all the way to Hell

Of course everyone goes crazy
Over such and such and such
We made ourselves a pillar
We just used it as a crutch
We were certainly uncertain
At least, I'm pretty sure I am
Well, we didn't need the water
But we just built that good-God-dam

Oh, and I know this of myself
I assume as much for other people
Oh, and I know this of myself
We've listened more to life's end-gong than
The sound of life's sweet bells

Was it ever worth it?
Was there all that much to gain?
Well, we knew we'd missed the boat
And we'd already missed the plane
We didn't read the invite
We just dance at our own wake
All our favorites were a-playing
So we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Tiny curtain's open
And we heard the tiny clap of little hands
A tiny man would tell a little joke
And get a tiny laugh from all the folks
Sittin', driftin' around on bubbles, and
Thinkin' it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out
That we had truly missed the boat

Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves
But not the skills to make a shelf with
Oh, what useless tools ourselves
 
Well, all's not well but I'm told that it'll all be quite nice
You'll be drowned in boots like mafia
But your feet will still float like Christ's
Well, I'll be damned
They were right
I'm drowning upside down
My feet afloat like Christs'
I'm in heaven trying to figure out which stack
They're going to stuff us Atheists into
And Peter and his monkey laugh and I'll laugh with them
I'm not sure what at
They point and say:
"We'll keep you in the back,"
Polishing halos, baking manna and gas

Well, some guy comes in looking a bit like everyone I ever seen
He moves just like Crisco disco
Breathin' a hundred percent Listerine
He says looking at something else but directing everything to me
"Any time anyone gets on their knees to pray
Well, it makes my telephone ring" and I'll be damned
He said "You were right, no one's running this whole thing"
He had a theory, too

He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you


It's all nice, it's all nice
It's all nice on ice, alright

It's all nice, it's all nice
It's all nice on ice, alright

"One, two, three...
Four."
 
Yeah dah dah dah dah... Is there an ashtray in here?
-Can we smoke in here?
-Yeah, Eric said it was in his pockets
The good times... (Yeah!)
Who needs the good times?
The good times are killing me

The good times are killing me
Here we go

Got dirt, got air, got water
And I know you can carry on
Shrugged off shortsighted false excitement
And oh what can I say?
Have one, have twenty more "one mores"
And oh it does not relent

The good times are killing me

Kick butt, buzz-cut dickheads
Who didn't like what I said
The good times are killing me
Jaws clenched tight, we talked all night
Oh but what the hell did we say?
The good times are killing me

The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me

Fed up with all that LSD
Need more sleep than coke or methamphetamines
Late nights with warm, warm whiskey
I guess the good times they were all just killing me

Got dirt, got air, got water
And I know you can carry on
The good times are killing me
Enough hair of the dog to make myself an entire rug
The good times are killing me
Have one, have twenty more "one mores"
And oh it does not relent
The good times are killing me
Shit-kicker, city slickers who all wanted me dead
The good times are killing me
Get sucked in and stuck in late nights
With more folks that I don't know
The good times are killing me

The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me

The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
The good times are killing me
