I don't know just where I'm goin'
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushin' on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closin' in on death
You can't help me, not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Goin' from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life, haha
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
Heh, and that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm good as dead
And thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
Oh, and I guess I just don't know
 
Sunday morning brings the dawning
It's just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's just the wasted years so close behind

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want to know
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's all the streets you crossed not so long ago

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all


Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
 
Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly, you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountain top
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes


Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said, "Money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up"

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'll do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
 
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorned, imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly
Taste the whip, now bleed for me

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Severin, your servant comes in bells, please don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart
 
I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man
Oh, work it now


Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody bodies pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah, then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling, oh, so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man
Walk it home

Oh, it's alright
Huh huh
 
Standin' on the corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest
And me, I'm in a rock 'n' roll band
Huh
Riding in a Stutz Bear Cat, Jim
Ya know, those were different times
Oh, all the poets they studied rules of verse
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, woah
Sweet Jane, oh oh
Sweet Jane

Let me tell ya somethin', Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
And both of them save their monies
Hah, and when, when they come home from work
Ooh, sittin' down by the fire, oh
The radio does play the classical music there, Jim
The March of the Wooden Soldiers
All you protest kids, you can hear Jack say
Get ready

Sweet Jane, come on, baby
Sweet Jane, oh
Sweet Jane

Some people, they like to go out dancin'
And other peoples, they have to work, just watch me now
And there's even some evil mothers
Well, they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that women never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, ooh
And that, ya know, children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die
But anyone who ever had a heart
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it

Sweet Jane, oh woah
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her, hey, when she smiles
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la-la-la

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
 
Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up to just put you down, what a clown

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number thirty seven, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
Oh whoa whoa (She's a femme fatale)
Oh whoa whoa (She's a femme fatale)
Oh whoa whoa (She's a femme fatale)
 
I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside, you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty you are
But if you don't, let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside, you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
 
1-2-3

If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the wineglass out and drink a toast to never
Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes
And say hello, you're my very special one
But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
Oh, but people look well in the dark

And If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
'Cause if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again

I'd never have to see the day again, once more
I'd never have to see the day again
 
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties?
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door


And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties?
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties?
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around?
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door


And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties?
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties
 
Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
"I sold my soul, must be saved
Gonna take a walk down to Union Square
You never know who you're gonna find there"

You gotta run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do

Marguerita Passion, I had to get her fixed
She wasn't well, she was getting sick
Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
Didn't know, thinks she could buy it

And she would run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do


Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
When she turned blue, all the angels screamed
They didn't know, they couldn't make the scene

She had to run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do


Beardless Harry, what a waste
Couldn't even get a small-town taste
Rode the trolleys down to 47th
Figured he was good to get himself to heaven

Because he had to run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do
 
Candy says
"I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world"
Candy says
"I'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly talk about"

"I'm going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me?"

Candy says
"I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be"
Candy says
"I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind"

"I'm going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me?"
 
Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all
He knocked the shirt right off his back
He ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
He walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right off his feet
And threw the poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said

Oh sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all
Oh sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all

Say a word for Pearly May
She can't tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
Just like a cat she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joana Love
She ain't got nothing at all
With every day she falls in love
And every night she falls
And when she does she says

Oh sweet nuthin'
You know she ain't got nuthin' at all
Whoa oh, sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all
Oh let me hear you


Oh, say a word, say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all, not a thing
And not a shirt, shirt on his back
No, he ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger
He walks with his head to the ground
He took the shoes, took the shoes from his feet, from his feet
And threw the poor boy out into the street
And then he said

Oh sweet sweet nuthin'
She ain't got, she ain't got, she ain't got nuthin' at all
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet nuthin'
(Ain't got nothing at all)
She ain't got
Sweet sweet nuthin'
Sweet sweet nuthin' at all
Sweet sweet nuthin' got nuthin'
Oh sweet nuthin'
Oh oh sweet nuthin' at all
Oh let me hear you

Oh, sweet nuthin'

She ain't got nuthin' at all
She ain't got nuthin' at all
She ain't got nuthin' at all
She ain't got nuthin' at all
She ain't got nuthin' at all
She ain't got nuthin' at all
Sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all
Sweet sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nuthin' at all
 
Duck and Sally inside
They're cooking for the down pipe
Who're staring at Miss Rayon
Who's busy licking up her pig pen
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like Sister Ray said
Whip it on

Rosey and Miss Rayon
They're busy waiting for her booster
Who just got back from Carolina
She said she didn't like the weather
They're busy waiting for her sailor
Who says he's just as big as ever
He says he's from Alabama
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like Sister Ray said
Play on

Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks and shoots between three and four
He aims it at the sailor
Shoots him down dead on the floor
Oh, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
Now don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
And by the way, have you got a dollar?
Oh, no, man, I haven't got the time, time
Too busy sucking on a ding-dong
She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
Oh, she does just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, couldn't, couldn't hit it sideways
Oh it, it just, just all over the floor, the floor

Now, who's that knocking?
Who's that knocking on my chamber door?
Now could it be the police?
They come to take me for a ride, ride
Oh, but I haven't got the time, time
Hey, hey, hey she's busy sucking on my ding-dong
She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
Oh, now, just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like
And, just like
And, just like, yea, Sister Ray said, do it!

Now Rosie and Miss Rayon
They're busy waiting for her booster
She's just back from Carolina
She said she's bound to beat her sailor
I said she hasn't got the time time
Too busy sucking on my ding-dong
Too busy sucking on my ding-dong
Now, just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Whip it on me Jim, whip it on me Jim, whip it on me Jim
Said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, do it
Now just like... just like Sister Ray said

I said now Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks it, shoots it bang between three and four

I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like
Now, just like
I said oh, just like
Am-ph-ph-ph-ph-ph-ph-phetamines!
 
Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. It was now mid-August, which meant he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had to show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone calls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would date occasionally, but merely as amusement. She would remain faithful
But lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when he did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion. It was more than the human mind could bear
Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how she really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and he wasn't there. (Awww...)
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled to appear. He'd just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons' lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs. At least they cared enough to write
It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck him. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion, true, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself parcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few air holes, some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as going tourist!
By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the Post Office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package "Fragile", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marsha's face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of this before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough weekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about it though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all, it was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no, he didn't love her, he did feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo! But that seemed many years ago
Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen. "Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside."
"Ach, I know what you mean, I feel all icky!"
Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. "I'm supposed to be taking these salt pills, but," she wrinkled her nose, "they make me feel like throwing up." Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd seen on television. "God, don't even talk about that." She got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins. "Want one? Supposed to be better than steak," and then attempted to touch her knees. "I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again."
She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone. "Maybe Bill'll call," she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on a cuticle. "After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him." "I know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place." She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. "The thing is, after a while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know what I mean." She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth. "I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while," here she bent forward in a whisper, "I wanted to!" Now she was laughing very loudly
It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang the doorbell of the large stucco-colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den
"What do you think it is?" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back. She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room. "I dunno."
Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton. "Why don't you look at the return address and see who it's from?" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the vibrating footsteps. It would be soon!
Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. "Ah, god it's from Waldo!"
"That schmuck!" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation. "Well, you might as well open it," said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the staple flap
"Ah sst," said Marsha, groaning, "he must have nailed it shut." They tugged on the flap again. "My God, you need a power drill to get this thing open!" They pulled again. "You can't get a grip." They both stood still, breathing heavily
"Why don't you get a scissor," said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but all she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand. "This is the best I could find." She was very out of breath. "Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die." She sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough room. "God damn this thing!" she said, feeling very exasperated. Then smiling, "I got an idea."
"What?" said Marsha
"Just watch," said Sheila, touching her finger to her head
Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through the cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of Waldo Jeffers' head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun
 
There she goes again (There she goes)
She's out on the streets again (There she goes)
She's down on her knees, my friend (There she goes)
But you know she'll never ask you please again (There she goes)

Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
She won't take it from just any guy

What can you do? (There she goes)
You see her walkin' on down the street (There she goes)
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet (There she goes)
You better hit her

There she goes again (There she goes)
She's knocked out on her feet again (There she goes)
She's down on her knees, my friend (There she goes)
But you know she'll never ask you please again (There she goes)

Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
Like a bird, you know she will fly

What can you do? (There she goes)
You see her walkin' on down the street (There she goes)
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet (There she goes)
You better hit her

Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
Like a bird, you know she will fly, fly, fly away (Fly, fly, fly, fly)

Oh, see her walking on down the street (Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet (Fly, fly, fly, fly)
She's gonna bawl and shout, she's gonna work it
She's gonna work it out, bye bye (Bye, bye, bye, bye)
Bye, bye, b-bye, bye, bye, b-b-b-b-bye, bye, bye, baby
(Bye, bye, bye, bye)
Oh, she's alright, she's alright
 
Myriad had choice of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red rimmed and red lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game

I che che, che che I
Che che che, ka tah koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go
 
Lady Godiva, dressed so demurely
Pats the head of another curly haired boy, just another toy
Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
Saying words that have oh so clearly been said
So long ago

Draperies wrapped gently 'round her shoulder
Life has made her that much bolder now
That she's found out how

Dressed in silk, latin lace and envy
Pride and joy of the latest penny fare
Pretty passing care
Hair today now dipped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun?

Now, today, propping grace with envy
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
And hasn't a care
Doctor is coming the nurse thinks *sweetly!*
Turning on the machines that *neatly pump air!*
The body lies bare
Shaved and hairless what once was *screaming!*
Now lies silent and *almost sleeping*
The brain must have gone away
*Strapped securely to the white table*
*Ether caused the body to wither and writhe*
Underneath the white light
*Doctor arrives with knife and baggage*
*Sees the growth as just so much cabbage*
That must now be cut away
*Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!*
*The doctor is making his first incision*

One goes here--*one goes there*
"The ether tube's leaking," says someone who's sloppy
*The patient, it seems, is not so well sleeping*
The screams echo up the hall
Don't panic, someone give him pentothol instantly
Doctor removes his blade
Cagily slow from the brain
*By my count of ten--*
*The head won't move*

You killed your European son
You spit on those under twenty-one
But now your blue cars are gone
You better say so long
Hey hey hey, bye bye bye

You made your wallpapers green
You want to make love to the scene
Your European son is gone
You'd better say so long
Your clowns bid you goodbye
