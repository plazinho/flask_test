When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry)
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)203EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Long ago, just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave, and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide?

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight88EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah
They said "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
All together now

"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
"Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me95EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now!

But I'm okay, I'm okay!
I'm okay now, "I'm okay now," but you really need to
Listen to me, because I'm telling you the truth!
I mean this, I'm okay! "Trust me..."
I'm not okay
I'm not okay, well, I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay!
I'm not okay

Could I? Should I?

Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can

When you go, and would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you oughta stay

And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa
When you go, and would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?

Well, come on, come on

When you go, would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you like I loved you yesterday"?

I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to Hell
Oh well, now, Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry
Mama, we're all gonna die

And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love

Mama, we're all full of lies
Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now, they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies

Well, mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should've raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection, they can amputate at once
You should've been, I could have been a better son
And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go

She said, "You ain't no son of mine
For what you've done, they're gonna find
A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love," that's right

Mama, we all go to Hell
Mama, we all go to Hell
It's really quite pleasant except for the smell
Mama, we all go to Hell (One, two, three, four)
Mama, Mama, Mama
Mama, Mama, Mama, Ma

"And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song"
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along
We're damned after all
Through fortune and flame we fall
And if you can stay, then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call
We all carry on (We all carry on)
When our brothers in arms are gone (When our brothers in arms are gone)
So raise your glass high, for tomorrow, we die

Now, I know that I can't make you stay, but where's your heart?
But where's your heart? But where's your-
And I know there's nothing I can say to change that part
To change that part, to change...

So many bright lights, they cast a shadow, but can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding, I get so weak
A love that's so demanding, I can't speak

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

Can you see, my eyes are shining bright, 'cause I'm out here
On the other side of a jet black hotel mirror, and I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A love that's so demanding, I get weak

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me, I say!

I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid, asleep or dead
(How can I see, I see you lying)
'Cause I see you lying next to me

With words I thought I'd never speak

Turn away, if you could get me a drink
Of water, 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my Aunt Marie, help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

Now turn away, 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
But counting down the days to go, it just ain't living
And I just hope you know

That if you say (If you say)
Goodbye today (Goodbye today)
I'd ask you to be true (I'd ask you to be true)

Eight legs to the wall

You be my detonator

Love, gimme love

But I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, (In a box)
Put an "X" on the floor

All the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvie halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world

Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try now

In the middle of a gunfight
In the center of a restaurant
They say, "Come with your arms raised high"

Too much, too late, or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again

They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost
My cellmate's​ a killer, they make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself
Am I losing myself?
Well, I miss my mom! Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare?
Ah, nobody knows

Why remember you?

Do you have the keys to the hotel?

Life is but a dream for the dead

Yeah

And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life

And if you get to Heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this

Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh, take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?
Oh, dead

Tongue-tied and oh, so squeamish
You never fell in love
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life

And if you get to Heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this

Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh, take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand?
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?

And in my honest observation, during this operation
Found a complication in your heart, so long
'Cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?

One, two, one, two, three, four
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, well, come on

Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene

It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, "You won't feel a thing"
And as we ran from the cops we laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, whoa

If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine, we'll show them what we all mean
Yeah, yeah, whoa

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

So go, go away
Just go, run away
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
Go find another way, price you pay...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!


You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you, come on!

Go

To un-explain the unforgivable
Drain all the blood and give the kids a show
By streetlight this dark night, a séance down below
There's things that I have done
You never should ever know

And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now

Who walks among the famous living dead
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
And if you could talk to me, tell me if it's so
That all the good girls go to Heaven
Well, Heaven knows

That without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone, forever now
Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on, figure out
I'm really not so with you anymore
I'm just a ghost, so I can't hurt you anymore
So I can't hurt you anymore

And now
You wanna see how far down
I can sink?
Let me go, fuck
So you can
Well, now, so you can
I'm so far away from you

Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it or leave it, you can't understand a pretty face
But you do, so carry on, and on, and on

I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me
On, and on, and on, and on
Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?

You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will

Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one, and one, and one, and one
You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will


You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
You wanna follow something, give me a better cause to lead
Just give me what I need, give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will
So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills (Fire at will)

Now, come one, come all to this tragic affair
Wipe off that makeup, what's in is despair
So throw on the black dress, mix in with the lot
You might wake up and notice you're someone you're not
If you look in the mirror and don't like what you see
You can find out firsthand what it's like to be me
So gather 'round, piggies, and kiss this goodbye
I'd encourage your smiles, I'll expect you won't cry

Another contusion, my funeral jag
Here's my resignation, I'll serve it in drag
You've got front row seats to the penitence ball
When I grow up, I want to be nothing at all

I said yeah, yeah
I said yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, I said

Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave, yeah

You better run like the devil 'cause they're never gonna leave you alone
You better hide up in the alley 'cause they're never gonna find you a home
And as the blood runs down the walls (Blood runs down the wall)
You see me creeping up these halls (Creeping up these halls)
I've been a bad motherfucker (Halls), tell your sister I'm another
Go, go, go
And I said, say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave

Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man

So get up
So get out

For what you did to me, and what I'll do to you
You get what everyone else gets, you get a lifetime, go!
Let's go!

Do you remember that day, when we met?
You told me this gets harder, well, it did
Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies

The damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I’m taking back the life you stole

We never got that far, this helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
Just you and I, your starless eyes remain

Hip-hip-hooray for me, you talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep? Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary, we could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

This hole you put me in wasn't deep enough
And I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places
To hide from me

When you go, just know that I will remember you!
If living was the hardest part, we'll then, one day, be together!
And in the end, we'll fall apart just like the leaves changing colors!
And then I will be with you, I will be there one last time now!
When you go, just know that I will remember you!
I've lost my fear of falling, I will be with you, I will remember you!22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
"They're, they're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my
They're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
Night, uh, they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're, they're these terrors
Like last night, uh, they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're, they're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat and squeezing and
It's like, as if like somebody was gripping my throat"

Some say now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part
Is letting go of your dreams

A drink for the horror that I'm in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye

And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part's
The awful things that I've seen
"Sometimes I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always
I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"
Just sleep
"Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"
Just sleep
"Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"

Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

"Falling and sometimes when I sleep and I can't
I can't ever wake up"35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hand in mine, into your icy blues
And then I'd say to you, "We could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition, too"
I'd end my days with you, in a hail of bullets

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things
We put each other through and

I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you, and we'll keep it running

But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade and nights grow
And we grow cold
Until the end, until this pool of blood
Until this, I mean this, I mean this, until the end of

I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade and nights grow
And we grow cold
But this time, we'll show them
We'll show them all how much we mean
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of every...

All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this
All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this
All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this
All we are, all we are is bullets, I mean this


As lead rains will pass on through
Our phantoms forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame
We're burning forever and ever
Know how much I want to show you
You're the only one
Like a bed of roses
There's a dozen reasons in this gun
And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever!30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
