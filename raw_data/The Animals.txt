There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one92EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Instrumental Intro
Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you, oh
Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
Oh, yes I know it
(Yeah) And I've been workin' too, baby
(Yeah) Every night and day
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta get outta this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get outta this place
'Cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know
Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
Watched his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
I know he's been workin' so hard
(Yeah) Every day, baby
(Yeah) Whoa, ohhh...

It's a hard world to get a break in
All the good things have been taken
But girl there are ways
To make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags
I'll wear sable
Someday
Hear what I say
I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent
Sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose
It ain't no use
Holdin' me down
Stick around

But baby, baby
Remember, remember
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But, some day, I'll treat you real fine
There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry
When I'm squeezing them dry?
Taking all I can get
No regrets

When I
Openly lie (ha)
And live on their money
Believe me honey
That money
Can you believe?
I ain't no Saint
No complaints
So girl throw out
Any doubt

And baby, baby
Remember, remember
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day, I'll treat you real fine
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
Don't push me
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
It's my life
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)
And I can do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want)
You can't tell me

I'm gonna do what I want

{Intro}
The rooms were so much colder then
My father was a soldier then
And times were very hard
When I was young
When I was young
I smoked my first cigarette at ten
And for girls, I had a bad yen
And I had quite a ball
When I was young
{hook}
When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young
I met my first love at thirteen
She was brown and I was pretty green
And I learned quite a lot when I was young
When I was young
{Bridge}
When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young
My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in fellow men
And I was so much older then
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young

He blesses the boys as they stand in line
The smell of gun grease
And the bayonets they shine
He's there to help them all that he can
To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
He smiles at the young soldiers
Tells them it's all right
He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight
Soon there'll be blood and many will die
Mothers and fathers back home they will cry
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile
The order is given
They move down the line
But he'll stay behind and he'll meditate
But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate
As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
In the words that he said
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
{Instrumental}
You're soldiers of God, you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell
In the morning they return
With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words
"Thou shalt not kill."
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
Servin' my time doin' the best I can
Walls and bars they're surroundin' me
But I don't want your sympathy
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I just need your tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burnin' oven
When my time is up be my rebirth
Like Adam's worth on God's green earth
My rebirth, my rebirth
Baby, yeah, mean it's my rebirth, yeah
Yeah, (Yeah!), yeah (Yeah!)
Yeah, (Yeah!), yeah (Yeah!)
Yeah, baby (Yeah!), baby (Yeah!)
Come on (Yeah!), come on (Yeah!)

(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, (Yeah!), yeah
Ice cold water runnin' in my brain
Then they drag me back to work again
Pains and blisters on my minds and my hands
From livin' daily with those canvas bags
Thoughts of freedom they're drivin' me wild
And I'll be happy like a newborn child
We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
No more walls keep your love from me
Yeah!
Can't you feel my love
Baby (Baby!), baby (Baby!)
I need you (Baby!), squeeze you (Baby!)
Yeah, come on (Baby!), nobody but (Baby!)
You do (Baby!), I love you (Baby!)
Need you, alright
I said everything's gonna be alright
And if you don't believe what I say just
Just listen, baby
Can't you feel my love?
Can't you see my skill
Can't you yell my love?
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
A little closer, yeah
I said, baby (Baby!), I need you (Baby!)
Come on (Baby!), squeeze (Baby!)
Please (Baby!), oh! (Baby!)
Lord, I love you (Baby!), I need you (Baby!)
Yeah, yeah
Right by my side
I need you here by my side
But I can't help it, baby

I'll be home soon

Well, here comes the night
Its dark shadows passing over me
I've been feeling the chill
Ever since you been gone
I'm thinking of you, girl
Wondering if you're going
To return to me
Or was it a waste of time
All we've been through
When I'm all alone
I don't have someone I can run to
Baby, I ain't got no place to go
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone
We could start again
If only you would
Reach out and touch me, baby
Like a blind man
I feel you deep down inside
I'm over the edge
I'm sorry I hurt
You so badly, girl
The things that I said
Just cannot be denied
When I'm waiting here
Hoping that someday you'll
Return to me cause, baby
Feel like I'm losing control
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone
My mind's running wild
I feel like a child
Who's been lost again
You've stolen my heart
Captured my soul
Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
It keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) Keeps
Getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn
Yeah, the night, the night
(Keeps moving on)
Yeah, colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) it keeps
Getting colder and colder
The night, keep moving on

You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky too is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue
Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start a new
And it's all over now, baby blueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ah, ah, ah

Hear me cryin', baby

When you complain and criticize
I feel I'm nothing in your eyes
It makes me feel like giving up
Because my best just ain't good enough
Girl, I want to provide for you
And do all the things that you want me to, but
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
I'm beggin' you, darlin'
Oh, oh no!

Sacrifices I will make

One thing I need is your respect
One thing I can't take is your neglect
More than anything, I need your love
Then troubles are easy to rise above

And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind
And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind

The Apollo Theater on a 125th street
The place was closed, it was pouring rain
I had a feeling I'd go there again
The taxi driver thought I was insane
Brown girl from the Bronx showed me her home
We went there by subway train
She took me there time and time again
Love was our sweet song's name

And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind
And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind

The Negro was my hero and leader
His strange tasting ways, they turned me on
I tried my best to sound just like him
When he moves, he moves like lightning
Across the world the news was flashed
The country's young leader was laid to rest
Another ending of a new beginning
Others cried some were grinning
And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind
And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind
In Central Park the children were playing
Behind the bars the tiger walked
Smiling young faces of many colours
Many young tongues were being talked
The garbage lying in the streets of the Village
Smiling face of an unknown Bob Dylan
(Do it again, man)
She was sixteen, young and so willin'
The sudden violence of a Village killin'
(And here comes the Police as usual, eh, what good are you now)

And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind
(and all ya people standing around here with your hands in your pockets)
And when I got to America, I say it blew my mind

What did you do in the services?
What did I do in the services? I was a fighter pilot. Yeah, that's right. But they didn't like me. They didn't want me. When I was sent overseas, the first thing they told me was: "um, we can't use you because we didn't send for you"
I was trained. The government paid, the government spent over $250,000 to train me as a pilot, and then after I got overseas, a general sent his adjutant down to meet our group to say that we didn't send for you and we don't want you. That's right. This is the truth, I'm telling you the truth! This is straight life but, ah, somehow we go on… We go on because we would like to think there's hope. But that's a lie, there ain't no hope and that's the truth, that's the truth baby!
That's right when I know you out of the box. (laughter) Yeah, that's right! You know the town that I was born in, we didn't have no streets? It was all dirt roads, dirt roads and poor people, nobody had nothing. Matter of fact, we used to get together to have community meals. Somebody had cabbage, somebody else had some meat, somebody else had some corn mean and we'd get together and we'd make a meal, have a community dinner. That was when we were lucky and then we'd play cards. We didn't have any signals 'cause we didn't need any. Nobody had any cars. That's right! And on the corner, on particular corners, there were accidents all the time. Most of the people who were hurt in the accidents died just because nobody came to pick them up. The ambulance never came. That's right, the ambulance never came. I've just seen many a man bleed to death, lying on the street…
There's got to be a change, there's got to be a change and there's enough people to do it! If they would get off their big fat you-know-what, and move! Because we don't have much time. There's enough people sayin', "Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame? Ain't it a shame?" Standing around. Good people, oh yeah! They all regard themselves as good people and they are full of "ain't it a shame's". And why don't people, why can't they see and why don't everybody do this and why don't everybody do that?
But if they, it's time for them to make a move, gets hands outta your pockets and go to work. Do something! Otherwise there gonna be nothing to do (laughter) Yeah, and that's funny!

(I can't tell you anything)
Tell me you want to be free, tell me, tell me
Give me some encouragement
(I feel, I feel, I feel)
And make me baby, I want, I want to make everybody to feel free with me
(I feel, I feel all wrong, you must me wrong)
Because I know but I don't care
Maybe I'm wrong
(You've got to be wrong)
I know I'm wrong babe
(You're so wrong)
I'm so very very wrong and what's good for me is good for you
(You cannot be free this way)
It's got to be, oh, free me, oh, free me
(you'll never be free this way)
I got to be free
You can't tell me that I don't feel free because I feel free
(You'll never be free this way)
I wanna be free of all this, I wanna be outta here
(You'll never be free this way)
An animal would do much to protect his young. And animal will fight to the death to protect his security and future life the way I have to live it
It's altogether something that you would definitely not understand. Nobody understands this because, take for instance Saturday night, Saturday night is a big, big experience
I think I can feel it, I think I've got it, got to be free
(is it really freedom?)
I wanna give it to you…1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Baby can I take you home
Baby let me take you home
I'll love you all my life
You can bet I'll treat you right
If you'll just let me take you home
Baby can I dance with you
Baby can I dance with you
I'll do anything in this God Almighty world
If you'll just let me dance with you
Baby let me take you home
Baby let me take you home
I'll love you all my life
You can bet I'll treat you right
If you'll just let me take you home
When I saw you baby
I couldn't ignore you
And I wanted you for my girl
And when you said 'yeah'
I just couldn't care about
Anybody else in this world alone
You smiled at me baby
And I could see my life
Planned out ahead
You took my hand and it felt so good
And this is what you said
'Baby won't you be my man
Baby won't you be my man'
Yes, I'll be your man
And I'll do the best I can
I want to be your man
That's all baby
Oh, c'mon c'mon baby
Baby, feel alright
Hey baby, its alright
So good
It's all rightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Now let's hear the story of Bo Diddley
And the rock 'n' roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom
Mississipi about 1926
He moved to Chicago about 1938
Where his name was eventually changed
To Bo Diddley
He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night
Till his papa's hair began to turn white
His pa said, "Son, listen hear, I know
You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go"
"So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
Headed out for them western skies"
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there, everybody raving
One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights
Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar
Said, "C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star"
Bo Diddley said, "Uh, what's in it for me?"
Man said, "Shut your mouth son
Play the guitar and you just wait and see"
Well, that boy made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the rock 'n' roll scene along with him
And a white guy called Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm
He changed it into handjive and it went like this
In a little old country town one day
A little old country band began to play
Add two guitars and a beat up saxophone
When the drummer said, "Boy, those cats begin to roam"
Oh, baby oh we oh oh
Ooh, la la that rock 'n' roll
Ya, hear me oh we oh oh
Ooh, la la that rock 'n' roll
Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control, such as payola
The rock 'n' roll scene died after two years of solid rock
And you got discs like ah
"Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue", and so forth
About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England
Four young guys with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah
"It's been a hard days night and I've been workin' like a dog", and so on
In a place called Richmond in Surrey, way down in the deep south
They got guys with long hair down their back singin'
"I wanna be your lover baby, I wanna be your man yeah", and all that jazz
Now we've doin' this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
We were playin' at the club a Gogo in Newcastle, our home town
And the doors opened one night and to our surprise
Walked in the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was Jerome Green, his Maraca man
And the Duchess, his gorgeous sister
And a we were doin', doin' this number
Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats
They're all standin' around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'
He turned around to Jermone Green
And he said, "Hey, Jerome
What do you think these guys doin' our, our material?"
Jerome said, "Uh, where's the bar man, please show me to the bar"
He turned around the Duchess
And he said, "Hey Duch
What do you think of these young guys doin' our material?"
She said, "I don't know
I only came across here to see
The changin' of the guards and all that jazz"
Well, Bo Diddley looked up at me and he said
With half closed eyes and a smile
He said, "Man...," an' took off his glasses
He said, "Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish...
I ever heard in my life"
Hey, Bo Diddley
Oh, Bo Diddley
Yeah, Bo Diddley
Oh, Bo Diddley
Yeah, Bo Diddley
Oh, Bo DiddleyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There's one thing I've got to say
There's got to be some changes made
No more black or white
No more left or right
I'm gonna change the world, baby
I'm gonna change the world, yeah!
I'll switch her wrong to right
You can bet your life, baby, bet your life
Hold your fire and listen mister
Don't cause no trouble for my brother and sister
Why don't you look me in the face
Either that or leave my place
I'm gonna change the world, baby
I'm gonna change the world, waah yeah!
I'll switch wrong to right
You can bet your life, baby!
Bet your life, my life yeah!
Forget about what your folks told you
Make up your mind just what you wanna do
Just accept people for what they are
Or this old world won't get very far
I'm gonna change the world, baby
I'm gonna change the world, oh yeah!
I'll switch her wrong to right
You can bet your life, bet your life!
You can bet your life
Just put your money
Where your mouth is, baby
There's gotta be some changes made
I'm gonna change this world
I'm gonna change this world, waah yeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
