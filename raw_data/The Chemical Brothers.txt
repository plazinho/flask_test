Look back and forth from the ceiling

Some day love's gonna hurt me
Turn back and soon I'll believe it

Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't think, can't...

Everything gettin' harder to find
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
See we get to the end but that's where we begin
You feel it
Mannequins say "We breakin' the mold"
Breakin' out and we breakin' the codes
Similar to the Jacques Cousteau
To the depths and you're wet
So your tank explodes, so get it out
Send your body to flight
Everybody got a target tonight
Everybody come along for the ride
All you studs and you duds and you ladies, let's fly
Grip the moment like you grippin' the earth
Feel the weight and you feelin' the girth
Now you get it, now you feelin' your worth
Feel the sound you used to make when everything used to hurt
It goes

Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
Gotta go, gotta make it in time
Brightest star gonna be the guide
Gotta get you to the other side
To where the butterflies and where the peach reside
The first five minutes for the fifteen of fame
Five seconds 'fore you're saying my name
I'm deadly sharpshooting the game
Gonna hit you and this whole execution is aim
Get together and we building a fire
Clear smoke and it's taking us higher
Hands up, everyone is one
If you see yourself making it
You're seeing the sun
Metropolis on the edge of control
They take our money, but they won't take our soul
Fuck that, ain't gon' do it no mo'
Won't do what we told and we ain't gonna fold
We go

Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't think, can't sleep, can't breathe
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins

Oh, no time to rest
Just do your best
Oh, what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you
We're only here to make you

Don't hold back, 'cause you woke up in the morning
With initiative to move, so why make it harder?
Don't hold back, if you think about it
So many people do, be cool man, look smarter
Don't hold back, and you shouldn't even care
'Bout the losers in the air and their crooked stares
Don't hold back, 'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care

Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on, come on, come on with it

Don't hold back, if you think about it too much
You may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back, you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up, c'mon keep pace
Don't hold back, put apprehension on the back burner
Let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back, get involved with the jam
Don't be a prick, hot chick be a pig
Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on with that, come on with it

World, the time has come to (Push the button)
World, the time has come to (Push the button)

World, my finger is on the button
My finger is on the button

Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fatlip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon (What it do?)
Today, we're gonna teach you some fun facts about salmon
And a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip-hop star
See anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, peep game, I'ma show you how
Put your hands to the side, as silly as it seems
And shake your body like a salmon floating up stream

I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it, you know how we do it)
Again

All my peeps spend part of their life in freshwater
And part of their life in saltwater
Wow, very interesting
We change 'round a couple of days after spawning, then we die
When I first did the salmon, all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud, "What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing The Snap"
But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, "Yo, that nigga's killing it"
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating up stream

I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it, you know how we do it)
Again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow!
My family also rely on ocean currents, tides (Uh-huh)
Gravitational pull of the moon (I'll float up stream)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?!
Wow! Who knew? (Again)
Did you know...
What?
...that I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me! Amazing... geez
Polluted water can kill both baby salmon that are developing
And the adult salmon that are on their way to spawn
Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Huh? Whoa!
Wow, hey, kids, hey, give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing Salmon Dance
Huh, what do you say? Alright
Who's hungry?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Yeeeh (oh)
Am I coming through?
Am I coming through?
Is this sweet and pure and true?

Devil came by this morning
Said he had something to show me
I was looking like I've never seen a face before
Here we go now, let's slide in through the open door

Pictures and things that I've done before
Circling around me, I'm here on the floor
I'm dreaming this and I'm dreaming that
Regretting nothing, think about that

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord, I'm shining
Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Oh, are you hearing me?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I've almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain what I've seen
I'm happy now to have seen it
To find that the images are fading away

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Oh, are you hearing me?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain the things I've seen
But now I think I see the light
Now I think I see the light

Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms on my horizons
Lord I'm shining

Oh, are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you
Oh, are you hearing me?

As I walked along
The supposed golden path
I was confronted
By a mysterious specter
He pointed to the graveyard
Over on yonder hill
I paused in cosmic reflection
Confused and wondering
Of how I came to die to die... (to fade)
Hmmm I was confused
For if I was dead
How and why did I die?
But I composed myself
And decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed on the supposed golden path
And I was confronted
By a powerful demon force
And they said it was the devil
And when he spoke his words flowed like glowing lava
From the mouth of a volcano
And I said help me lord ( to fade)
I found myself in some kind of hell
But I did not believe in a
Heaven-and-hell, world-in-opposite's kind of reality
And I gained control of myself
And I decided to press on
And as I walked along the supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear all the lions and wizards yet to come
I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high and the clouds
And voice from above did whisper some shining answer from the womb
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
As I walked along
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
As I walked along

Don't run
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control

Sometimes I feel that I'm misunderstood
The rivers running deep right through my thought
Your naked body's lying on the ground
You always get me up when I'm down

And it always seems we're running out of time
We're out of control
Out of control
Out of control

Maybe I'm just scared of losing you
Or maybe it's the things you make me do
It seems to me we both should hang around
And raise the population of this town

And it always seems we're running out of time
We're out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
But it doesn't mean we're too far down the line
We're out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control

The record player keeps on turning 'round
It could be stuck or maybe it's a sound
All the time I should be there with you
But maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth
Or maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth

And it always seems we're running out of time
We're out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control

But it doesn't mean we're too far down the line
We're out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control

Could be that I'm just losing my touch
Or maybe you think my moustache is too much
Satellite is out of control
But you and I are brothers of the soul
And you and I will come in from the cold

Out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Out of control
We're out of control
We're out of controlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
