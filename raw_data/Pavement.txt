Harness your hopes on just one person
Because you know a harness was only made for one
Don't telegraph your passes, you'll end up with molasses
Cauterized in syrup and syrup and molasses
And I'm checking out the asses, the assets that attract us
To anything that moves, we're deep inside the grooves
And it's time to shake the rations, 'cause someone's gonna cash in
The plot, it turns again, the reference starts at ten

Well, show me a word that rhymes with Pavement
And I won't kill your parents and roast them on a spit
And a-don't you try to etch it, or permanently sketch it
Or you're gonna catch a bad, bad cold
And the freaks have stormed the White House
I moved into a lighthouse
It's on a scenic quay, it's oh so far away
Far away from the beginning, the shroud is made of linen
The yearling took the purse, the goth kid has a hearse

Heartbreaking, earthquaking, Kiwis, they are home baking
Minds wide open truly

Leisure, a leisure suit is nothing
It's nothing to be proud of in this late century
And I'm asking you to hold me just like the morning paper
Pinched between your pointer, your index and your thumb
It's a semi-automatic, believers are ecstatic
You see the way they cling, the cold metallic sting
And I'm living in a coma for Donna de Varona
The harness made of hopes, the lovers on the ropes
Nun is to church as the parrot is to perch
And my heart's wide open truly14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
After the glow, the scene, the stage, the set
Talk becomes slow, but there's one thing I'll never forget
Hey, you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent
Over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
There's ways of living; It's the way I'm living
Right or wrong, it's all that I can do and I wouldn't wanna let you be

I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down

Run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
Pass me your gloves, this crime, it is never complete
Until you snort it up and shoot it down, you're never gonna feel free
Out on my skateboard, the night is just humming
And the gums smacks are the pulse I'll follow if my Walkman fades
But I've got absolutely no one, no one but myself to blame
But don't worry, we're in no hurry
School's out, what did you expect?

I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
I want a range life
If I could settle down
If I could settle down
Then I would settle down
Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins
Nature kids, I, they don't have no function
I don't understand what they mean and I could really give a fuck
The Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant bachelors
They're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
I will agree they deserve absolutely nothing, nothing more than me

Dreamin', dream dream dream dream dream5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Go back to those gold sounds
And keep my advent to your self
Because it's nothing I don't like
Is it a crisis or a boring change?
When it's central, so essential
It has a nice ring when you laugh
At the low-life opinions
And they're coming to the chorus now

I keep my address to yourself 'cause we need secrets
We need secret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –crets back right now

Because I never wanna make you feel
That you're social, never ignorant soul
Believe in what you wanna do
And do you think that is a major flaw
When they rise up in the falling rain?
And if you stay around
With your knuckles ground down
The trial's over, the weapon's found

Keep my address to myself because it's secret
'Cause it's secret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret
–Cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret back right now
So drunk in the August sun
And you're the kind of girl I like
Because you're empty and I'm empty
And you can never quarantine the past
Did you remember in December
That I won't need you when I'm gone?
And if I go there, I won't stay there
Because I'm sitting here too long

I've been sitting here too long
And I've been wasted, advocating that word for the last word
Last words come up, all you've got to waste8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Do you think it's gonna make him change?

Ice, baby
I saw your girlfriend, and she was
Eating her fingers like they're just another meal
But she waits there
In the levee washes
Mixin' cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar

My eyes stick to all the shiny robes
You wear on the protein delta strip
In an abandoned houseboat
I will wait there
I'll be waiting forever
I'm waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin', waiting
Go


Minerals, ice deposit daily
Drop off the first shiny robe
I've got a lot of things I want to sell, but
Not here, babe
You took 'em
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I sit around, I find I'm shot
Every time I turn around, my friend
Every time I sit around, my friend
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time, you're my

I was dressed for success
But success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs
At your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this

Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here

And all the sterile striking it defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon your forehead where the mist's for hire if it's
Just too clear
Let's spend our last quarter stance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again

Painted portraits of minions and slaves
Crotch-mavens and one-night plays
And they the only ones who laugh
At the jokes when they are so bad
And the jokes they're always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here

And all the Spanish candles they sold away have gone to this
And a run-on piece of mountain travels, shivers, runs, down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
We guess a guess is the best I'll do, I'll do
Last time, last time is the best time I spent10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
However you feel, whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits
Whatever you need, however so slight
Whenever it's real, whenever it's right

I've been thinking long and hard
About the things you said to me
Like a bitter stranger
And now I see the long and short
The middle and what's in between
Well, I could spit on a stranger (Pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (Pull me out)

Whatever you feel, whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
Whatever you need, however so slight
Wherever it leads, whenever it's right

Honey, I'm a prize and you're a catch
And we're a perfect match
Like two bitter strangers
And now I've seen the long and short of it
And I could make it last
Well, I could spit on a stranger (Pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (Pull me out)
Well, I could spit on a stranger, pull me out
You're a bitter stranger (Pull me out)
I see the sunshine in your eyes
I'll try the things you'll never try
I'll be the one that leaves you high, high, high4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Blind date with the chancer
We had oysters and dry lancers
And the check when it arrived we went dutch, dutch, dutch, dutch
A redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash
And this emory board is giving me a rash
I'm flat out
You're so beautiful to look at when you cry
Freeze, don't move
You've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life

A shady lane, everybody wants one
A shady lane, everybody needs one
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god
The worlds collide, but all that we want is a shady lane

Glance, don't stare
Soon you're being told to recognize your heirs
No, not me
I'm an island of such great complexity
Stress surrounds in the muddy peaceful center of this town
Tell me off in the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the over-friendly concierge
A shady lane, everybody wants one
A shady lane, everybody needs one
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god
It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god

Can you treat it like an oil well
When it's underground, out of sight?
And if the site is just a whore-sign
Can it make enough sense to me?

Pretend the table is a trust-knot
We'll put our labels down, faith is down
I'll watch a yarn of twine unravel
And you'll never get it back

It's what I want (It's what I want)
It's what I want (Twine comes down)
It's what I want (It's what I want)
Don't you know? I could make it dry, make it dry, make it dry

I've been crowned the king of it
And it is all we have, so wait
To hear my words and they're diamond-sharp
I could open it up and it's up and down

It's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg like a little dog (Ball and twine)
Don't you know that it's what I want (It's what I want)
I'll see you beg, and it makes you dry
Make me dry, make me dry, make me dry
I've been down, the king of it
It's all we have, I've been down
And I could wait
To hear the words

Silent kid, no one to remind you
You got no heel, no reels to remind you
Silent kid, don't take your pawn shop home on the road, goddamn you
Silent kid, don't lose your graceful tongue

This is the city life
(This is the city life)
Come on, let's talk about leaving

Come on now, talk about your family
Your sister's cursed, your father's old and damned, yeah
Silent kid, don't listen to the grandmother's advice about us, yeah
Silent kid, don't listen to the rain

Hand me the drum stick, snare kick
Blues call and response, I lose myself in change
Into the spotlight, ecstasy feels so warm inside

Pigs, they tend to wiggle when they walk
The infrastructure rots
And the owners hate the jocks
With their agents and their dates
If the signatures are checked
(You'll just have to wait)
And we're counting up the instants that we save
Tired nation so depraved
From the cheap seats see us
Wave to the camera
It took a giant ramrod
To raze the demon settlement

But high-ho silver, ride
High-ho silver, ride
Take another ride to see me home

Listen to me!
I'm on the stereo stereo
Oh my baby baby baby baby babe
Gave me malaria hysteria

What about the voice of Geddy Lee
How did it get so high?
I wonder if he speaks like an ordinary guy?
(I know him and he does!)
And you're my fact-checkin' cuz
(Aww...)
Well focus on the quasar in the mist
The Kaiser has a cyst
And I'm a blank want list
The qualms you have and if they stick
They will drown you in a crick
In the neck of a woods
That was populated by
Tired nation on the fly
Everybody knows advice
That was given out for free
Lots of details to discern
Lots of details

But high-ho silver ride
High-ho silver ride
Takes another ride to make me

Oh, get off the air

Oh my baby baby baby baby baby babe

Doctor's leaving for the holiday season
Got crystal ice picks, no gift for the gab
And in the parking lot, is the sedan he bought
He never, he never complains when it's hot

He foaled a swollen daughter in the sauna playing contract bridge
They're soaking up the fauna, doing blotters, I don't know which...which...which
Boys are dying on these streets

I know the medical world could knock you out
To sell the coins that you jayed last Thursday-hey
Dine by candlelight, and hold your savings tight
You never, you never know when the bridge falls apart

He spoke of latent causes, sterile gauzes, and the bedside morale
He traipse around the table talking sentences so incomplete...plete....plete
Boys are dying on these streets4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Maybe someone's going to save me
My heart is made of gravy
And the laps I swim from lunatics don't count
Open up your stockings
Pull out all the things you never wanted from room service calls
Room service calls

Open up your hands and let me see the things you keep in there
I don't want to split up fifty/fifty
That's the way we do it in this rose town
I've got all the glory in the world
I hope it doesn't floor you before you go
Room service calls in the random falls
Go!

Whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever, whenever
Whenever I feel fine
I'm going to walk away from all this, all that
Groovy groovy kitty, you little little pity
With your slip shag watching back
You skinny skinny people don't like that when you con them
Spell me
Spritzer on ice in New York City
Isn't it a pity
You never had anything to mix with that?
Listen to the tender
Behind the open chest in the hall
Room service calls
I'm blue green and cream and blue

Whenever, whenever, whenever
Whenever I feel fine
I walk the plank for you
I walk the plank, I walk the plank for you
In the dark of the capi-federal
Jacob! Jacob Javits, I'd like to thank you for everything
Primarily your glass house

Distorted ghosts
One, two, three, go!

Down in Santa Rosa and over the bay
Across the grapevine to LA
We've got desert, we've got trees
We've got the hills of Beverly
Let's burn the hills of Beverly!

Walk with your credit card in the air
Swingin' nunchakus like you just don't care
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
And when I suck your kisses, it's ours

Up to the top of the Shasta Gulch
To the bottom of the Tahoe Lake
Man-made deltas and concrete rivers
The south takes what the north delivers
You film hack, I don't use your fade

Lost in the foothills on my bike
Drinking Euro, say goodnight
To the last psychedelic band
From Sacto, Northern Cal

Well, you greet the tokens and stamps
Underneath the fake oil-burnin' lamps
In the city we forgot to name
The concourse is four-wheeled shame
And the courthouse is double-breast
I'd like to check out your public protests
Why're you complaining? Ta!
Those who sleep with electric guitars
Range Rovin' with the cinema stars
And I wouldn't want to shake their hands
'Cause they're in such a high-protein land
Because there's 40 different shades of black
So many fortresses and ways to attack
So why're you complaining? Ta!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Got struck by the first volley
Of the war in the court
Never held my serve
Send 'em a wire, give 'em my best
This ammunition never rests
No one serves coffee, no one wakes up

Stop breathin'

Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me

Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now
Write it on a postcard
Dad, they broke me
Dad, they broke me

I can see the lines open shutters
And the leaves flocked on a grid
That's what they made my hero say
Nothing gets me off so completely
Then when you put it down, ten feet down in the ground
Call it response, negative home
Stop breathin'
Stop breathin'
Breathin' for me now

A thing that recovers the doubt

And sweet I, so what do you say?

And glum looks on their faces
The street is full of punks

See those rockers with their long curly locks?
Good night to the rock 'n' roll era
'Cause they don't need you anymore
