Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day, I feel so happy
The next day, I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take
The good with the bad

'Cause each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through

Well, if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye
I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
(In love) Why must I be a teenager in love?
 
(Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun d-d-duh-duh-duh)
 know why I love you like I do (D-d-dun d-d-dah),  know why I do
(D-duh)
Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want, your love to share
I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too?
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do
I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part
When you're with me, I'm sure you're always true
When I'm away, I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
Don't know why I do
(The d-duns, d-dahs, and doo-wops continue throughout the song both upfront and in the background so mentally fill them in for yourself, thank you)
 
Oh, well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em, 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em, they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer, yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around
Oh, well, there's Flo on my left arm, and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl, well, that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt, and I show her "Rosie" on my chest
'Cause I'm a wanderer, yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, um
Oh, well, I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
A-with my two fists of iron, but I'm going nowhere, no
Yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself, um, a-fallin' for some girl
Yeah, I hop right into that car of mine
I drive around the world
Yeah, I'm a wanderer, yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around
Let's roam, I said, and go
Yeah
Oh, yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine
Drive around the world
'Cause I'm a wanderer, yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around
'Cause I'm a wanderer, yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around, around
'Cause I'm a wanderer, I'm a wanderer
 
Here's my story, sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town
Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl will leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hair and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue
Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
 
Ah, now that I love a girl and Ruby is her name
(Hear me talking now)
This girl don't love me, but I love her just the same
(What'd I say)
Oh-ooh, Ruby-Ruby, how I want ya
Like a ghost I'm a-gonna haunt ya
Ruby-Ruby-Ruby will you be mine... sometime
Each time I see you waving my heart cries
(Oh, it does Ruby)
I'll tell ya, I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
Oh-ooh, from the happy day I met you
I made a bet that I was going to get you
Ruby-Ruby-Ruby will you be mine
(Hear me talking, in time now!)
I'll tell ya...
I love this girl, I said Ruby is her name
(Believe me now)
When this girl looks at me, she just sets my soul a-flame
Don't you know, I got all kind of kisses too, yeah
And I'm gonna give them all to you
Now listen up, Ruby-Ruby when will you be mine
Gonna get you sometime!
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby-Ruby, Ruby baby
 
No one knows what I go through
And the tears I cried for you
And when I smile, it's just a pose
My heart is breaking but no one knows
Friends won't learn the truth from me
I don't want their sympathy
You go to parties, dances and shows
I still love you but no one knows
Maybe some how, some time, some where
You'll walk by and hear my prayer
My loneliness will fade away
Darling please tell me you'll stay
But if you should pass me by
I'll be hurt but I won't cry
And though my love for you still grows
I feel it's better if no one knows
 
Hey, the roof is leakin' and the rain's fallin' on my head, it won't stop
The roof is leakin' and the rain's fallin' on my head, I need a mop
I cried so hard, teardrops on my bed, drippity-drop (yes)
She packed up her bags and she moved out on the midnight train (drip drip) she's
Got no brain (drippity-drop)
She packed up her bag and she moved out on the midnight train, (drip drip) the
Girl's insane (drippity-drop)
She took my heart, tears rollin' down my drain, (drip drip) just like rain (drippity-drop)
My buddy come to see me to give me a tip, tip, tip
I said 'now listen here friend, I tell ya I'm hip, hip, hip'
'Why don't ya mind your own business, shut your lip, lip, lip'
'I know when my girl's gimme me the slip, slip, slip'
I said the roof is leakin', rain's fallin' on my head, (drip drip) oh yeah (drippity-drop)
I cried so hard, teardrops on my bed, on the floor (drippity-drop) that's what I said
Well, my buddy come to see me to give me a tip, tip, tip
I said 'now listen here friend, I tell ya I'm hip, hip, hip'
'Why don't ya mind your own business, close your lip, lip, lip'
'I know when my girl's gimme me the slip, slip, slip'
I said the roof is leakin', rain's fallin' on my head (drip-drip) drippity drop (drip-drip)
Well, I cried so hard, tears flowin' on my bed (drip-drip)
On the floor (drippity drop) on the rug, and on the wall yeah
 
In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray to you
In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you
Do you love me as I love you
Are you my life to be
My dreams come true
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight like
The moon growing dim on
The rim of the hill
In the chill still of the night
Still of the night
 
To spend one night with you
In our old rendezvous
And reminisce with you
That's my desire
To meet where gypsies play
Down in that dim café
And dance till break of day
That's my desire
We'll sip a little glass of wine
And I'll gaze into your eyes divine
I'll feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine
To hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
"Cheri, I love you so"
"You're my desire"
To hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
"Cheri, I love you so"
"You're my desire"
You're my desire
 
When she kissed me I was born and she said goodbye
And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander
She took my love, said she's not comin back
So my world and my sky was all turnin black
Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
Cause I found that place for lovers who wander
A walkin around thinkin about her
Never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it
Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
All my lovin' dreams have gone for her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander
Wo wo wo yeah, she took my love you see
Yeah, she doesn't bother me
Yeah I found that place to be
Yeah, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeah walkin around thinkin about her
I never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it
Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
All my lovin dreams have gone for her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander
Dum dum did it, dum dum did it...
 
It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happen for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where or when
 
(Pity, pity, pity, ah, ah, ooh)
Pity my arms for losing you
Pity my dreams that won't come true
But don't (don't) don't pity me
Pity my heart that's gonna break (dow, dow, dow)
Pity my kiss that you won't take
But don't (don't) don't pity me
Pity from others I have plenty of
But darlin', from you I want love
Pity the love I'll throw away (dow, dow, dow)
Till you return to me some day
But don't (don't) don't pity me
Pity from others I have plenty of
But darlin', from you I want love
Pity the love I'll throw away (dow, dow, dow)
Till you return to me some day
But don't (don't) don't pity me
(Don't, don't) pity me
(Don't, don't) don't pity me
 
Stay
Ahhhh Just a little bit longer
Please please please please please
Tell me that you're gonna
Now your daddy don't mind
And your mommy don't mind
If we have another dance, dear
Just one more time
Oh, won't you stay
Just a little bit longer
Please let me dance
Please say that you will
Say you will
Stay
Woh-oh-oh Just a little bit longer
Please please please please please
Tell me that you're gonna
Stay, come on come on come on, stay
Stay, come on come on come on, stay
 
My day begins with you
You are the sun and dew
Soon as I hold you so closely
My eyes will shine
'Cause you're mine

My day has gone, oh night
'Til you are out of sight
And if the sky is all cloudy
It turns to blue
'Cause of you

I used to face my day with a lonely heart
Wondering when my happiness would start
My day has come at last
My loneliness has passed
Now that you've told me, my darling
With me, you'll stay
Everyday
 
When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
 
Oh I am so blue when I think that you
Were once my own
My heart, how it yearns the flame still burns
But I'm alone
Not a word was spoken my heart was broken
But I still care
So I will just pray and suffer all day
And say a lover's prayer
Some day your eyes will fill with tears
When you need me
You'll think it's too late, but my love will wait
Until eternity
Some times when I'm out and having fun
My tears disappear
But deep in my heart, you're the only one
Oh answer my lover's prayer
A lover's prayer is said, my dear
So you'll be mine
I'll cry no longer, my love will grow stronger
As wedding bells chime
But that's just a dream I pray will come true
'Cause I'll still care
Where ever you are, I'll always love you
Please answer my lover's prayer
 
Oooh, ooo...
Lonely walks in the park
Counting stars when it gets dark
Every little thing I do
Reminds me of you
Window shop, dream of things
When I see engagement rings
Every little thing I do
Reminds me of you
Why was I such a fool
I broke each golden rule
But I have changed, you'll see
Since you left me
High school dance Friday night
How I'd love to hold you tight
All night long, I'm watching you
Every little thing you do
Let me have one more chance
And you'll be my one romance
Darling, let me share with you
Every little thing I do
 
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Broke my heart
We're apart
Thinks she's smart
I met a girl a month ago
I thought that she would love me so
But in time I realized
She had a pair of roving eyes
I remember the nights we dated
Always acting sophisticated
Talking about high society
Then she tried to make a fool out of me
They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Broke my heart now
Thinks she's smart now
We're apart now
Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around and breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance
She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the 5 & 10 cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's the girl next door
They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Broke my heart
Thinks she's smart
We're apart
Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around, you're breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance
She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the 5 & 10 cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's Donna next door
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
 
Well let me tell you a story
All about those blues
About a girl I was going with
Who broke my heart in two
She made me get those blues baby
Boy oh boy what those blues can do to you
Yeah
Well you took my money honey and you left me all alone with the blues
Yeah
Now it seems I can't forget you since the day that met you got the blues
Whoa
You left me crying, there's no denying I got the blues
Why, must I cry
Why, did you say goodbye
Why oh why oh why yeah why oh why oh why oh why
Friends they all heard the news
I'm suffering from the blues
Since we've been apart
I don't know, I don't know honey
I guess you'll always break my heart (?)
I got the blues
I got the blues
Over you
When nighttime starts
Like daytime breaks
I get the blues honey and I'll tell you what it takes
When the one you love
Ain't with you no more
You go to pieces baby and there's just just no cure
For the blues
Oh yeah the blues
I got the blues
Well, one more time baby
Oh, just the hope (?)
One more time
And I won't have her anymore
One more kiss honey
Oh, just a kiss those tender lips of yours
One more time
And I'll lose all of those blues
I'll lose all of those blues
Yeah, baby gone (?)
You know it's not so bad missing you honey (fade)
 
I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said I do to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you
Or no one
And so I'm through with love
I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings in
I have stopped my heart
With icy frigidaire
And I mean to care for no one
Because I'm through with love
Why did you leave me
To think you could care
You didn't need me
For you had your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
With deep emotion devotion to you
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me
It can never bring the things that used to be
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love
