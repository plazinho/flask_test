When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off?

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide
In a crowded room, it's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

So I looked for your eyes
And the waves looked like they'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always, but it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning
We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I stare into space
I'm looking for you
And I can see you
At times
I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around
See the kaleidoscope girl
In the doorway
She's looking my way
At times
I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around
Washing the dirt from your face
I'm looking for you
And I still miss you
At times
I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I remember a summer's day
I remember walking up to you
I remember my face turned red
And I remember staring at my feet
I remember before we met
I remember sitting next to you
And I remember pretending I wasn't looking

So try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might, try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

I remember your old guitar
I remember, I can't explain
I remember the way it looked around your neck
And I remember the day it broke
I remember the song you sang
I remember the way you look tonight
And I remember the way it made me feel
We'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might we'll try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

You'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

Yeah, we're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Do you know how I feel?
How I feel about you
Do you know this is real?
How I feel around you
When I see you look at me
I'm not sure of anything
All I know is when you smile
I believe in everything
Do you know how I dream?
How I dream about you
Do you know how I feel?
Do you know?
Do you know how I feel?
How I feel about you
Doesn't take much to tell
That I love, oh, I
Everyone is here
But you're nowhere near
No, you're nowhere near
No, you're nowhere near5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I followed you foolishly
You were at a smoky bar, you were out till three
Sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four
Couldn't wait for you all night
So I broke the door
I was going to spend the night, could have been okay
We were going to talk all night till I went away
Remember how you used to say, can't stay up late
A minute later and we're older now, I can't stay awake
I'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet
I remember that rusty car, like it was yesterday
Saw my brother driving by the other day
Wished that I'd go out to him, but he drove away
Saw my sister standing there accepting blame
Then I thought of how nothing ever feels the same
Another day come and gone
Don't think I can ever sing that song
Little secrets we bring along
I'm taking my time trailing behind
I thought of you
Another day come and gone
Don't think I can ever sing that song
Little secrets we bring along
Today is the day, today is the day
I think of you
Another day come and gone
Don't think I want to sing that song
It's always trouble that makes you strong
Today is the day, today is the day
I think of you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
"We proudly welcome Tony Orlando"
The state fair marquee reads
Inside 1,000 people with yellow ribbons sing
And clap on one and three

Watch him burn
He's dropping to his knees
Watch him burn
A medley, hits from Grease
Watch him burn
He never fails to please

Meanwhile in Tahoe, outside Casa Tony
Wetting rags in gasoline
A jealous Frankie Valli says, "Dawn, I want you back"
Lights a match and counts to three

Watch it burn
Reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn
Acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn
Humming "Sherry," splits the scene
Watch it burn
Reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn
Acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn
Humming "Sherry," splits the scene

We're sorry to inform you
Tony Orlando has been postponedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Since you left me I've been out with other guys
But they don't see the love light shining in my eyes
And when they want to kiss goodnight
I just can't seem to do it right
My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you
Cause when I think that someone else has won my heart
I find it's only wishful thinking on my part
And there's just nothing I can do
To get that feeling I had with you
My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you
I don't know just what my friends are telling you
But if they say I'm doin fine, it's just not true
I may run with the crowd and stay out late
But baby let me set you straight
My heart's not in it, oh no
My heart's not in it, oh no
Cause my heart still belongs to you
My heart's not in it, oh no1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What's the matter?
Why don't you answer?
What's the matter with me?
Cause it's so hard to be
Free and easy
We'll disappear completely
Hardly as I've known it's glad
Your heart is broken
And the doors are open
As you're hoping to be
There's brighter places to see
Hands need warming
Early in the morning
Hardly as I've known
A surprise
No, don't warn me
I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't
Take long
And I know, you know
It makes me sigh
I do believe
In love
No, don't warn me
I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't
Take long
And I know, you know
It makes me sigh
I do believe, I do believe
Another season
But the same old feelings
Another reason to be
I'm tired of aching
The summer's what you make it
But I'll believe what I want to believe3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
From a sugarcube

Try to be more assured
Try to be more right there
Try to be less uptight
Try to be more aware

Whatever you want from me
Is what I want to do for you
Sweeter than a drop of blood
On a sugarcube

And though I like to act the part of being tough
I crumble like a sugarcube
For you

Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I will try
Whatever you want from me
Whatever you want I'll do
I'll try to squeeze a drop of blood
Squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcubeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Late at night gazing out into the late at night
I see deep in the world 'til I open my eyes
Every day brakes screech outside my window
Those crashing cars never seem to collide

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
Catch the stars and watch as they go by

I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
It blows my mind

Every day I'm drawn to my window
I can hear it if I open my eyes
Sometimes flashing lights seem so familiar
I know I've seen them circling me at night

I've been sending signals into outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky
It blows my mind
Every day the restlessness takes over me
I can see it as I'm closing my eyes

I've been sending signals into outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
I've been getting messages from outer space
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
They spiral like a finger in the sky
(Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky)
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky, like a finger in the sky
Like a finger in the sky1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sometimes the bad guys come out on top
Sometimes the good guys lose
We try not to lose our hearts, not to lose our minds
Sometimes the bad days maintain their grip
Sometimes the good days fade
Hurts the brain to think, hurts the head to drink
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The higher we go, the longer we fly
'Cause this is it for all we know
So say good night to me
And lose no more time, no time
Resisting the flow
I heard you calling from far away
I thought I heard you cry
Having the voice to make it right
So I just cry
I felt her slipping, slipping away
Before I could even see
Tried once more, lost my grip, you were gone
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The longer it takes, the looser the ties
'Cause this is it for all we know
So say good night to me
And lose no more time, no time
Resisting the flow
Doo doo doo doo
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The stronger the wind, the faster we'll fly
'Cause this is it for all we know
So say good night to me
And lose no more time
No time
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You tell me summer's here
And the time is wrong
You tell me winter's here
And your days are getting long

Tears are in your eyes
Tonight

You tell me that you haven't
Slept in days
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired
Anyway

Tears are in your eyes
Tonight
Tears are in your eyes
Every night

Although you don't believe me, you are strong
Darkness always turns into the dawn
And you won't even remember this for long
When it ends all right
Please tell me how you'll know tomorrow
Staring at your shoes

Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Tonight1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I am just some guy barely polite
The civil tongue and I barely collide
It builds inside until I just let it fly
I am just some guy with too much pride
And all that that implies
I won't tonight
Way too snide
It’s not hard to verify
But if it's not too late
If I could protect you
Whenever you expect me to for you
When everything’s hurting
Things are uncertain
Maybe I could be that guy
But if it's not too late
If I could protect you, whenever you expect me to for you
Whenever there’s hurting things are uncertain
Maybe I could be that guy,  I'd like to try3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Let's be undecided
Let's take our time
And sooner or later
We will know our mind
We'll be on the outside
We won't care
Cause we're together
That's somewhere
And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
I can hardly wait
Let's wake up the neighbors
Let's turn up our amps
The way that we used to
Without a plan
We can play a Stones song
Sitting on a fence
And it'll sound pretty good
'Til I forget how it ends
And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
I can hardly wait
I woke up early
Couldn't go back to sleep
Cause I'd been thinking
Of where it all would lead
So I made you wake up
Said "let's take a walk"
I want to hold your hand
We don't have to talk
And there's a big day coming
About a mile away
There's a big day coming
And I can hardly wait
I can hardly waitEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Locked in a kiss
Outside eyes cease to exist
We'll shut it out (of the fist)
Spiders cease to exist
We'll shut it out

Eight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea
Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say
Dozing off, the TV drones
Huskey makes the turn and heads for home

Locked in a kiss
Outside eyes cease to exist
Flayed of the fist
Spiders cease to exist
We'll shut it out

Eight o'clock, the lights are on at Shea
Phone turned down, we've nothing much to say
Dozing off, the TV drones
Huskey makes the turn and heads for home

Someone else's date in someone else's door
There's a girl with cherry chapstick on and nothing more
It's such a lurid pose and she seems this close
But not to me
Clear as day, crawling home at night
Wondering why the girls don't look at me when I walk by
And the way they make me feel
It's way too real to believe
Night and day the swinger's on the move
Wondering what it would be like if I could be that smooth
I could think about all that I missed out
It's hard to do
Someone else's date in someone else's door
There's a girl with cherry chapstick on and nothing more
It's such a lurid pose and she seems this close
But not to me
Running around in circles all day long
Running around in circles all day longEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Come along with me to my little corner of the world
Dream a little dream in my little corner of the world
You'll soon forget that there's any other place
Tonight, my love, we'll share a sweet embrace
And if you care to stay in my little corner of the world
We could hide away in my little corner of the world
I always knew that I'd find someone like you
So welcome to my little corner of the world
And if you care to stay in our little corner of the world
We could hide away in our little corner of the world
We always knew that we'd find someone like you
So welcome to our little corner of the world1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Julie Christie, the rumors are true
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued
To the movie star and his sordid life
Mr. X and his long-suffering wife
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron
In my room with the curtains drawn
See her in the arms of Paul
Saying "I can say no more"
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity
Our hero finds his inner peace
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm
With a needle hanging out of its arm
As time goes by I know it's gonna happen
I know it's going away
Gonna take its toll, gonna take its toll
Gonna take my time
And I'm thinking about the way things are
And I'm thinking about the way things were
Thinking about Eleanor Bron
And I'm thinking about a lucky charm
And I'm thinking about the needle
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle
And I'm thinking about...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Nothing much Friday night
Pinball, the Lower East Side
Walked out of the past and into the bar

I used to think about you all the time
I would think about you all the time
Now it just feels weird that there you are

The damage is done

I feel like a kid again
My eyes are glued to the floor
I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door

The damage is done
The damage is doneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
