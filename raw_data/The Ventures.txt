I was at the bar with my drinkin' team
It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave y'all
When in walked a soldier, he was from the fuzzy naval
We were fallin', stumblin', crawlin'
Her come da police, Captain Tom Collins
And the rapper said freeze
He said, "Hands in the air and hand over your keys"
Now we did and that was kinda simple
Now here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple
I asked my friend 'bout Margarita
He said Shirley was a virgin and I wouldn't wanna meet her
So I talked to Marguarita 'cause yoh, she was flyer
I took her to the coast 'cause I wanted to screw driver
Now I'm not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, y'all
Tequila, te-te-te -tequila, tequila
Here we go again and I'm not fussin'
See I'm a French Mexican but I can get with White Russians
At the bar with a drink in my hand
In walked Jose Cuervo what was Margaritas man
I talked to the wise man cause, yoh he's distinguished
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old English
He said, "You'd better think fast
'Cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glass"
He gave me some advice and it went like this
Catch the night train and head up to 'cisco
I didn't wanna stick around
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'
Was sippin' Ice Teas on Long Island
I blacked out and the party came to a halt
'Cause I was drinking the Tequila with the lemon assault y'all
Tequila, te-te-te -TequilaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 

 
Runaway
As I walk along, I wonder
A what went wrong whit our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk on
I think of the thing's we've done
Together, while our hearts were young
I'm a walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain
A wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder, I wa wa wa wa wonder
Why a why why why why why
She ran away
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway
My run run run run runaway
I'm a walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain
A wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder, I wa wa wa wa wonder
Why a why why why why why
She ran awayway
And I wonder where she will stay
My little runaway
A run run run run
Runaway
And I wonder a where she will stay
My little runaway
A run run run run runawayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everybody's doing a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learning your A-B-C
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips, now
Come on, baby
Jump up
Jump back
Well, now, I think you've got the knack
Wow, wow
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on, come on
Do the Loco-motion with me
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Move around the floor in a Loco-motion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
(Come one)
You gotta swing your hips, now
(Come one)
That's right (do the Loco-motion)
You're doing fine!
(Come one, do the Loco-motion)
Come on, babe
(Come one, do the Loco-motion)
Hm-hm-hm, jump up
(Come one)
Jump back (do the Loco-motion)
You're looking good
(Come one, do the Loco-motion)
Hm-hm-hm, jump up
(Come one)
Jump back (do the Loco-motion)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 

 
There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
Secret Agent Man
Secret Agent Man
They giving you a number
And taken' away your name
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Oh, be careful what you say
Or you will give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Secret Agent Man
Secret Agent Man
They giving you a number
And taken' away your name
Swinging on the Riviera one day
And then later in the Bombay Alan next day
I know you let the wrong words slip
While kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Secret Agent Man
Secret Agent Man
They giving you a number

Where it began, I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring and spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along?
Hands, touchin' hands, reachin' out
Touchin' me, touchin' you
Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined to believe they never would
But now I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt, hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when I'm with you?
Warm, touchin' warm, reachin' out
Touchin' me, touchin' you
Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined to believe, they never would
Oh no, no
Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined to believe, they never would

Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be
You know she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time
You know she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad
That she's my little girl
She's so glad
She's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things you know
He buys her diamond rings
You know she said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time
You know she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad
That she's my little girl
She's so glad
She's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings
You know she said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmmEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 

 
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else
You lay staring at your ceiling through all of the night
And out to haunt you come the ghosts of your life
You bury your head in a bone colored cradle
But do you sleep with a smile upon your face?
They say into every life a little rain must fall
But your dream cloud has burst
And dripped all over your face
A sick body forms a sick mind
But you're duty bound to do what's right
Is that the oasis of light in the darkness of your life?
You can't admit, but you can't deny
A small heart, a spiteful mind
Are you good or bad you ask yourself
And do the things you do hurt the ones who care the most for you
Are you good or bad you ask yourself
And do the things you do hurt the ones who care the most for you
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else
Don't change yourself to suit everybody else...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
