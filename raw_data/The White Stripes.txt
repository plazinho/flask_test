I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says "Leave it alone"


Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says "Find a home"



I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me "Go back home"
 
Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
I can tell that we are going to be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

And we don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends
 
Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"
I said, "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"
"Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating, now"

Red hair with a curl
Mello-Roll for the flavor, and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, yeah
I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Can't think of anything to do, yeah
My left brain knows that all love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Well, I said it once before, but it bears repeating now

Fell in love with a girl

We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you


Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

I had opinions that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button


The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
Uh-oh
 
Ah, icky thump, who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well, what a chump
Well, my head got a bump when I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita looking dead
Came and said, "Need a bed?" in Español
I said, "Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar, and I don't need a microphone"

Icky thump with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there
On the stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

White Americans, what? Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's using who? What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too
Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around, and there was nobody else
Left alone, I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself
 
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
And right now, you could care less about me
But soon enough, you will care by the time I'm done

Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball, girl
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everybody in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it


Now read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
Read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
That my strength is ten fold girl
I'll let you see it if you want to before you go

Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everybody in the place to just get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it
And I can think of one or two things to say about it
Alright, listen

Alright, you get the point now?

It's quite possible that I'm your third man, girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It was the other two which made me your third
But it's my mother who made me the seventh son
And right now, you could care less about me
But soon enough, you will care by the time I'm done

Yeah, you just wait
You stick around
You'll figure it out
 
Dead leaves and the dirty ground
When I know you're not around
Shiny tops and soda pops
When I hear your lips make a sound
When I hear your lips make a sound
Thirty notes in the mailbox
Will tell you that I'm coming home
And I think I'm gonna stick around
For a while so you're not alone
For a while so you're not alone

If you can hear a piano fall
You can hear me coming down the hall
If I could just hear your pretty voice
I don't think I'd need to see at all
Don't think I'd need to see at all
Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
And every breath that is in your lungs
Is a tiny little gift to me
Is a tiny little gift to me

I didn't feel so bad 'til the sun went down
Then I come home
No one to wrap my arms around
Wrap my arms around

Well, any man with a microphone
Can tell you what he loves the most
And you know why you love at all
If you're thinking of the holy ghost
If you're thinking of the holy ghost
 
You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing, it's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

You're given a flower
But I guess that there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think that it's just me teasing you

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue

Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid turned it blue
 
When problems overwhelm us and sadness smothers us, where do we find the will and the courage to continue?  Well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend, a chance encounter with a book, or from a personal faith.  For Janet, help came from her faith, but it also came from a squirrel.  Shortly after her divorce, Janet lost her father then she lost her job, she had mounting money problems.  But Janet not only survived, she worked her way out of despondency and now she says, life is good again.  How could this happen?  She told me that late one autumn day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter, one at a time he would take them to the nest.  And she thought, if that squirrel can take care of himself with a harsh winter coming on, so can I.  Once I broke my problems into small pieces, I was able to carry them, just like those acorns, one at a time

Take all your problems and rip 'em apart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Carry them off in a shopping cart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Another thing you should've known from the start
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The problems in hand are lighter than at heart
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Be like the squirrel, girl, be like the squirrel
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Give it a whirl, girl, be like the squirrel
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
And another thing you have to know in this world
Oh, oh, ah-oh-oh
Cut up your hair, straighten your curls
Well, your problems hide in your curls

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
 
I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me to move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said 39 times that I love you
To the beauty I had found

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

I been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take 'til we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gotta worry about locking the door

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

It might sound silly
For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say 'I do' at least

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
And it's 4, 5, 6, 7
Grab your umbrella
Grab hold of me
'Cause I'm your favorite fella
All they got inside is vacancy
 
Don't you think that I'm bound to react now?
Well, my fingers definitely turning to black now
Yeah, well maybe I'll put my love on ice
Teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah

My books are sitting at the top of the stack now
The longer words are really breaking my back now, yeah
Maybe I'll learn to understand
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand, yeah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Mathematically turning the page
Unequivocally showing my age
I'm practically center stage
Undeniably earning your wage
Well maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah


Listen master, can you answer a question?
Is it the fingers, or the brain
That you're teaching a lesson?
I can't tell you how proud I am
I'm writing down things that I don't understand

Well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
 
Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

Jack, give me some money to pay my bills
All the dough I give you, Holly, you've been using on pain pills
Jack, will you call me if you're able?
I got your phone number written in the back of my Bible

Jack, I think you're pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?
You know I don't care, 'cause Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now?
Well I would, but Meg, I really just don't know how

Just say, “Jack, do you adore me?”
Well I would Holly, but love really bores me
Then I guess we should just be friends
I'm just kidding Holly, you know that I'll love you 'til the end

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

Holly give me some of your English lovin'
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and love yourself?
If I did that Holly, there won't be anything left for anybody else
Jack, it's too bad about the way that you look
You know I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot
Will the two of you cut it out?
And tell 'em what it's really all about

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

That was good (Jolly good)
Was that jolly good? (Yeah, very nice)
Jolly good, cup of tea then, Bruce
Let's celebrate
 
If you think that a kiss is all in the lips
C'mon, you got it all wrong, man
And if you think that our dance was all in the hips
Oh well, then do the twist
If you think holding hands is all in the fingers
Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and
Make sure to never do it with the singer
Cause he'll tell everyone in the world
What he was thinking about the girl
Yeah, what he's thinking about the girl, oh

A lot of people get confused and they bruise
Real easy when it comes to love
They start putting on their shoes and walking out
And singing "boy, I think I had enough"
Just because she makes a big rumpus
She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy
Take a tip and do yourself a little service
Take a mountain turn it into a mole
Just by playing a different role
Yeah, by playing a different role, oh

The boat, yeah, you know she's rockin' it
And the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' it
The boat, yeah, you know she's still rockin' it
The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it

So what, somebody left you in a rut
And wants to be the one who's in control
But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder
How the hell she can be so cold
So now you're mad, denying the truth
And it's hidden in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth
While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em
Where do you think she goes
Oh yeah, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh

The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it
And the boat well yeah know she's still rockin' it
The boat well you know she's still rockin' it
And the truth, yeah you know there's no stoppin' it

You recognize the effect and the wreck
That it’s causin' when she rocks the boat
But it’s the clause hidden in the Cardinal Laws
'bout the proper place to hang her coat
So to you, the truth is still hidden
And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but
You should know that the doctors weren't kiddin?
She's been singing it all along
But you were hearin' a different song
Yeah you were hearin' a different song
But you were hearin' a different song
 
I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I been thinking about my doorbell
Oh, well

Well women and children need kisses
Not the man in my life I know
And I been going to mystery misses
I respect the art of the show
Take back what you said little girl
And while you're at it take yourself back too
Well I'm tired of sitting here waiting
Woman what you going to do now
What you going to do about it

I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it, oh
Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I been thinking about my doorbell
Oh, well

You don't seem to come around
Point your finger and make a sound
You don't seem to come around
Knock knock since you knocked it down
Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home, yeah
Yeah, right at home, yeah

Nobody got me waiting in pain
But how come it's so easy to you
You don't strike me as the type to be callous
But your words seem so obtuse
But then again I know you feel guilty
And you tell me you want me again
But I don't need any of your pity
I got plenty of my own friends
They're all above me

And I been thinking about my doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they going to ring it
Yeah, I been thinking about my doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they going to ring it
Oh, I been thinking about my doorbell
When they gonna ring it, when they going to ring it
Yeah, I been thinking about my doorbell
Oh, well

They don't seem to come around
Push the finger and make a sound
They don't seem to come around
Maybe they they'll knock 'em down
Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home
Right at home

I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I been thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell
When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it
Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell

Oh, oh well
 
Hey, little apple blossom
What seems to be the problem?
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you
Come and tell me what you're thinking
'Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you

Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to

Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort 'em out for you

Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to

Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you

I'll fall in love with you
I think I'll marry you
 
You've got her in your pocket
And there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do?
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
And she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want

To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind, you know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her
But now you're scared, you think she's running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say;
"Don't go away"
'Cause I want

To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

Home sweet home
 
Ahhhh
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here

I'd like to think that all of this constant interaction
Is just the kind to make you drive yourself away
Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted
And leaves me standing here with nothing else to say
Completely baffled by a backward indication
That an inspired word will come across your tongue
Hands moving upward to propel the situation
Have simply halted
Now the conversation's done

There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here

I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you
That it's impossible to get along with you
It's hard to look you in the face when we are talking
So it helps to have a mirror in the room
I've not been really looking forward to the performance
But there's my cue and there's a question on your face
Fortunately I have come across an answer
Which is go away
And do not leave a trace

Ahhhh
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here

Waking up for breakfast
Burning matches
Talking quickly
Breaking baubles
Throwing garbage
Drinking soda
Looking happy
Taking pictures
So completely stupid
Just go away
Ahhhh

There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
 
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself

Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do

I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself

Movies only make me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
'Cause I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away

Well I don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself

Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose
To sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away

I just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
 
I saw you standing in the corner
On the edge of a burning light
I saw you standing in the corner

Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

You make me feel a little older
Like a full grown woman might
But when you're gone I grow colder

Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

I hear you walking by my front door
I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
I don't care what other people say
I'm going to love you, anyway

Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

I can't stand it any longer
I need the fuel to make my fire bright
So don't fight it any longer

Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

And I know that you feel it too
When my skin turns into glue
You will know that it's warm inside
And you'll come run to me
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night
 
It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

Sure I'm C.F.K
But you gotta love me
The cost no man can say
But you gotta love me

Well I'm sorry but I'm not
Interested in gold mines
Oil wells, shipping or real estate
What would I liked to have been?
Everything you hate

It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

There is a man
A certain man
And for the poor you may be sure
That he'll do all he can
Who is this one?
Whose favorite son?
Just by his action has the traction
Magnates on the run
Who likes to smoke?
Enjoys a joke?
And wouldn't get a bit
Upset if he were really broke?
With wealth and fame
He's still the same
I'll bet you five you're not alive
If you don't know his name

You said, the union forever
You said, the union forever
You cried, the union forever
But that was untrue, girl

'Cause it can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love
