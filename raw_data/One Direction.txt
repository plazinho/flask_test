I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you, from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone
To write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
 
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
(Nobody, nobody)
​Nobody can drag me down​
(Nobody, nobody)
​Nobody can drag me down​

I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark

The shell of a man who could never be his best (Be his best)
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun (See the sun)
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

All my life, you stood by me

(Nobody can drag me down)
 
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

And I been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen

The story of my life
I give her hope (Give her hope)
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
(Until she's broke inside)
The story of my life

The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life
 
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Nobody else)
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh-oh,) You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair (C'mon) gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground (Ground), it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Beautiful)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
 
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby, it will never change, baby
It will never change, me and you
 
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
I thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

So don't let me go, so don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know
We can live forever
 
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things
 
If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything
Just ask me to

Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing

Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

I can feel your heart inside of mine
(I feel it, I feel it)
I've been going out of my mind
(I feel it, I feel it)
Know that I'm just wasting time, and I
Hope that you don't run from me

For your eyes only
I show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
(When we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only)

For your eyes only, I show you my heart (Show you my heart)
For when you're lonely and forget who you are (Forget who you are)
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only

For your eyes only
For your eyes only
 
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
Let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
When we were eighteen
Oh Lord, when we were eighteen

Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love

And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
 
Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity, infinity, infinity
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity (Infinity)
Infinity (Infinity), Infinity, yeah
Infinity
 
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
(Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end (until the end)
Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between)
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (two of us)
No, nothing can come between you and I
You and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and I
 
Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya

Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do, I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Olivia

No way
 
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Yeah, yeah

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 going on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learn how
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

You know I'm always coming back to this place
You know and I'll say
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
You know

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always coming back to this place
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah
You know, and I'll say
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah
 
Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced, how we danced
1, 2 - 1, 2, 3

How we danced all night to the best song ever
(How we danced!)
We knew every line now I can't remember
(We knew every line)
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
We danced, we danced
And it goes something like this
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
(I know that I won't forget her)
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(Best song ever!)
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
 
Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Taste, on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat, where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

Lost my senses, I'm defenseless, her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour, heart devoured, lying here I count the hours

Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
No control
No control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
 
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty, and I can't see two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold, oh

Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels, that's not the way you feel

And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold
 
A week ago you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far?"
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

We had some good times, didn't we?
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

You will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind

Yesterday, I went out
To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing

We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

You will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind

I know we'll be alright, child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me
Oh yeah

You will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

Her mum calls me love, her dad calls me son, alright, alright

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright

The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright

But I know, I know, I know for sure

Couple billion in the whole wide world

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes, there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

Whatever chains are holding you back
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down
Whatever change is holding you back
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now
I wish I could be there now
 
Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody
But he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see is you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything
Right now, I can be your vice

All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watching
Your body's saying everything
I don't have to read your mind
Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off
Now we're taking it off tonight

All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

We can roll in the darkness
Let me touch you where your heart is
And if you're feeling the weakness
Well I told you, baby, that you can call me
I'll be your temporary fix, you can call me

You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night
