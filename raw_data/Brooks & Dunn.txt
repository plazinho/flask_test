When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue

There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Tellin' my poor heart
She'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Come watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon
Oh, watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm still hurtin' from the last time
You walked on this heart of mine
I can't find much to believe in
You let me down so many times

Heaven knows how much I love you
But I'm tired of holdin' on

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

There's not much chance we're gonna make it
If I'm the only one who's tryin'
You know I'm runnin' out of reasons
We're runnin' out of time

Someday, girl, you're gonna wake up
And wonder what went wrong

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're good at goin' through the motions
And all I hear are alibis
Now I get this empty feelin'
When I look into your eyes

And I don't see a love light shinin'
And I don't know what's goin' on

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you gonna miss me when I'm gone

Oh, you gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you gonna miss me
You gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, you gonna miss me when I'm gone
You'd better kiss me
'Cause you gonna miss me when I'm gone7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Yes, I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music, and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie
I've got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Oh Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie

The bartender asks me, says son what'll it be
I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, inlaws, crooks & straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My Maria
Don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her when she's around
She takes my blues away
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the sky

My Maria (Oh, Marie, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Marie, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back
My peace of mind
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when the
Skies are grey
She treats me so right, Lady
Take me away
My Maria (Oh, Marie, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Marie, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

I saw the light I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

Well, the whole town's talkin', 'bout the line I'm walkin'
That leads right to your door
Oh, how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone

I used to have a wild side, they say a country-mile-wide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around

Oh, I saw the light I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

I used to love 'em and leave 'em, oh, I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true
Baby you and me together, feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't looking back

Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
"How you keep from goin' crazy"
He said, "I'll see my wife and son in just a little while"
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

Said, "I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe"

A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, "Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died"
Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

Said, "I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see..."

I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be... no, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is
Lord, I raise my hands
Bow my head
Oh, I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to this
Than just what I can see, I believe

Oh, I...

Well, I believe

Sun comin' up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Starin' at the faces in her rearview mirror
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land
One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up goin' to prison
One just might be president

Only in America
Dreamin' in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Sun goin' down on an LA freeway
Newlyweds in the back of a limousine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is everything
She came out here to be an actress
He was the singer in a band
They just might go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been
Only in America
Dreamin' in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
And we all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America


Only in America
Where we dream in red, white, and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to

Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said: "I'm a whiskey drinking, cowboy chasing, helluva time
"I like Kenny, Keith, Alan and Patsy Cline
"I'm a full grown Queen Bee looking for honey
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."
Yeah, the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said: "I didn't come here to hear
"Something thumping from the city."
Said: "I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

Yeah, the bartender yelled: "Y'all, it's closing time."
She got this wild look on her face
An' said: "Your truck or mine
"I know a place down the road
"It's kinda funky
"Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country

Her Daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life show us all in time
Too soon God will let you know why
If you fall get right back on
The good Lord calls everybody home
Cowgirls don't cryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion
And I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery
Why I surrender
Girl, you got everything
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl, the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me (Something for me)
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

I lost her trail on a Friday night
She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go

It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Asking bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

And I know she'll be coming back
Her car is waiting right outside
But, I don't want to think about
Who's taking her for a ride
And her unpredictability
Is what I love about her best
Lord I've got to find her quick
Before she does something I regret

She's out there somewhere
Burning up the night
Somehow I've got to run her down
I'm running out of time

She looked so good movin' 'cross the dance floor
Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holdin' hands and laughin' like we used to

I've got my best smile on, but it's no disguise
It don't hide the pain in these eyes

I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part to break her heart
She walked out on me and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine

It's taken every bit of strength that I have
To keep a hurt look off my face
I can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder
At the lucky man takin' my place

Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off runnin'
Guess what I'm feelin', is what I got comin'
I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part to break her heart
She walked out on me and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine


Whoa, I did her so wrong, for so long
I turned my back on her love, now she's long gone

Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the holler
Old boys feeling like a dog on a collar
Keeping that chain pulled tight
Waiting on Saturday night
Put on the smell-good, put on Skynard
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruising back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see

Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little home grown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe

Yeah, couple cute sweet things driving a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hoping that they smile back
"Hey, Baby, what's you name?"
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change
Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hide all the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right
Do it all again next Friday night
Hillbilly Deluxe, slick pick-em-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little homegrown
A country girl cuddled up

I thought we would always be together
The love we shared was gonna last forever
Once I was your one and only
Now here I sit, Mister Lonely

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

Beneath this dark cloud you left me under
Can't sort it out so I'll sit and wonder
Tell myself, "It hurts, don't it"
Now my empty heart will be forever haunted

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

I'm a hard-workin' man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm gettin' really good at barely gettin' by

Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue-collar roots
Feel like I'm workin' overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain

I'm a hard, hard-workin' man
I got it all on the line for a piece of the promised land
And I'm burnin' my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire goin' is to outrun the wind


Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday mornin' I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothin' but business, y'all, from nine to five
I'm a hard, hard-workin' man
I got it all on the line for a piece of the promised land
Yeah, I'm burnin' my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire goin' is to outrun the wind

I can't wait to get up in the morning and do it all over again
Well I'm a hard-livin', hard-workin' manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
