Oh, when the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
Mmm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
 
You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Oh, I know (Oh, I know)
That the music's fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing (Yes, I know)
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much
You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks (You can dance)
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me
 
Ooh
Doop doop, doop doo doop
Ooh
Doop doop, doop doo doop
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those treetops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow
Then, I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells all the way
Ooooh
 
(Up on the roof)
(Up on the roof)

When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face (Up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space (Up on the roof)
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustlin' crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)


At night, the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you-a
Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)

Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Everything is all right (Up on the roof)
 
(Bo-bo) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(There she goes) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(There she goes) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Bo-bo) (doo-doot-doo-doo)
(Bo-bo) (doo-doo-doo-doo)
There goes my baby
Movin' on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where she is bound?
I broke her heart
And made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do? What can I do?
(There goes my baby) Whoa
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa
(There she goes) Yeah (There she goes)
I wanna know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing
Me for a fool?
I wonder why she left me
Why did she leave me
So all alone
So all alone?
I was gonna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side
To be my guide
I wanna know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where is my baby? (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I want my baby (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I need my baby
Yeah, whoa (There goes my baby)
Whoa (There goes my baby)
Whoa (There goes my baby)
Whoa (There goes my baby)
Whoa
 
This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

Oh (magic)
Oh (magic)
Mmm (magic)

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Oh
(Magic)
(Magic)
 
They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway (On Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (On Broadway)
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (on Broadway)

They say the girls are something else
On Broadway (On Broadway)
But looking at them just gives me the blues (On Broadway)
'Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime?
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (On Broadway)

Ha! They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway (On Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say (On Broadway)
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (On Broadway)


Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are

All up and down Broadway (On Broadway)
Ohhhhh yeah! (On Broadway)
 
Oooooooooo yeah yeah
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All it had to take me was just one look
My heart began a thumpin'
Babe you had it jumpin'
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night stand
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took
You're more than a number
Written in my little red book
Oh baby give us a chance
Don't let the small town rumours
End our first real romance
Now I admit I've loved a few
But there was never one like you
So Darlin, dont believe the things that they say
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All it had to take me was just one look

Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night stand
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took
You're more than a number
Written in my little red book
Oh baby
You gave me a sign
I threw away the numbers
Of those old flames of mine
And now they're tryin' to put you whilst
Knock me down in my girls eyes
Oh Darlin, Dont believe the words that they say
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All it had to take me was just one look
My heart began a thumpin'

Well, Saturday night at eight o'clock
I know where I'm gonna go
I'm a-gonna pick my baby up
And take her to the picture show
Everybody in the neighborhood
Is dressing up to be there, too
And we're gonna have a ball
Just like we always do
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Well, there's Technicolor and Cinemascope
A cast out of Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's always lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sitting by my side
Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Oh, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Whoa, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what picture you see
When you're hugging with your baby
Last row in the balcony?
Yeah, Saturday night at the movies
Who cares what...
 
Wonderful wonderful
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
Some kind of sweet lips
Some kind of warm eyes
Some kind of soft sigh
There's only some kind of wonderful
Oh yeah wonderful
 
Well, fools fall in love in a hurry
Fools give their hearts much too soon
Just play them two bars of Stardust
Just hang out one silly moon, oh, oh
They've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I understand
Shake the hand of a brand new fool
Well, fools fall in love
Just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams, oh, oh
They're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I understand
Shake the hand of a brand new fool
Oh, oh, they're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I understand
Shake the hand of a brand new fool
 
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
And darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Whoa, stand now, stand by me
Stand by me
Darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me
Stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Won't you stand now? Oh, stand
Stand by me
When all of your friends is gone
 
(Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey)
(Your tasty kiss thrills me so)
(Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey)
(I'll never, ever let you go)

If you wanted that star that shines so brightly
To match the stardust in your eye
Darlin', I would chase that bright star nightly
And try to steal it from the sky

'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never, ever let you go

And if you needed a dream to keep you smiling
I'll tell the sandman you were blue
And I'll ask him to keep that sand a-piling
'Til your dreams would come true

'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never, ever let you go

If you wanted a love to last forever
Then I would send my love your way
And my love would only last forever
But forever and a day

'Cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your tasty kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never, ever let you go

(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la)

Oh, hold me closer, closer and closer
Much closer while the music plays
Mmm, my little darling
Won't you dance with me?
Oh, hold me tighter, tighter and tighter
Much tighter while the rhythm sways
Mmm, put your lips to mine
While the music blends
We're no longer strangers
Now we're more than friends
So dance with me, dance with me
Closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers
When the music ends
(D-d dance with me) Whoa

Don't go
(Please stay)
Don't go
(Please stay)
If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my ar-arms
Would you walk out the door like you did once before?
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay?
Don't go
(Please stay)
Don't go
If I called out your name like a prayer in the night
Would you leave me alone with my tears?
Knowing i-i, I love you so-o, would you still turn and go?
Or would this time be different in some wa-a-ay?
Don't go
(Please stay)
(Please stay)
You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved – by your kiss
If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my ar-arms
Would you walk out the door like you did once before?
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay?
(Don't go)
(Please stay)
(Don't go)
(Please stay)
(Don't go)
(Please sta-ay-ay-ay-ay)
(Ay-ay-ay-ay)
(Ay-ay-ay-ay)

Ain't no use in staying in home
I know what you should do
Come on over to my place
Hey, girl, we're having a party
We'll be swinging, dancing and singing

Halfway down the street
So, baby, come on over to my place
Come on, we're having a party

Oh, the boardwalk's deserted
There's nobody down by the shore
And the Ferris wheel ride
Isn't turning around anymore
The heat wave and the crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes
(Sand in my shoes)
Brings memories of the salty air
(Sand in my shoes)
Oh, the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me (I've still got some sand in my shoes)
With the sand in my shoes
Oh, when the water was cold
You would tremble and hold me so tight
And we'd sit on the beach
Just to wait for the stars to come out at night
The heat wave and crowds are just old news
But I've still got some sand in my shoes
(Sand in my shoes)
Oh, brings memories of the salty air
(Sand in my shoes)
Oh, the blanket that we used to share
How we fell in love down by the sea
Comes back to me (I've still got some sand in my shoes)
With the sand in my shoes
