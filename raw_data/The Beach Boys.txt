I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

Ooh, ooh
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do)

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to

Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo

And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
We'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up

Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home

And broke in the captain's trunk

And threw away all my grits

Well, East Coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
The Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California (Girls)

A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome mannered baton
(Bygone, bygone)

A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
(Bygone, bygone)

Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
(Bygone, bygone)

The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
(Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?


Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune

The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

A choke of grief heart hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's Up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na

Just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill (deuce coupe)
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standing still (deuce coupe)

She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten 'till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy

And coming off the line when the light turns green (deuce coupe)
Well, she blows them out of the water like you never seen (deuce coupe)
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer (deuce coupe)
When I get rubber in all four gears

Well, it's been building up inside of me for
Oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why, but I keep thinking

And she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright"

Don't worry baby

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive

When she says (Don't worry baby)
"Don't worry baby

(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby

She told me "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby, nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me

I keep looking for a place to fit in
Where I can speak my mind
And I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I got brains but they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad (¿Cuándo seré?)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Un día seré, Ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Oh, ¿cuando seré? Ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out?
What's it all about?
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad (¿Cuándo seré?)

I had to prove that I could make it alone now
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me

I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

I'm a little bit scared 'cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time

My folks when I wrote them told 'em what I was up to
Said that's not me
I went through all kinds of changes, took a look at myself
And said that's not me

I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone
I would dream

I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready
I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city

I've been very aware you've been patient with me
Every time we break up you, bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you, how can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more what you want me to be
But I can't help how I act when you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong, but sometimes, I fail myself
And after all I've promised you so faithfully

I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright
By the heroes and

Heroes and villains

Oh, Caroline, no

I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true

Oh, Caroline, you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline, why?

Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then?
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?
Oh, Caroline, no4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
