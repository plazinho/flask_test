I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

It's all I wanna be, is all, a woman
For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong?

Storm in the morning light
I feel, no more can I say
Frozen to myself
I got nobody on my side
And surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right

Oh
Can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never find our way
Regardless of what they say
How can it feel this wrong?

To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

After time, the bitter taste
Of innocence, descent, or race
Scattered seeds, buried lives
Mysteries of our disguise revolve
Circumstance will decide

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you
Nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
As she walks in the room
Centered and tall
Hesitating once more
And as I take on myself
And the bitterness I felt
I realize that love flows

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Through the glory of life
I will scatter on the floor
Disappointed and sore
And in my thoughts I have bled
For the riddles I've been fed
Another lie moves over

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Wild, white horses
They will take me away
And the tenderness I feel
Will send the dark underneath
Will I follow?

Please, could you stay a while to share my grief
It's such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread
Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever

Doubled up inside
Take a while to shed my grief
Always doubled up inside
Taunted, cruel
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness, the darkness, forever12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Inside, you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere
Where they can forget

Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean
Will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares
Who dares to condemn?
All for nothing

Ooh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?

Ooh
Just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side
Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side

Done it warning, done it now
And it ain't real
Done it warning, done it now
'Cause this ain't real on this side

Ooh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise no one can see inside your view?
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone

I don't want to hurt you
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear

I'm sorry to remind
But I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream

And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet

But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds

'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair

You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searching, but I have never seen
A turning, a turning from deceit

'Cause the child rose's light
Tried to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy

'Cause the child rose's light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

I'm fooling somebody
A faithless path I roam
Deceiving to breathe this secretly
A silence, this silence I can't bear
'Cause the child rose's light
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone, oh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

We suffer everyday
What is it for?
These crimes of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you who can tell me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight
It's just a dream
We've crushed everything I can see
In this morning selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn
A stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side
And it's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart
It's only you, who can tell me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm lost, exposed
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
I can't make myself heard

No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

Full fed, yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted, I tell myself, yet I still wander
Down inside

It's tearing me apart, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)

At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
I can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream, oh, sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
All the stars may shine bright
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
Oh, how I feel so good
That I can hardly wait
To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me

All mine
You have to be

From that cloud number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
Oh, as those starry skies
As they swiftly fall
Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me
All mine
You have to be

So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die

All mine
You have to be7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's a fire
These dreams that pass me by
This salvation I desire
Keeps getting me down
'Cause we need to
Recognize mistakes
For time and again

So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, sister, breathe on

From this oneself
Testify or tell
It's fooling us now

So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, little sister, breathe on
Ah, so breathe on, little sister, like a fool2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I saw a savior, a savior come my way
I thought I'd see it at the cold light of day
But now, I realize that I'm only for me

If only I could see, you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place, no one else I face
The remedy to agree with how I feel

Here in my reflecting, what more can I say?
For I am guilty for the voice that I obey
Too scared to sacrifice a choice chosen for me

If only I could see, you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place, no one else I face
The remedy to agree with how I feel5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Esteja alerta para as regras dos três
O que você dá, retornará para você
Essa lição, você tem que aprender
Você só ganha o que você merece

Tempted in our minds
Tormented inside lie
Wounded and afraid
Inside my head
Falling through changes

Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?

Empty in our hearts
Crying out in silence
Wandered out of reach
Too far to speak
Drifting unable
Did you know when you lost?
Did you know when I wanted?
Did you know what I lost?
Do you know what I wanted?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
How can I believe this miracle
Where the wind blows dry?
Through the force of a man
Undenied by his eye?

Oh, you abandoned me, how I suffer
Ridicule breathes a sigh
You abandoned me, lost forever
Hush, can you hear

Enter and rejoice this pedestal
Where the rainbows hide
Your destiny
Mystery of all time

Oh, no time, make, or reason
Ridicule breathes a sigh
No time, make, or reason
Hush, hear him cry

No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason
No time, make or reason1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Did you sweep us far from your feet?
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a sordid dye
Too many years

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Did you feed us tales of deceit?
Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
The truth is sold, the deal is done

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come
So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Oh, if you take these things from me5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Closer
No hesitation
Give me
All that you have
And it's been so long, that I can't explain
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong
Naked
My thoughts are creeping
Too late
The show has begun
And it's been so long, that I can't confess
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong
Is it all as it seems
So unresolved, so unredeemed
If I remain, how will I know
Cause it's been so long, that I can't be sure
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I can't hold this day anymore
Understand me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly

Oh, this uncertainty

Recognise me anymore

What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
