We're all going on a summer holiday
No more working for a week or two
Fun and laughter on our summer holiday
No more worries for me or you
For a week or two
We're going where the sun shines brightly
We're going where the sea is blue
We've seen it in the movies
Now let's see if it's true
Everybody has a summer holiday
Doing things they always wanted to
So we're going on a summer holiday
To make our dreams come true
For me and you
We're going where the sun shines brightly
We're going where the sea is blue
We've seen it in the movies
Now let's see if it's true
Everybody has a summer holiday
Doing things they always wanted to
So we're going on a summer holiday
To make our dreams come true
For me and you
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmmEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The young ones
Darling we're the young ones
And young ones shouldn't be afraid
To live, love
While the flame is strong
'Cause we may not be the young ones very long
Tomorrow
Why wait until tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow sometimes never comes
So love, me
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing while we're young
Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this
I need you and you need me
Oh my darling can't you see
Young dreams
Should be dreamed together
Young hearts shouldn't be afraid
And some day when the years have flown
Darling, then we'll teach the young ones
Of our own(x2)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Bye, bye, baby doll, I find you too high class
I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass
This pink champagne and caviar are all very grand
But I prefer just rocking to a rock 'n' roll band
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby
High Class Baby
Well, go and find a rich man, put your arms around him
Tell him that you love him and go out and drown him
May be wich you're riches, you'll find true happiness
But I'll stay here a-rocking, 'cause it's what I love the best
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby

You've got sable mink and a Cadillac
Believe me honey, you're taking things too far
You can't find a true love with a sack of gold
Come on and love me, little honey, before you grow too old
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoes
Honey, I soon lose the blues, wait until you hear the news
You're still my own true, my very own true
You're still my high class baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
(High class baby, high class baby) Don't be mean to me, baby

When the girl in your arms
Is the girl in you heart
Then you have got everything
When you are holding the dream
You have been dreaming you would hold
You're as rich as a king
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
Make her yours for evermoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walkin', talkin', livin' doll
Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk, so no big hunk
Can steal her away from me
Got myself a cryin', talkin', sleepin', walkin', livin' doll
Gotta do my best to please her, just cos she's a livin' doll
Got a rovin' eye and that is why she satisfies my soul

Oh darling, will our love be like an evergreen tree
Stay ever green and young as the seasons go
Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree
Bloom in the summer's sun and the winter's snow
On every branch will blossom
Dreams for me and you
Our tree of love will stay ever green
If our hearts stay ever true
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
On every branch will blossom
Dreams for me and you
Our tree of love will stay ever green
If our hearts stay ever true
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
On the evergreen tree

Well, I never felt more like singing the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love, baby, you got me singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause everythin's wrong, and nothin' ain't right
Without you, you got me singing the blues
Well, the moon and stars no longer shine
And the dream is gone that I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But cry over you
Well, I never felt more like runnin' away
Didn't want to go, but I couldn't stay
Without you, you got me singing the blues
Ooh, the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone that I thought was mine
Well, there's nothin' left for me to do
But cry over you
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause everythin's wrong, and nothin' ain't right
Without you, you got me singing the blues
You got me singing the blues
You got me singing the blues
You got me singing the bluesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If some guy tells you I don't care
And tells you lies while I'm not there
Don't talk to him
And if he tells you I'm untrue
Then darling here's what you must do
Don't talk to him
And if he tells you I've been seen
Walking round with Sue and Jean
He's lying again
Do anything that you want to
But darling this I beg of you
Don't talk to him
If you hear the words he has to say
He'll break your heart
Let your love for me prove strong while we are far apart
So just remember what I say
And trust in me while I'm away
For I'll be true
And just remember my true love
Is brighter than the moon above for only you
And if this guy should try to say
My love for your is only play, merely a whim
Just close your eyes and count to ten
Think of me again
But don't you talk to him

What is there to say
What is there to do
You took another
For your lover
What is there to say or do
Since i lost you
Where is there to go
Who is there to see
Where can i run to
For a new heart
What is there to say or do
Since i lost you
Me and my shadow
Mopin' around
Wond'rin' what to do
He says to leave her
I can't believe her
When she tells me i must go
How much can i stand
Will it never end
My heart is broken
Yes that's true
But, what is there to say or do-oo-oo
Since i lost youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If you hear somebody knockin' on your door
If you see somebody crawlin' across the floor
Baby it'll be me, I'll be lookin' for you
And if you see somebody climbin' up a telegraph pole
If you find a new lump in your sugar bowl
Baby it'll be me, I'll be looking for you
I'm gonna look in the mountains
Down in the deep blue sea
I'm gonna look in the forest
And look and look in every tree
If you find a new bait on your fishin' hook
And if you find a funny face in your comic book
Baby it'll be me I'll be lookin' for you
(Spoken: Well, keep on lookin')
I'm gonna look in the cities
Where the lights are blue
Gonna search the country side
And the haystacks too
Well if you see something shootin' out across the stars
If you see a rocket ship in it's way to Mars
Baby it'll be me
Yeah I'll be lookin' for you
I'll be lookin' for you
Well, I'll be lookin' for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sometimes when I look from my window I’ll see
A beautiful stranger who beckons to me
I know where she comes from
But where does she go
One day I’ll go with her and then I shall know
Each day when she passes at ten twenty-three
Her eyes find my window
She’s smiling at me
I run to the stairs
But too late she is gone
She’ll back tomorrow at a quarter past one
On Sundays I miss her
She doesn’t come back
I don’t know the reason
Guess I’ll never know why
She may go away for the weekend
But then she’ll come back on Monday at twenty past ten
The week passes quickly and often I’ll see
That beautiful stranger who beckons to me
She stands on an island surrounded by sea
And the smile on her lip says fly B.O.A.CEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I was just a little baby I didn't have many toys
But my mama used to say: "Son, you've more than other boys
Now you may not be good looking, and you may not be too rich
But you'll never ever be alone, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
Now I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play that game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is akiss my chips
And I know I'm 'bout to win, yeah, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Imagine a still summer's day
When nothing is moving, least of all me
I lay on my back in the hay
The warm sun was soothing, it made me feel good
The day I met Marie
The sound of her whisper "hello"
Came tiptoeing softly into my head
I opened my eyes kind of slow
And there she was smiling, it made me feel good
The day I met Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze
I remember her kiss, so soft on my brow
And the way that she said:
"Baby, go to sleep now
Baby, go to sleep now"
I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from but I still feel good
To think I've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breezeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
They say, I'll love again someday
That truer love will come my way, the next time
But after you there'll never be a next time for me
They say, that I'll find happiness
In someone else's warm caress, the next time
I'll soon forget your kiss
And heartaches such as this, will just be ancient history
They say, that I'm a fool to weep
And I won't go on losing sleep, the next time
That someone else will mend the heart, you've broken in two
But how can I fall in love the next time?
When I'm still, so very much in love with you
They say, that I'm a fool to weep
That I won't go on losing sleep, the next time
That someone else will mend the heart, you've broken in two
But how can I fall in love the next time?
When I'm still, so very much in love with you
When I'm still, so very much in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I was young my father said
"Son I have something to say"
And what he told me I'll never forget
Until my dyin' day
He said "Son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you be a bachelor boy until your dyin' day"
When I was sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as could be
But I remember'd just in time
What my daddy said to me
He said "Son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you be a bachelor boy until your dyin' day"
As time goes by I probably will
Meet a girl and fall in love
Then I'll get married have a wife and a child
And they'll be my turtle doves
But until then I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay
Happy to be a bachelor boy
Until my dyin' day
But until then I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay
Happy to be a bachelor boy
Until my dyin' dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've had many times, I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I'd had my share of that
But these miss you nights
Are the longest
Midnight diamonds stud my heaven
Southward burning like the jewels that eye your place
And the warm winds that embrace me
Just as surely kissed your face
Yeah, these miss you nights
They're the longest
(How I missed you) How I missed you, I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man and cold daylight buys the pride I'd rather sell
(All my secrets) All my secretes are a wasted affair
You know them well
Thinking of my going
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind
Looking windward, for my compass
I'll take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights
Are the longest
(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killing time
(Play down) Play down all dreams and themes once remembered
It's just the same, this miss you game
Yet these miss you nights
Are the longestEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
