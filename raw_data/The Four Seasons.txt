Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under
(Oh, what a night)
Oh, I got a funny feeling
When she walked in the room
And my, as I recall
It ended much too soon

(Oh, what a night)
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush
Like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around
And takin' my body under

(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do
(Oh, what a night)
Do do do, do do, do do do do...8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

(Beggin') beggin' (You)
Put your loving hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby

Riding high when I was king
Played it hard and fast
'Cause I had everything
You walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Begging) beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby

I need you to understand
That I tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell
Used to be
Shadow of my life
Is hanging over me
Broken man without a throne
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

(Beggin') I'm beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin'
Put your loving hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Won't you give your hand out, babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The day you left me
An angel cried

The sun had faded and died
No one knew the reason why but me
That cloudy day, you went away
The clouds had filled up the skies
Like the tears that filled my eyes, lonely me
That cloudy day, you went away

Then raindrops fell (Raindrops fell)
Down from the sky
The day you left me
An angel cried
An angel cried

(My God, an angel knows)
Yes, she knows
Yes, she knows you hurt me so
She knows the reason why

The raindrops fell (Raindrops fell)
Down from the sky
The day you left me
An angel cried
An angel cried
Woah-oh, she cried
That cloudy day (That cloudy day)
You went away (You went away)
An angel cried

Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
My girl said good-bye (my oh my)
My girl didn't cry (I wonder why)

(Silly boy) But she said to my surprise
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
Baby I was cruel (I was cruel)
Baby I'm a fool (I'm such a fool)

Walk like a man
Oh, how you tried to cut me down to size
Tellin' dirty lies to my friends
But my own father said "Give her up, don't bother
The world isn't comin' to an end"
(He said)
Walk like a man, talk like a man
Walk like a man my son
No woman's worth crawlin' on the earth
So walk like a man, my son
Bye bye baby, I don't-a mean maybe
Gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be cryin' on account of all your lyin'
Oh yeah, just look who's laughin' now
(I'm gonna)
Walk like a man, fast as I can
Walk like a man from you
I'll tell the world "forget about it, girl"
And walk like a man from you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Beware of his promise
Believe what I say
Before I go forever
Be sure of what you say

So he paints a pretty picture
And he tells you that he needs you
And he covers you with flowers
And he always keeps you dreamin'
If he always keeps you dreamin'
You won't have a lonely hour
If a day could last forever
You might like your ivory tower

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around

Beware of his promise (Bah duh duh duh duh)
Believe what I say (Bah duh duh duh duh)
Before I go forever (Bah duh duh duh duh)
Be sure of what you say
For the words may come too easy
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
And goodbye may come too quickly
If you really think he loves you
If you really think he loves you
You would give your love so sweetly
If that day could last forever
You would fall in love completely

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yes the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you foundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
(Hand-me-down) When she was just a kid her clothes were hand-me-down
(Hand-me-down) They always laughed at her when she came into town
Called her rag doll, little rag doll
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace
Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
(Sad rag doll) I'd change her sad rags into glad rags if I could
(If I could) My folks won't let me 'cause they say that she's no good
She's a rag doll, such a rag doll
Though I love her so, I can't let her know
Ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh (Ooh-oo-ooh)
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh (Rag doll, ooh)

I solve my problems and I see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word
They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand, it's just a crying shame
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel
Grease is the word
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a mеaning
Grease is the timе, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling
This is a life of illusion
Wrapped up in trouble
Laced with confusion
What are we doing here?
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are (be who we are)
Grease is the word
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling
(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling
Grease is the word

Pretty as a midsummer's morn
They call her Dawn
Dawn
Go away I'm no good for you
Oh Dawn
Stay with him, he'll be good to you
Hang on
Hang on to you
Think
What a big man he'll be
Think
Of the places you'll see
Now think what the future would be with a poor boy like me
Dawn go away
Please go away
Although I know
I want you to stay
Dawn go away
Please go away
Baby, don't cry
It's better this way
Ahh, ahh, ah
Ohh-ohh-oh
Dawn
Go away back where you belong
Girl we can't
Change the places where we were born
Before you say
That you want me
I want you to think
What your family would say
Think
What your throwing away
Now think what the future would be with a poor boy like me
Meee-ee
Dawn
Go away I'm no good for you
Dawn
Go away I'm no good for you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You've only given me a flower
I wish I had the whole bouquet
If I should ask you for an hour
Is there a chance that you would stay
And maybe spend the day?

Can’t seem to stop myself from caring
At least until the day I die
And if, by chance, you see me staring
You know I'm always gonna try
Though you may pass me by

Oh, you're a song (You’re a song that I can't sing)
You're a word (You're a word that I can't say)
You're a song

Sometimes, I find myself believing
That I could spend the night with you
But some vibrations are deceiving
Though you may feel the way I do
You'd never see it through
Oh, you're a song (You’re a song that I can’t sing)
You're a game (You’re a game that I can't play)
You're a song
You're a song (You’re a song that I can't sing)
You're a game (You're a game that I can't play)
You're a song
You're a song (You're a song that I can't sing)

I'm workin' my way back to you babe
With a burnin' love inside
Yeah I'm workin' my way back to you babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away
Paying every day
When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
But how I cried over losin' you
See me down and out
But I ain't about to go livin' my life without you
For every day, I made you cry
I'm payin' girl, till the day that I die
I'll keep workin' my way back to you babe
With a burnin' love inside
I'm workin' my way back to you babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away
Been payin' every day
I used to love to make you cry (Make you cry)
It made me feel like a man inside (Baby, baby)
But if I'd been a man in reality (Cry, cry)
You'd still be here babe, lovin' me
Now the nights are long and lonely
And I ain't too strong babe, I just miss you so
And you're too proud, you won't give in
But when I think, about all I could win
I keep workin' my way back to you babe
With a burnin' love inside
Mmm, I'm workin' my way back to you babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away
Been payin' every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm workin' my way back to you babe
With a burnin' love inside
Ooh, I'm workin' my way back to you babe
And the happiness that died
Oh, how I cried
Workin' my way back to you babe
With a burnin' love inside
I'm workin' my way back to you babe1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If you hate me after what I say
Can't put it off any longer
I just gotta tell you anyway
Bye Bye Baby Goodbye
Bye Bye Baby don't make me cry
Your the one girl in town I'd marry
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free
I wish it could be
I could love you but why begin it
Cause there ain't any future in it
She's got me and I'm not free
So Bye Bye Baby Baby Goodbye
Bye Bye Baby don't make me cry
Guess I will never know you better
Wish I knew you before I met her
Gee how good you would be for me
Should have told you that I can't linger
There's a weddin' ring on my finger
She's got me and I'm not free
So Bye Bye Baby Baby Goodbye
Bye Bye Baby don't make me cryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There ain't no good in our goodbye-in'
True love takes a lot of tryin'
Oh, I'm cryin'
Let's hang on to what we got
Don't let go girl, we got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on
To what we got 
You say you're gonna go and call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
(Breakin' up) I wish you never said it
(Breakin' up) No, no, we'll both regret it
That little chip 'o diamond on your hand
Ain't a fortune, baby, but you know it stands
(For your love) A love to try and bind us
(Such a love) We just can't leave behind us
Baby (don't you go) Baby (oh no no)
Baby (think it over and stay)
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
I'd go to any price to get in good with you
(Patch it up) Give me a second turn
(Patch it up) Don't cool off while I'm burnin'
You got me cryin', dyin' at your door
Don't shut me out, open your arms for
(Open up) Your arms I need to hold
(Open up) Your heart, oh girl, I told you

You're home again, I'm glad you kept the key
Been waiting here, it seemed a million years to me
But hush now I know you're all cried out
It's all right inside, I've had no doubt
About your love for me
I can see behind the tears
I'm certain of the way we feel
And given time the hurt will heal
I need you, I think I always will
From time to time you play around
But I love you still
You tried them all, at ev'rybody's beck and call
Maybe you resist them all
When I tell you how I missed you
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything
You can't help the things you do
Home again so won't you close the door
Stay here with me and
We'll forget what's gone before
Just hold me tight
Our love is gonna make it right
Put shadows way beyond recall
The ghost has almost gone
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything
You can't help the things you do1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, I can see
There ain't no room for me
You're only holding out
Your heart in sympathy
If there's another man
Then girl, I understand
Go on and take his hand
And don't you worry 'bout me

I'll be blue (Baby blue)
And I'll be crying, too
(Crying, too, crying, too)
But girl, you know I only want
What's best for you
What good is all my pride
If our true love has died?
Go on and be his bride
And don't you worry 'bout me

I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy
When you're gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow, I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me
Ooh, baby
(Baby blue)
(Crying, too, crying, too)
(Baby, worry 'bout me)

Sweetie pie
Before you say goodbye
Remember if he ever
Leaves you high and dry
Don't cry alone in pain
Don't ever feel ashamed
If you want me again
Just don't you worry 'bout me

I love you (Loving you)
No matter what you do
(Loving you, loving you)
I'll spend my whole life waiting
If you want me to
And if this is goodbye
You know I'd rather die
Than let you see me cry
'Cause then you'd worry 'bout me
I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy
When you're gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow, I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me

I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy
When you're gone
I'll always think of you
