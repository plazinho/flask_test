Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two

Time to get it
Before you let it get to you
Here he comes now
Stick to your guns and let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes
I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you
Now I see it
I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you
And it's not clear while you make the way

Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

It better work out
I hope it works out my way
Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head
It takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now

You better look it
We're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero
We paint a zero on his hand

We know it's down
We know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is round it
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and cooze

It's time to go round
A one man showdown teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now
And back on the road on the riot trail16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over, she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in
Her light eyes were dancing, she is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer saying, "I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home."

My future is static
It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I ripped your heart out from your chest
Replaced it with a grenade blast

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate

The Firefighters hose me down
I don't care, I'll burn out anyhow
It's four-alarm, girl, nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me, huh-huh-huh-yeah


You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
Incinerate
The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at your feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery, oh


You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover burning mind

Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me
Hey, what are you waiting for? Feeding, feeding me?
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in the mirror and I'm bigger in every way

She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

I'm in heaven now, I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye Downey, hello Janis
Hello Dennis, Elvis, and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end

Dreaming, dreaming of how it was supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way

She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
Hey mom, look I'm up here, I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad, the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said "Honey, you look so under-fed"


Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes and I'm bigger in every way

She said, "You aren't never going anywhere"
"You aren't never going anywhere"
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Goodbye Richard, gotta go now
I'm finally on my own, but Dan's got a gig
Keep the love lights glowing, little girl's got the blues
I can still hear mama say
"Honey, don't let it go to your head"2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ah...
Ah...

Long ago
And oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really there
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do


Loneliness
Is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again
What to say
To make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
10, 20, 30, 40
Tell me that you wanna hold me
Tell me that you wanna bore me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to slowly
Tell me that you're burning for me
Tell me that you can't afford me
Time to tell your dirty story
Time turning over and over
Time turning four leaf clover
Betting on the bull in the heather
10, 20, 30, 40
Tell me that you wanna scold me
Tell me that you adore me
Tell me that you're famous for me
Tell me that you're gonna score me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to sorely

Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls, they're playing on a jelly roll
Time to take a ride, time to take it in a midnight eye
And if you wanna go, get on below

Pinking out the day
Dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love
It's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road
And tell the story of the jelly rolling
Dirty boots are on
Hi di ho

Pinking out the black
Dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue
Now it's undone
I got some dirty boots
Yeah, dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby
Dirty boots
Hey

I can never forget you
The way you rock the girls
They rule the world and love you
A blast in the underworld
I stick a knife in my head
A-thinking 'bout your eyes
But now that you been shot dead
I got a new surprise

But I been waitin' for you just to say
The zoftig chick is mine
But all I know is you got no money
But that's got nothing to do with a good time

Can you forgive the boy who
Shot you in the head
Or should you get a gun and
Go and get revenge?
A 100% of my love
Up to you true star
It's hard to believe you took off
I always thought you'd go far
But I been around the world a million times
And all you men are slime
It gone to my head
Goodbye I am dead
Wastewood rockers is time for crime
Hey

Time takes its crazy toll
And how does your mirror grow?
You better watch yourself when you jump into it
'Cause the mirror's gonna steal your soul

I wonder how it came to be my friend
That someone just like you has come again
You'll never, never know how close you came
Until you fall in love with the diamond rain

Throw all his trash away
Look out, he's here to stay
Your mirror's gonna crack when he breaks into it
And you'll never, never be the same

Look into his eyes and you can see
Why all the little kids are dressed in dreams
I wonder how he's gonna make it back
When he sees that you just know it's make believe

Blood crystallized to sand
And now I hope you understand
You reflect into his looking glass soul
And now the mirror is your only friend
Look into his eyes and you will see
That men are not alone on the diamond sea
Sail into the heart of the lonely storm
And tell her that you'll love her eternally


Time takes its crazy toll
Mirror fallin' off the wall
You better look out for the looking glass girl
'Cause she's gonna take you for a fall

Look into his eyes and you shall see
Why everything is quiet and nothing's free
I wonder how he's gonna make her smile
When love is running wild on the diamond sea

To the extent that I wear skirts and cheap nylon slips
I've gone native
I wanted to know the exact dimensions of hell
Does this sound simple? Fuck you!
Are you for sale?
Does "Fuck you" sound simple enough?
This was the only part that turned me on
But he was candy all over

Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more

I grew up in a shotgun row sliding down the hill
Out front were the big machines
Steel and rusty now, I guess
Out back was the river
And that big sign down the road
That's where it all started
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more and more and more and more
Come on down to the store

Sunday comes alone again
A perfect day for a quiet friend
And you
You will set it free
I see new morning 'round your face
Everybody says it's another phase
And now
Now its come to me
See the magic in your eyes
I see it come as no surprise
And you
You turn your eyes away
Yeah you
You turn it all away
I guess its true its never too late
Still I don't know what to do today
Oh why
Can't I set you free?
Will you
Do the same for me?
Sunday comes and Sunday goes
Sunday always seems to move so slow
To me
Here she comes again
A perfect ending to a perfect day
A perfect ending what can I say
To you
Lonely Sunday friend
With you
Sunday never ends2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Snake in it, jack into the wall
TV amp on fire blowing in the hall
Gun your sled, close your peeping toms
Turbo organizer cranking on the knob

You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket

Hit the power, psycho helmets on
You got to splice your halo, take it to a moon
Nymphoid clamor fueling up the hammer
You got to fake out the robot and pulse up the zoom

You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket

Can't forget the flashing
Can't forget the smashing
The sending and the bending
The atmosphere re-entry
You gotta have the time
Got another in your mind
Got your heart injected
And you got your soul aligned
You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocketEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You're perfect in the way
A perfect end today
You're burning out their lights
And burning in their eyes
I love you, Sugar Kane
A coming from the rain
Oh, kiss me like a frog
And turn me into flame
I love you all the time
I need you 8 to 9
And I can stay all night
Your body shining

And I know
There's something down there, Sugar Soul
Back to the cross, a twisted lane
There something down there, Sugar Kane

I'm back again in love
I'm back again a dove
Where'd you get your light
Your smiling sugar life
Another lovers day
Another cracked up night
Every night, I say
The light is coming
And I know
There's something down there, Sugar Cone
Back to the cross, a twisted lane
There's something down there, Sugar Kane

Hey angel come and play
And fly me away
A stroll along the beach
Until you're out of time
I love you, Sugar Kane
A crack into the dream
I love you, Sugar Kane
I love you, Sugar Kane

My friend Goo has a real tattoo
She always knows just what to do
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care
What she does best is stand and stare
She can play the drumset too
And the boys say: "Hey Goo what's new?"
My friend Goo just says: "P.U."
My friend Goo just says: "P.U."
I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
She likes to wear green underwear
And lays down almost anywhere
She doesn't have nothing to do

Ready? Go, 1, 2, 3, 4

If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl

Remember mother?
We were close
Very, very close
(Sha la la) You taught me how to fit it good
(Sha la la) Flow down life you understood
(Sha la la) Curl my hair and eye lash
(Sha la la) Hitch my cheeks and do my lips
(Sha la la) Swing my hips, just like you
(Sha la la) Smile and behave
(Sha la la) A circle of perfection, it's what you gave
(Sha la la) Then one day, I met a guy
He stole my heart, no alibi
(Sha la la) He said: "Romance is a ticket to paradise"
(Sha la la) Momma, I'm not too young to try
(Sha la la) We kissed, we hugged
We were close
Very, very close
(Sha la la) We danced in the sand
And the water rose - higher and higher
(Sha la la) Until I found myself floating - in the sky
I'm sorry mother, I'd rather fight
Than have to lie
If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl

Little trouble girl (What you doing?)
Little trouble girl (Cross my heart and hope to die)
Little trouble girl (I can not tell a lie)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)
Little trouble girl (uh-huh)

When you feel the spiral turning for you alone
And you feel so heavy that you just can't stop it
When this sea of madness turns you into stone
Picture of your life shoots like a rocket
All the time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you
From nowhere to nowhere
Cut together, cutting through

I'm island-bound, a mote inside my eye
And I can't see you breathing as before
I am airless–a vacuum child
And I can't stand to reason at your door
In this time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it'll all cut through you
From nowhere to nowhere
Cut together
I'm down in the daytime out of sight
Coming in from dreamland I'm on fire
I can see it's all been here before
Dream a dream that lies right at your door

When the seasons circle sideways out of turn
And words don't speak just fall across the carpet
You're just in time to watch the fires burn
It seems a crime but your face is bright you love it
All the time

(Achoo. Branca-fest.)

I can't see anything at all, all I see is me
That's clear enough, that's what's important
To see me
My eyes can focus, my brain is talking
It looks pretty good to me
My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful
It looks pretty good to me

Sometimes I speak, tonight there's nothing to say
Sometimes we freak and laugh all day

Hold these pages up to the light
See the jackknife inside of the dream
A railroad runs through the record stores at night
Coming in for the deep freeze

(Mary) A simple word
Are you there in the cold country?
Your eyes so full, your head so tight
Can't you hear me?
Remember our talk, that day on the phone?
I said I was the door, and you were the station
With shattered glass and miles between us
We still flew away in the conversation
My cup is full and I feel okay
The world is dull, but not today

She thinks she's a goddess
She says she'll talk to the spirits
I wonder if she can talk to herself
If she can bear to hear it

This is Eric's trip
We've all come to watch him slip
He's slipping all the way to Texas
Can you dig it?

I see with a glass eye, the pavement view
A shadow forming, across fields rushing
From me to you
We tore down the world, we put up four walls
I breathe in the myth
I'm over the city, fucking the future
I'm high and inside your kiss

We can't see clear
But what we see is alright
We make up what we can't hear
Then we sing all night
Scattered pages and shattered lights
See the jackknife, see the dream
There's something moving over there to the right
Like nothing I've ever seen2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Let's go walkin' on the water
Come all the way, please
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

No need to be scared
Let's jump into the day
I wanna know
I think I oughta go

Close your eyes and make believe
You can do whatever you please
I wanna know
I think I better go

Let's go walkin' on the water
Now you think I'm Satan's daughter
I wanna know
Please let me go

Just too quick
Now I think I'm gonna be sick
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
I'm trying for the future
It's funny that way
I wanna know
I wanna know

I took a look into the hate
It made me feel very up to date
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

Hold me tight, down on my knees
So I don't go burning 'cross the breeze
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

Burning 'cross the breeze
Burning 'cross the breeze
Blowing 'cross the breeze
