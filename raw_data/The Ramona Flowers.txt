The high tide, a sinking pier
We’re washed up and holding
We can rewrite another year
And drown our fears
When they told us not to misbehave
When they told us it was just a phase
We were laughing as they made the call
With our backs against the wall
Steady now steady now
Just don’t push this to far
Build it up burn it down
Just like when we were young
Street fights and crowded rooms
All in and losing
And that thing you said when we first met
If you remember
They can all forget
When they told us not to misbehave
When they told us it was just a phase
We were laughing as they made the call
With our backs against the wall
Steady now steady now
Just don’t push this to far
Build it up burn it down
Just like when we were young
(Just like when we were young)
(Just like when we were young)
Breathe in slow it down
We’ll get lost and we won’t turn around
Leave it we’ll ride it out
We’ll get lost and we won’t turn around
With our backs against the wall
Steady now steady now
Just don’t push this to far
Build it up burn it down
Just like when we were young
(Just like when we were young)
(Just like when we were)
 
Every time I see you
I forget why
We decided that
We should live separate lives
Every time I see you
I try to tell you how I feel
My lips move
We just argue all night
Every time I see you
You tell me what I want, but you’ve
Forgotten I know you
Better than anyone
We’re no fairytale
That ain’t what I’m saying
Stop twisting my words
 I'm done
After all these years
You won’t talk or look at me
Is this what it’s come to?
We’re like strangers in a waiting room
After all the tears
You won’t talk or look at me
Is this what it’s come to?
We’re like strangers in a waiting room
When did we start to rust? 
Don’t let it turn to dust
After all these years
You won’t talk or look at me
Is this what it’s come to?
We’re like strangers in a waiting room
After all the tears
You won’t talk or look at me
Is this what it’s come to?
We’re like strangers in a waiting room
When did we start to rust? 
Don’t let it turn to dust
When did we start to rust? 
Don’t let it turn to dust
 
I woke this morning in a city built on dreams
But all I could taste all I could smell was gasoline
I don’t know my fate
I choke and black smoke starts to fill my lungs oh
This world this world
That lives inside of me
Inside of me
Working night and day to live under a roof I’ll never call my own
While the man next-door fills a suitcase with the face of the queen
I won’t shed a tear
Because when I sleep my conscious is clear

Walking past the bars as they all close
When the rain hits my face
No matter what I do I can’t put out the flames
This world this world
That lives inside of me
Inside of me
I can’t tell if its heaven or hell
Yeah I can’t tell what is real
In this dirty world dirty world

I can’t tell if its heaven or hell
That lives inside of me
That lives inside
This world this world
That lives inside of me
Inside of me
I can’t tell if its heaven or hell
I can’t tell what is real
In this dirty world dirty world
In this dirty world dirty world
That lives inside of me
 
Out of answers only doubts
I question why, as we drive by
Another round to please the crowd
Let em fight, wrong our rights

We don’t have to run, I know we don’t belong here
I know we won’t belong, we live to get it all wrong, all wrong
We don’t have to hide, what’s the fun in choosing sides
Just to feel alone, we’re underneath the same sun, same sun

Driving cross the city lines
At least we don’t call it our own
Speeding off to touch the skyline
At least we know that we’re not home

We don’t have to run, I know we don’t belong here
I know we won’t belong, we live to get it all wrong, all wrong
We don’t have to hide, what’s the fun in choosing sides
Just to feel alone, we’re underneath the same sun, same sun

We’ll watch the sun as it’s sinking in
We’ll watch the sun as it’s sinking into, into the rearview

We don’t have to run, I know we don’t belong here
I know we won’t belong, we live to get it all wrong, all wrong
We don’t have to hide (We’ll watch the sun as it’s sinking in)
What’s the fun in choosing sides (We’ll watch the sun as it’s sinking in)
Just to feel alone  (We’ll watch the sun as it’s sinking in)
We’re underneath the same sun, same sun
