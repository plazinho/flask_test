Motherfucker!
Ugh!
 
Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Come wit' it now
Bulls on parade

Bulls on parade
 
Come on
Ugh
Come on

Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah
Yeah, back in this

With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard
I think I heard a shot

"Black Nationalism... 
 may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism"
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them"

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

How long? Not long
'Cause what you reap is what you sow
 
Huh
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another bombtrack
Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah

Know your enemy
Come on

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh

Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The "land of the free"?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay

Know your enemy


Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
 
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio

Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off, Mumia, go on, be free
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
Army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out the box, it's my radio dial

Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out, guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here?
What better time than now?

All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
 
Yeah
The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that makes you ill

The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire
Yeah


Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
 
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds!

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"
Run it


Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?" Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "how high?"

Checka, checka, check it out
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds!
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again, jack, and then rewind the tape
And then play it again, and again, and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say "how high?"
Ya braindead, ya got a fuckin' bullet in ya head

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high, yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Ugh
Yeah
Yeah
Fuck
Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya got a bullet in ya head
Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya got a bullet in ya head

A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in the head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
Ya got a bullet in ya fuckin' head
Yeah
Yeah
 
Crank the music up
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit


And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
Uh!

Yeah, take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on, take it back, y'all
Take it back, a-take it back, a-take it back, y'all
Come on, uh, yeah
 
Uh

The movie ran through me
The glamour subdue me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty. please fill me
Mister Anchor, assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice, it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing
I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you
Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Now testify
It's right outside your door, now testify
Yes, testify
It's right outside your door

With precision you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me, so I can carry on
My slaving, sweating the skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking on the smoke that fills my home
The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

While on the corner (Corner)
The jury's sleepless (Sleepless)
We found your weakness (Weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Yeah, testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Now testify
And it's right outside your door

Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set
Mass graves for the pump when the price is set
When the price is set


Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now?

Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door
 
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

Bangin' this bolo tight, on this solo flight, can't fight alone
Funk the track, my verbs sly like the Family Stone
Them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
Locked without a wage, you're standing in the drop zone
The clockers born, starin' at an empty plate
Mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set, ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
Schoolyard to precinct, suburb to project block
Bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war

Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yes, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

Yeah
Bear witness to the sickest shot while suckers get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin', still clockin' dirt for our sweat
A ballot's dead, so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin' 'em
Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin' 'em
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawns
To off the Kings on the west side at dawn

Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
Make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
Yeah, I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun

(The rungs torn from the ladder, can't reach the tumor)
(One god, one market, one truth, one consumer)
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Yeaah
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we'll never have
Just a quiet, peaceful dance
For the things we don't have
 
Uhh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayy, yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn


Hey, yo, it's just another bombtrack
Check it out

Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn
 
Uh
Pump, pump, woo!
Come on
Uh

Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion drawn up by the thoughts I think

Yeah
Come on
The militant poet in once again, check it

It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sendin' us to early graves for all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry, I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?

(Anger is a gift)
Come on
Uh


Drop that
Uh
Come on
Yeah
Uh

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall playin' Tic-Tac-Toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding
On the level of our unconsciousness
For example, what does the billboard say?
"Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement"

(Anger is a gift)

Yeah
Uh
Aw, bring that shit in
Uh
Hey

Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah, right
 
Yeah, people come up
Yeah, we better turn the bass up on this one

Check it, since fifteen hundred and sixteen, Mayans attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
With their borders and boots on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis
But how you gonna get what you need to get?
The gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
The fifth sun sets get back reclaim
The spirit of Cuauhtémoc, alive and untamed
Now face the funk now blastin' out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you got a gun
Yeah, this is for the people of the sun

It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again

Yeah, never forget that the whip snapped ya back
Your spine cracked for tobacc-oh, I'm the Marlboro Man, uh
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist
Sailors' blood on the deck, come sister, resist
From the era of terror, check this photo lens
Now the City of Angels does the ethnic cleanse, uh
Heads bobbin' to the funk out your speaker
On the one, Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal your name but now you found a gun
You're history
This is for the people of the sun

It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again, yeah
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around again
It's comin' back around again
This is for the people of the sun
It's comin' back around
Of the sun
 
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Feel the funk blast
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out, yo, yo, yo

I be walkin' God like a dog, my narrative, fearless
My word war returns to burn like Baldwin home from Paris
Like Steel from a furnace, I was born landless
This is the native son, born of Zapata's guns
Stroll through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry but with different last names
These vultures rob everything, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point on the globe, yes, the picture's the same
There's a bank, there's a church, a myth and a hearse
A mall and a loan, a child dead at birth
There's a widow pig parrot, a rebel to tame
A white-hooded judge, a syringe and a vein
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)
I'm calm like a bomb
(Ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite, ignite)

This ain't subliminal, feel the critical mass approach horizon
The pulse of the condemned, sound off America's demise
The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, yes, I spit fire
Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires
Yes, back through the shanties and the cities' remains
Same bodies buried hungry (Uh-huh), but with different last names (Uh-huh)
Them vultures robbin' everyone, leave nothing but chains
Pick a point here at home, yes, the picture's the same
There's a field full of slaves, some corn and some debt
There's a ditch full of bodies, the check for the rent
There's a tap, the phone, the silence of stone
The numb black screen that be feelin' like home
And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard

What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?
What you say, what you say, what you say, what?

There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
There's a right to obey and there's a right to kill
There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
'Cause there's a right to obey and there's the right to kill
 
Turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Turn it off, turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

Merge on the networks, slangin' nerve gas
Up jump the boogie, then bang, let 'em hang
While the paranoid try to stuff the void
Let's capture this AM mayhem
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The power pendulum swings by the umbilical cord
Shock around the clock, from noon 'til noon
Men grabbin' they mics and stuff 'em into the womb
Terror's the product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict, aw shit, I got a headrush
Sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
Undressed and blessed by the Lord
The same devil that ran around Managua wit' a sword
Check out the new style that Ollie found
A tune with a bullet to shut down the devil sound

Shut down the devil sound
The program of Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound

Turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Turn it off, turn on the radio
Nah, fuck it, turn it off
Fear is your only god on the radio
Nah, fuck it
Your savior, my guillotine, crosses and kerosene

Flex the cerebellum, fire, uh
Somebody gotta shell 'em, these evil angels' lists
Hittin' the AM playlist, paid to say this
That one's inhuman, illegal, single, woman
The one without a movement
The transmissions whippin' our backs
Yeah, comin' down like bats from Stacey Koon and
Terror's the product ya push
Well, I'm a truth addict, aw shit, I got a headrush
The sheep tremble and here come the votes
Thrown from the throat, cages and scapegoats
One caution, the mic's a detonator, unwound (Unwound)
To shut down the devil sound

Shut down the devil sound
Check the heads bow in Vietnow
Shut down the devil sound

Is all the world jails and churches?
Is all the world jails and churches?

Huh!
Check it
Uh!

Silence, something about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent sorta like a slit wrist
If the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if ya bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
Some speak the sounds but speak in silent voices
Like radio is silent though it fills the air with noises
Its transmissions bring submission as ya mold to the unreal
And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
Yeah

And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
With a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)

It's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
If ya will it, I will spill it and ya out
Just as quick as ya came
Not a silent one, but a defiant one
Never a normal one 'cause I'm the bastard son
With the visions of the move, vocals not to soothe
But to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance
Groovin', playin' that game called survival
The status, the elite, the enemy, the rival
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
Give you a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'
Steppin' into the jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille
Mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
Yeah

And mad boy grips the microphone with a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
('Cause I know the power of the question)
With a fistful of steel
With a fistful of steel
(And I won't stop 'cause I know the power of the question)
Aw shit

(And I won't stop, 'cause I know the power of the question!)

And if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'
Yeah
Come on

A .44 full of bullets
Face full of pale
Eyes full of empty
A stare full of nails
The roulette ball
Rolls alone on the wheel
A mind full of fire
And a fistful of steel
And if the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button
But if you're bowin' down, then let me do the cuttin'

Yeah
With a fistful of steel, uh
Come on
Uh, with a fistful of steel
Uh
 
The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling
From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere
There be no shelter here
Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memories erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

Hospitals not profit full
The market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View the world from American eyes
The poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he's got a dope pair of Nikes on
Godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer
Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

American eyes, American eyes
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothing behind
American eyes, American eyes
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothing behind

Just stare
Just stare
Just stare
Just stare
Relive the nightmare
 
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side
Suicide

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face
Yeah


If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
 
Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell, yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom, or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peaceful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion
Yeah, what about that, sucka?

Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
Yes, I'll display the fitness, and flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist!
Asleep though we stand in the midst of the war
Gotta get mine, gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me?
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck 'til our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm


Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm

What's it gonna take?

Shackle their minds when they're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackle their minds when they're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Shackled our minds when we're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost
Lost
Shackle your minds and you're left on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Just shackle your minds when you're bent on the cross
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Lost

Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform?
Fight the war, fuck the norm
 
My fears hunt me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man

Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within
Their wings banging and burning
On through endless night
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man

My fear is hunting me down
Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my

Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
Born of a broken man, but not a broken man
Born of a broken man, never a broken man
