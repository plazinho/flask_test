I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
Yeah, well

Didn't know what I was missin', now I see a lil' different
I was, thinkin' too much, got stuck in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chillin'
Plus I know it's a, it's a beautiful feelin'
In oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah

Yeah, okay, I ride around my city when I come home, yeah
The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah
I disconnect and upload
Watch it spin around, we just spinnin' round, yeah
Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah
We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love, so
Tell me, are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safe in there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?

Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chillin'
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feelin'
In oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
 
I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door

Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, (Uh, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, now

I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets, roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now (Alright)
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm burning away
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

I been having trouble sleeping, battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing: is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't God as I, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wondering, well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is

But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of
My life, alright
When I get faded you hate it, but, baby
It’s gon' be alright
Haha, alright
 
Yeah
Eric
Well

I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
 
Can you turn the beat up?
A little louder
There you go

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
 
Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no ($ign)

It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore, I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we movin' to the floor
You started gettin' crazy, told me fuck you like a whore

You used to tell me all the time I ain't ya type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doin' everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn, it feels so right (Yeah)
But I still respect ya game
Every time I'm out-of-line, you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sakes, I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

Hey now, I'm sayin'
My only way out is a way in

'Til you mine, no way
Well, all my days now, they changin'
I got an angels, no more Satan
Looks like God's on my side
This time, yeah

Been meanin' to tell ya
You lookin' better every day
Write you letters, it's only right that
Right after love, I write my name, yeah
If it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather, feel much better
When that weather isn't rain, yeah

Ooh, Cinderella
Don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been takin'
All day, yeah
Well, wherever you came from, wherever you goin'
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah
So don't you dare throw this away

I been meanin' to tell ya
You look better every day
Write you letters, it's only right that
Right after love, I write my name, yeah
And if it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather, feel much better
When that weather isn't rain
 
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself

And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rap diablo
Yeah, yeah

It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human
I'm amphibian, fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society, I tell my bitch
If she don't love me then just lie to me, I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me

'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies

Yeah, um
Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
 
I don't know why, but I think that he makes me smile

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part (Oh)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love, yeah, yeah

If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow, baby
'Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine, oh, yeah

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

And I'm left with my hand on my face, all red
In the face, lookin' at you like "wait!"
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late, well...
(I can't keep on losin' you) Don't run away so fast
Know my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old and I act so young
Baby, you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'ma give you some
Make you feel like (Woo) when I hit that drum
Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited

Losin' you over complications

Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude

Startin' up the engine, need to reboot

I know you don't want nuttin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keepin' me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seem invitin', trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Where you takin' this trip to? Wait!
Don't move, don't stay, too
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Wait!
Where the hell you goin'?

I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

Woo
 
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see: Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, "Ow," make 'em say, "Oh"
The hoes that tell me "Yes," the same ones that tell ya "No"
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever
 
Hey
Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man's kinda high out here *Laughs*

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, "fuck it"
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? (Hey)

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
 
Yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Well, okay

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
Everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

A—a'ight, a'ight
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine (Yeah,) keep to myself, takin' my time (Uh-huh)
Always into some bullshit, and outta line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a (or a), or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
Well, o-kay (Yeah)

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)

Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Bless, bless)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
(Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

Hurt
Feelings
 
Uh, close your eyes

So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin' you just tryna live your life and have some fun in
A world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is...

Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Uh
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night, wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie, can't you see I'm chillin'? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high
Go for what you know (Yeah)
Let it in your mental (Macadelic)
And don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
(No) Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Uh, I told you it won't stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you

You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Fuck me
I want you to fuck me (I want you to fuck me)
I want you to fuck me (Oh yeah)
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Don't stop
Stop
 
Well, this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessing your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm
Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
Damn, and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
Drawin' circles
 
Yeah
Haha

Uh, think I can see a fuckin' halo (Halo), about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano (Drano), some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs (Sheesh)
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe (Please)
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored (Tailored), me and Action rappin'
Al be fuckin' with the fader (Fader), sippin' mind eraser
Actually, we rappin' for the fuck of it
Takin' money from you, gonna smack you out in public
You the Republican government
Abundance of substance, have a consumption to fuck a bitch (*Woman moans*)
With your Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch lookin' like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
(I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty-fifth
(I said it must be the drugs)
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
(I said it must be the drugs)
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
(I said it must be the drugs)
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
(I said it must be the drugs)
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
(I said it must be the drugs)
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? (My head)
(I said it must be the drugs)

Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first (Never)
After rappin', take my people out for octopus (Spanish)
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam (Uh, uh)
Don't hold your hand out for nothin' if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peelin' off a whip like when your mother strip (Strip)
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip (King Crack)
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hands are fuckin' hotter than the leather in the six in the summertime (Uh)
Understand I'm only rhymin' for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede Puma
My look is Jay Buhner, doggy, ‘cause some of us just age sooner (I'm goin', man)
I'm still twisted, rockin' lizards from a strange river (River)
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio (Bio)
I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
(I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
(I said it must be the drugs)
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
(I said it must be the drugs)
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
(I said it must be the drugs)
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
(I said it must be the drugs)
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
(I said it must be the drugs)
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? (My head)
(I said it must be the drugs)

Uh, uh
Bitch, I'm noddin' off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly givin' y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor chasin' after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops (Stoops) to smokin' on roofs (Roofs)
I came from that basement, now look at this view (View)
Makin' this money (Money), blowin' it all (All)
Fuck what you did (Did), just show me results (Results)

Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses, I led 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfuckin' fakin' that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat!

I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs


You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you "beastie," boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nike's on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
 
Whoop
Whoop
Ladies and gentlemen
This is Macadelic
You motherfucker, hahahaha

Uh
I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love, I'm like, "Bitch, you must be trippin'"
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
And it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mill' more, then a number one spot on the Billboard

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

Argh
I'ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team in that pack with me, hear the Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah, I got raps, tryna talk shit, what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank roll, I'ma lay low, chill, 'til I let that stack

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
 
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now, when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got


Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got
 
I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh, baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's gettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down

And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down

Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down
 
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smokin' ********* until I'm coughin' up tar
Feel the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style (Perfect style)
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm (Above the norm)
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal (Fuckin' deal)
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't talk about some money, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow (Would let it slow)
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though (Extra though)
Yeah

And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinkin' this decor suits me (This decor suits me)
I do drugs, get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful (It's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Could finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech, they try assassinatin' all of my beliefs
(But I'm asleep) So whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine (Shrine)
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Yeah, can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)
I'm lookin' out my window, ashin' on the pane (Ashin' on the pane)
Shit, wonder if I lost my way (Lost my way)

Yeah, don't you ever wanna hide away? (Hide away)
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today (Die today)
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face (Smilin' face)
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' (Keep changin')
Dreamin' of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in Heaven I plan to leave wasted (Leave wasted)
Retracin' my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down
And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god
