For your love
For your love
For your love
I give you everything and more, and that's for sure
For your love
I bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
For your love

To thrill you with delight, I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love

For your love, for your love
I would give the stars above
For your love, for your love
I would give you all I could

For your love
For your love
For your love
I'd give the moon if it were mine to give
For your love
I'd give the stars and the sun for I live
For your love

To thrill you with delight, I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
 
Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
"Where is she, tell me where?"

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul


And I know
If she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul
 
{intro}
See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing, they kiss your tears when you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
See the rain hide away in disgrace
Still I'm sad
{Bridge}
For myself my tears just fall into dust
Day will dry them, night will find they are lost
Now I find the wind is blowing time into my heart
Let the rain fall, for we are apart
How I'm sad
How I'm sad
Oh, how I'm sad
 
Can you judge a man
By the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind
By the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man
By the pattern on his tie?

Then Mister you're a better man than I
Yeah Mister You're a better man than I
Oh Mister You're a better man than I
Yeah Mister You're a better man than I

Could you tell a wise man
By the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important
Than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool
If for wealth he doesn't strive


Could you condemn a man
If your faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin
Is the colour of his soul?
Or could you say if men
For king and country all must die?
 
Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen?
When time and tide have been

Fall into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?


Soon I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind
 
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Cars and girls are easy come by in this day and age
Laughing, joking, drinking, smoking
'Till I've spent my wage
When I was young people spoke of im-mor-ality
All the things they said were wrong
Are what I want to be

(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
When will it end
(When will it end)
When will it end
(When will it end)
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I find comment 'bout my looks irrelativity
Think I'll go and have some fun
Cause it's all for free
I'm not searching for a reason to enjoy myself
Seems it's better done
Than argued with somebody else

(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
When will it end
(When will it end)
When will it end
(When will it end)
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
 
Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now I'm a man
Made twenty-one
And you got to know baby
We can have a lot of fun

I'm a man
I spell M A N, man
A full grown man, lover man
Alright, take it easy now
I hear you, I hear you

All you pretty women stand in line
I can make love to you baby
In an hour's time
Ain't that amazing?
I spell M A N, man
I'm a man, I'm a man
Full grown man, ain't that a man?
I'm a rollin' stone
Goin' back down to Mississippi to
Bring back the second cousin
Little John, the conqueroo

I'm a man
I spell M A N, man
A full grown lover man
I'm a rollin' stone

The line I shoot will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist

Man
I spell M A N, man
I'm a man
I'm a full grown man, yeah

A man
I'm a natural born lover man
You don't talk about
A man
 
Aboard a train
I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City
As we strut down on that ol' fairlane
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
Get along
Sweet little woman get along
On your way
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
I made a stop round Albuquerque
She must'a thought I was real gone jerk
Got off the train at El Paso
A' looking so good I couldn't let her go
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go
 
Can you judge a man
By the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind
By the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man
By the pattern on his tie?
Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I
Could you tell a wise man
By the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important
Than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool
If for wealth he doesn't strive?
Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I
Can you condemn a man
If you're faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin
Is the colour of his soul?
Could you say that men
For king and country all must die?
Well, Mr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I
 
I'm dazed and confused
Is it stay, is it go?
Give me a clue
'Cos I just want to know
Give me a clue as to where I am at
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat
I'm dazed and confused
Hangin' on by a thread
I've been abused
I'd be better off dead
Can't stand the heat
And I'm starting to crack
If you're out to get me
You're on the right track
I'm dazed and confused
Is it stay, is it go?
I still love you
But I still want to know
Secrets are fun to a certain degree
This one's no fun cause the secret's on me
I'm dazed and confused
Is it stay, is it go?
I've been abused
And I sure wanna know
Give me a clue as to where I am at
Feel like a mouse, and you act like a cat
 

 
Meeting people along my way
Seemingly I'm on one day
Familiarity of things
That my dreaming always brings

Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time

Walking in the room I see
Things that mean a lot to me
Why they do I never know
Memories don't strike me so
Memories don't strike me so

It seems to me I've been here before
The sounds I heard, and the sights I saw
Was it real, was it in my dreams
I need to know what it all means


Happenings ten years time ago
Situations we really know
But the knowing is in the mind
Sinking deep into the well of time
Sinking deep into the well of time
 
Strollin' on
'Cos it's all gone
The reason why
You made me cry
By tellin' me
You didn't see
The future bore
Our love no more
If you want to know
I love you so
And I don't want to let you go
I'm strollin' on
Gonna make you see
I'm strollin' on
You'll find you really love me
I'm strollin' on
Be your turn to cry
I'm strollin' on
You wish you'd never lied
You're going to change your mind
But you ain't gonna find
Any more of my kind
I'm strollin' on
'Cos it's all gone
The reason why
You made me cry
By tellin' me
You didn't see
The future bore
Our lovin' no more
If you want to know
I love you so
I don't want to let you go
I'm strollin' on
Gonna make you see
I'm strollin' on
You'll find you really love me
I'm strollin' on
Be your turn to cry
I'm strollin' on
You wish you'd never lied
You're going to change your mind
But you ain't gonna find
Any more of my kind
 
Don't know where to run to
Don't know where to hide
See my future coming
Like the rising of the tide
But I lost you
Lost you woman
The only woman
Woman who was my kind
Made me lose my money
You made me lose my mind
It's people like you, baby
Going to rule mankind
But I lost you
Lost you woman
The only woman
Woman who was my kind
But if you come back
I won't be the same
What you did to me
You can hardly call humane
But I lost you
But I still love you
The only woman
Woman who was my kind
 
Ah-ah-ah...
How your restless hungry eyes
Speak of cloudy summer skies
The morning dew
Turns into rain
Lonely winds will call my name
Dying leaves of seasons brown
Losing life as they drift down
Too soon in life
Return to earth
Only they can know their worth
Distant dreams of things to be
Wandering thoughts that can't be free
I feel my mind
Turning away
To the darkness of my day
 
Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby, I wish you would
Try and love me, you won't do no good

Walking and a-kissing late at night
I tell you now baby, I feel just right
Come now baby, whatcha trying to do?
Trying to love me and some other man too
Come now baby, give me one more chance
You know I still love you, want to give you romance
Yeah, give you romance, all night long
In my arms, woah, yeah

Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby, I wish you would
Try and love me, you won't do no good

You know baby, that I love you so
You know pretty baby, it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah, oh yeah
 
I'm searching for my baby
Well I think I'm gonna cry
I'm searching for my baby
I think I'm gonna cry, yeah
I can't find that woman
No matter how hard I try
Well I've got myself a car
And the thing is painted blue
Well I've got myself a car
And that thing is painted blue
But no matter what's done to me baby
I guess I'll always be blue
I got a hundred and fifty things
Now all I gotta find is you
I got a hundred and fifty things
Now all I gotta find is you
And if the Nazz don't help me baby
You better forget about me too
 
I'm not talking
Well that's all I got to say
Used to think I knew it
Man I sure outgrew it
Things like idle chatter
Ain't the things that matter
That's one thing I can do without

I'm not talking
Well that's all I got to say
Things I say at midnight
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight
I reached the final conclusion
And all this persecution
Don't call me, baby, I'll call you

I'm not talking
Well that's all I got to say
Things I say at midnight
I ain't gonna say 'em in daylight
I reached the final conclusion
And all this persecution
That's one thing I can do without

I'm not talking
Well that's all I got to say
If I said things were awful
It might just be unlawful
If I said things were splendid
I might just be offended
That's one thing I can do without
 
Little games are for little boys
Growing up and changing all my toys
Aeroplanes, motor cars, goldfish in old jam-jars
I just don't play these games no more
Little games are for little boys
Loving games are for bigger boys
Parties in Chelsea flats, mixing with kinky cats
Are games I wanna play some more

Ooh, what they're doing to me
Darling it's so plain to see
My temperature's rising but that's not surprising
When you do what you do to me

Little games are for little boys
I found out there are other joys
Margaret, Josephine, Susie and Catherine
They help me in my little games



My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Play my little games
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Say I need you, I need you
 
(Yardbirds)
Pennsylvania snow is pretty thick
Michigan ain't where I get my kicks
Texas is fine but it gets too hot
And New York City's not a place to stop
New Orleans is the home of the blues
But California's my home with Mary Hughes
Down in Mississippi I'm told is nice
And all the meals there, they come with rice
Oregon and Iowa are not for me
The Colorado mountains are something you must see
But back in California there's nothing to lose
'Cos everything's swinging there with Mary Hughes
