Your cruel device, your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot, your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet, black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

One look (one look) could kill (could kill)
My pain, your thrill

I want to love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)

Burning deep (poison) inside my brain

Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well, we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya, that's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Yeah!

Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think
Of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm feelin' real shot down
And I'm, I'm gettin' mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes (Nice guy)
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith
He, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen, and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I gotta get out of this place, I'll go runnin in outer space, oh yeah

I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm eighteen
I get confused everyday
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away

Lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes I like it, oh I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, Eighteen!
Eighteen, eighteen and I like it10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore ya
Man or woman living
Couldn’t love you like me baby

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Aww!
Yeah, billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter
Any tighter than me maybe
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog
That's been infected by the rabies
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Million dollar baby
Yeah, billion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby

Mommy, where's daddy?
He's been gone for so long
Do you think he'll ever come home?

I was gone for fourteen days
I might been gone for more
Held up in the intensive care ward
Lyin' on the floor
I was gone for all those days
But I, was not all alone
I made friends with a lot of people
In the danger zone

See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Since I've gone away

I think I lost some weight there
And I, I'm sure I need some rest
Sleepin' don't come very easy
In a straight white vest
Sure'd like to see that little children
She's only four years old... old
I'd give her back all of her playthings
Even, even the ones I stole
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone insane

I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here
I, I gotta get out of here
I, I gotta get out of here
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere
Ya gotta let me out of here
Let me outta here
(Incoherent rambling shouts continue and fade as next verse starts)

See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Blown up in my face


I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I, I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to myself this is very strange
I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin'
And so I am not free
I didn't want to be
I didn't want to be
I didn't want to be
See my lonely life unfold
(I didn't want to be)
I see it every day
(Leave me alone
I didn't want to be
Don't touch me!)
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone Insane1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for's
An even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
Slaps you once in a while
And you live in love and pain
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Black eyes all of the time
"Don't spend a dime"
"Clean up this grime"
And you there down on your knees
Begging me please
Come watch me bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't want to see you go
I don't even want to be there
I will cover up my eyes
And pray it goes away
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
I don't like to hear you cry
You just don't know how deep that cuts me
So I will cover up my eyes
And it will go away
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
STEVEN!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
That icy breath that whispers screams of pain!
I don't want to feel you die
But if that's the way that God has planned you
I'll put pennies on your eyes
And it will go away
See?
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
Steven.... Is someone calling me? No....
Steven....
I think I hear a voice--- it's outside the door!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!

Is someone calling me? I hear my name!

Yes, yes, I know you're hungry
And here comes dinner
(Feed my Frankenstein)

Well, I ain't evil
I'm just good lookin'
Start a little fire
Baby, start cookin'
I'm a hungry man
But I don't want pizza
I'll blow down your house
And then I'm gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers
Up your greasy spine

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time
You don't want to talk
So baby, shut up
And let me drink the wine
From your fur tea cup
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Make my tattoos
Melt in the heat
Well, I ain't no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin' on your
Ice cream cone

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time

Baby whoa whoa, oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstein
Whoa whoa, baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstein
He's a psycho
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's lunch time

For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly
For making us doubt our parent's authority
For choosing to be a living obscenity
You can go to Hell
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane
You'd gift wrap a leper
And mail him to your Aunt Jane
You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane
You can go to Hell
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to HellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Welcome to my nightmare
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel you belong
A nocturnal vacation
Unnecessary sedation
You want to feel at home cause you belong
Welcome to my nightmare, whoa-whoa-oh

I hope I didn't scare you
That's just the way we are when we come down
We sweat and laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here

The bluing flesh for me to hold
Cadaver eyes upon me see

No farewells, no goodbyes

I have other uses for you, darling

Hey bro, take it slow
You ain't livin' in a video
You're flying low with a high velocity
No doubt, you're stressin' out
That ain't what rock n' roll's about
Get off that one way trip down lonely street
Now I know you've been kicked around
You ain't alone in this ugly town
You stick a needle in your arm
You bite the dust, you buy the farm

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

C'mon girl, it's a better day
Get your foot out of that grave
Don't let that one love tear your world apart
C'mon babe, kick that stuff
Show the street it ain't so tough
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart
Now I know you've been seeing red
Don't put a pistol to your head
Sometimes your answer's heaven sent
Your way is so damn permanent

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid

This ain't your daddy talkin'
You know, I know
Your story ain't so shocking
You know, I know
Blow some steam
C'mon and scream

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid
What ya tryin' to do

They win you lose

She got them from the shelf up on the wall
Betty's mommy wasn't there to save her

Well, we didn't want you anyway

You're with your baby
And you're parked alone
On a summer night
You're deep in love
But you're deeper in the woods
You think you're doin' alright
Did you hear that voice?
Did you see that face?
Or was it just a dream?
This can't be real
That only happens, babe
On the movie screen
Oh, but he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole
You're swimmin' with your girl
Out on lovers' lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones
But you're still on the make
That's a bad mistake
Ahh, But the moon was full
And you had a chance
To be all alone
But you're not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance
Yeah, cause he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

Oh, if you see him comin'
Get away if you can
Just keep on runnin'
Run as fast as you can
He's a dangerous, dangerous man
And he's out tonight
And he's watchin' you
And he knows your house
No, don't turn out the lights
Yeah, cause he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul

Get ready for the lady
She's gonna be a treat
Simmer slightly 'til ready

I squeeze the love out of your soul
All the perfect love that's in your soul

"Leaving Lepidoptera – please don't touch the displays, little boy; so cute – moving to the next aisle we have arachnida: the spiders, our finest collection. This friendly little devil is the Heptophilidae, unfortunately harmless. Next to him, the nasty Lycosa Raptoria; his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of the skin. And here, my prize, the Black Widow. Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. Her kiss is fifteen times as poisonous as that of the Rattlesnake. You see, her venom is highly neuro-toxic, which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system - causing intense pain, profuse sweating, difficulty in breathing, loss of consciousness, violent convulsions and finally death. You know, I think what I love the most about her is her inborn need to dominate, possess. In fact, immediately after the consummation of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the specie, she kills and eats him. Oh, she is delicious, and I hope he was. Such power and dignity unhampered by sentiment. If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy; I feel that Man has ruled this world as stumbling, demented child-king long enough, and as his empire crumbles my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor."EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've got the answers to all of your questions
If you've got the money to pay me in gold
I will be living in old Monte Carlo
And you will be reading the secrets I sold

Daggers and contacts and bright shiny limos
I've got a watch that turns into a lifeboat
Glimmering nightgowns, poisonous as cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe

The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks
And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash, halo of flies

I crossed the ocean, where no one would see
And I put a time-bomb in your submarine, now
Goodbye to old friends, the secret's in hand
With phonied up papers, and counterfeit plans
You never will understand

I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light
And my shadow has life of its own
Watching you while you sleep all alone
When the night is all cool skin and bones
And you lie wrapped in sheets on your own
There's a ring on your dead telephone
Don't be scared when there's nobody home
Like a spider web kiss on your face
That familiar smell, just a trace
That's my scent that I left on your lace
So you're never alone
No you're never alone
I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of lightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
