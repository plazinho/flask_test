Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You'll know
You will know

Fuck

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)

I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too


Well, I've been afraid of changing

Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day

So I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you

I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
(She was just a wish)
(She was just a wish)
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice

For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before
Like never before
Like never before9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I could turn the page
In time, then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home

Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman

She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

You don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Out your name?
You know that I'm falling

And I can't get the words out

Oh I

Something's happening
Happening to me

Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire

Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home
Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here

Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?

Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?

So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

The rainbow's edge

So it's hard to find

Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
{Instrumental Bridge}

Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
