Acting all above it when our friends divorced

You thought I wouldn't see it if you put it in my face
Give you all my money, you'll gladly walk away
You think it's justifiable, I think it's pretty cruel
And you know you lie best when you lie to you
'Cause, boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat
And, boy, that's exactly why you ain't comin' home
Save your tired stories for your new someone else

Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said "would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low"
She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go"

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said, "When it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while"

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead?"
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Print yourself a weapon and take it to the gun range

Standin' with Emma and our sons and daughters
Watchin' our youth have to solve our problems

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

I know you've said
"Can't you just get over it?"
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself

Not that you asked
But I'm getting past everything, everything
I'm doing okay
Just glad it's not yesterday, huh

My husband's girlfriend's husband just called me up
How messed up is that?
It's so insane that I have to laugh
But then I think about our two boys trying to become men
There's nothing funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

You're only as sick as your secrets
So I'm telling everything
Half of the shit you won't believe
But I know it's not unique to me
Remember you brought her to our show at the Hollywood Bowl
She said, "I love you, I'm such a fan"
I joked that you can love me as long as you don't love my man
There's nothin' funny about that

How do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)
Lookin' me in the eye (Oh)
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night? (Oh)
How do you sleep at night?

So caught up in your story
You don't care what you're ruining
So caught up in your story
But you don't care

How do you sleep at night?
How do you tell those lies?
Lookin' me in the eye
Livin' a double life
Tell me, how do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?
Oh (Oh)
How do you tell those lies? (Oh)

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said "Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know"

Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey

Well hey, hey, hey
Aw, hey, hey, hey
Well hey, hey, hey2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

Well, I've been afraid of changing

I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?

I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?
I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind?

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away

I am so tired, I
Have to tame my mind
Before I get too frustrated
Can't go back in time
To change in someone's eyes
No, I was not something to play with

Try not to talk about it
I'm too mad, I'm too late, I'm too gentle

While everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to
Forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you

Sometimes, I close my eyes
Amidst the dancing lights
When it feels too wild for breathing
I can't sleep at night
Unless I start to lie
And believe it like a story, no, no
Try not to think about it
So insane, I'm so used to my nightmares
It's okay 'til it's not and I'm back there
No, no

Take what I need and go

Strangest thing not having you here with me

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away

I had no words for you that Saturday
As we both watched our entire worlds change
Your hero fell just as you came of age
And I had no words, but now I know what to say

You're of me, not mine
Walk your own crooked line
I promise you'll be fine
Take the best parts of him
As your own life begins
Leave the bad news behind you

Young man
Take a good look at my life and
Try to understand
I've done my best the best I know how to
And my blues aren't your blues
It's up to you

After this storm
There's nothing you can't navigate
Point to the truth
You'll see it's the only way
You're of me, not mine
Perfect in my eyes
You're gonna be alright
Take the best parts of him
As your own life begins
Leave the bad news behind

Would be for you to sign and release me
If you ever loved me
Then will you do this one last thing?
Set me free, set me free
Oh, set me free

To have and to hold
Oh, the weight of this hate was exhausting
You risked my body, broke my spirit
And still, I've let you go
Just because you've been a bad guy
I've seen it with my own eyes
There's a good guy in there

Decency
Would be for you to sign and release me
If you ever loved me
Then will you do this one last thing?
Set me free, set me free
Oh, set me free
Set me free, let me be
Oh, set me freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There I go trying to keep myself distracted
So I make the bed, call a friend, do the dishes
Should I have known? Should I have seen a sign?
When did you know? Why'd you pretend to try?

If you’re gone
I hope it's really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
Gave up on the moon and back
Thought you’d found a better half
Ah, I hope it's something good

Highs and lows, we fought our wars with silence
I'd have called you out, but baby, I knew you'd deny it
After so long, I learned to hold my tongue
And now that you're done, I get to write this song

And if you're gone
I hope it's really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
Gave up on the moon and back
Thought you’d found a better half
Ah, I hope it’s something good
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

If you're gone
I hope it’s really worth it
Twenty years of hanging on
Now it all adds up to nothin'
When you gave up on the moon and back
Thought you'd found your better half
I hope she's something goodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Who doesn't know what I'm talkin' about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes
Aahhh aahhh aahhh
Aahhh aahhh aahhh

As her folks drive away her dad yells, "Check the oil"
Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leavin' my girl"
She said, "It didn't seem like that long ago"
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needed, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes
She knows the highest stakes

(Wide open spaces)
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone
Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star

Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think
The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don’t know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well it’s been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone
Yeah yeah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
