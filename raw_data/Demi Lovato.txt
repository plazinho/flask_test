I got no excuses for all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over 'cause I'm dying inside
Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over and myself has reappeared

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

I'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again
I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
I’m not sober anymore

I'm sorry that I'm here again, I promise I'll get help
It wasn't my intention, I'm sorry to myself84EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Stone cold, stone cold
You see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor
Stone cold, stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore

Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

Hmmm, stone cold, stone cold
You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone
Stone cold, stone cold
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold

Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you
Don't wanna be stone cold, stone
I wish I could mend this, but here's my goodbye
Oh, I'm happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
If happy is her
If happy is her
I'm happy for you33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said

Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this

Uh, uh

I tried to talk to my piano
I tried to talk to my guitar
Talked to my imagination
Confided into alcohol
I tried and tried and tried some more
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore
Tired of empty conversation
'Cause no one hears me anymore

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
So, why am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone, oh
Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone
I used to crave the world's attention
I think I cried too many times
I just need some more affection
Anything to get me by

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
Why the fuck am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

Anyone, please send me anyone

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
It’s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
But I’m too relieved to grieve

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snow

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na, na na) Yeah

Mmm, ooh, yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho

He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit, though I admit that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though, you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely 'cause you didn't want me
Trying to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
The month was June
The smoky sun, our fated one
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely, 'cause you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fucking lonely, yeah

Lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh-woah

It's just a little red wine, I'll be fine
Not like I wanna do this every night
I've been good, don't I deserve it?
I think I earned it, feels like it's worth it
In my mind, mind

Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay, but I was lying

I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, yeah

It's just a little white line, I'll be fine
But soon, that little white line is a little glass pipe
Tinfoil remedy, almost got the best of me
I keep praying I don't reach the end of my lifetime, mm
Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay, but I was lying

When you're dancing with the devil

Thought I knew my limit, yeah
I thought that I could quit it, yeah
I thought that I could walk away easily
But here I am, falling down on my knees
Praying for better days to come and wash this pain away
Could you please forgive me?
Lord, I'm sorry for dancing with the devil
Oh, yeah-yeah

Dancing with the devil, out of control (Yeah, yeah)
Almost made it to Heaven

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said "yes" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

The feelings are lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
You know there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I'll take off in a run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I'll burst into flames
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)

Standing on the front lines
Staring at the sun rise over the hill
Waiting for the kill
Sweet anticipation, never conversation
Tears in our eyes from holding too tight

Waiting till the demons come
Wait for us to see them run in our direction
Now they're staring at us through the trees
Got us falling to our knees to teach us a lesson

So tell me
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really want me?
Now that I see you clearer
I wonder, was I ever really happy?
Didn't get the chance to ask me
Now that I see you clearer
Was it just smoke and mirrors?
Was it just smoke and mirrors?

Holding onto tables, pulling out the staples
Keeping you close, now we're not afloat
Point me in the right direction, answer me one question
'Cause I could've sworn that I wasn't wrong
Waiting till the demons come
Wait for us to see them run in our direction
Staring at us through the trees
Got us falling to our knees to teach us a lesson (teach us a lesson)

So tell me
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really want me?
Now that I see you clearer
I wonder, was I ever really happy?
Didn't get the chance to ask me
Now that I see you clearer
Was it just smoke and mirrors?
Ooh, was it just smoke and mirrors?

Darling, I have been afraid
I could only call your name
Thank the heavens that you stayed
But if I'm telling you the truth
When I cut the tether loose
It was me, saving you

So tell me
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really want me?
Now that I see you clearer
I wonder, was I ever really happy?
Didn't get the chance to ask me
Now that I see you clearer
Was it just smoke and mirrors?

I see the future without you
The hell was I doing in the past?
Now that I've learned all about you
A love just like ours wouldn't last

I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say

That you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore

Money won't pay for your problems
You gotta fix them yourself
Vices and pity won't solve 'em
Stop feeling bad for yourself

I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say

That you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore
I'm sorry for honesty
I could not bear to lie to you, to lie with you
I'm sorry for honesty
I'm well aware I lie to you when I lie with you

You don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me, don't do it for me

You don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa, whoa
Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared, it's wrong)
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
(Let me give your heart a break)

'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (Your heart)
Your heart a break (A break)
Oh yeah, yeah

The day I first met you, you told me you'd never fall in love29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Were you ever taught when you were young
If you mess with things selfishly, they're bound to come undone?
I'm not the only one
That's been affected and resented every story you've spun
And I'm a lucky one
'Cause there are people worse off that have suffered enough
Haven't they suffered enough?
But you can't get enough of
Shuttin' down systеms for personal gain
Fightin' fires with flyers and prayin' for rain
Do you gеt off on pain?
We're not pawns in your game

Commander in Chief, honestly
If I did the things you do
I couldn't sleep, seriously
Do you even know the truth?
We're in a state of crisis, people are dyin'
While you line your pockets deep
Commander in Chief, how does it feel to still
Be able to breathe?

We were taught when we were young
If we fight for what's right, there won't be justice for just some
Won't give up, stand our ground
We'll be in the streets while you're bunkering down
Loud and proud, best believe
We'll still take a knee while you're

Are you ready?
Ha

It's time for me to take it
I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
'Cause this is my game, and you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back, now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Bitch, I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave

(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated-rated-rated

What's wrong with being confident?

It's time to get the chains out
Is your tongue tied up?
'Cause this is my ground and I'm dangerous
And you can get off
But it's all 'bout me tonight (tonight, ha)

(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
