The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where?
Who knows where?
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
So on we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another
It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share?
And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
He's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
 
Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just-a 5'9, beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Like a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy
Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Then suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun
Well the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Yeah, with just one look I was a bad mess
Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all
Had it all
 
If I could make a wish
I think I'd pass
Can't think of anythin' I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read

Making love with you
Has left me peaceful, warm, and tired
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel
Go to sleep

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe


Peace came upon me
And it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel
Go to sleep

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you
 
Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella
Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella
All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August she was mine
Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought
All the people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same
That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a queue
Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought
All the people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same
Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella
Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella
All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August she was mine

My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress

'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Woo!
I saw her head up to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at"
When suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table
When I heard somebody shooting a gun
Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"
Well I've gotta be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess

Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all

Hey, Carrie Anne
Hey, Carrie Anne
When we were at school, our games were simple
I played the janitor, you played a monitor
Then you played with older boys and prefects
What's the attraction in what they're doing?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
You were always something special to me
Quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were aging
Where is your magic disappearing?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
You're so, so like a woman to me (So like a woman to me)
So, so like a woman to me (So, so like a woman to me)
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
People live and learn but you're still learning
You use my mind and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over, you'll be with me
Then I'll hear the other people saying
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne
 
I should be better off without you
You take a pride in making me blue
I'm telling you my friend
It's got to be the end
We're through
I told you time and time again
You told me he was just a friend
But I found out some way
I've seen him every day
With you
'Cause you never treat me tenderly
You got no reason for leaving me
'Cause I can't leave you alone
'Cause I knew from the start
You'd be tearing me apart
Sooner or later
'Cause you never treat me tenderly
You got no reason for leaving me
'Cause I can't leave you alone
'Cause I knew from the start
You'd be tearing me apart
Sooner or later
And now my crying days are through
No longer shed a tear for you
I'm telling you my friend
It's got to be the end
We're through
We're through
We're through
 
{intro}
See the girl with cymbals on her fingers
Entering through the door
Ruby glistening from her navel
Shimmering around the floor
Bells on feet go, ting a ling a linging
Going through my head
Sweat is falling just-a-like-a tear drops
Running from her head
Now she's dancing, going through the movements
Swaying to and fro
Body moving, bringing back a memory
Thoughts of long ago
Blood is rushing, temperature is rising
Sweating from my brow
Like a snake, her body fascinates me
I can't look away now
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I'll have to leave
Now, shes moving all around the tables
Luring all in sight
But I know that she cannot see me
Hidden by the light
Closer, closer, she is getting nearer
Soon she'll be in reach
As I enter into a spotlight
She stands lost for speech
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I'll have to leave
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I'll have to leave
{Bridge}
Now I hold her, people are staring
Don't know what to think
And we struggle knocking over tables
Spilling all the drinks
Can't they understand that I want her?
Happens every week
Heavy hand upon my collar
Throws me in the street
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I'll have to leave, leave
 
Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?
Horses chasing cause they're racing
So they ain't so far
On a carousel, on a carousel
Nearer and nearer by changing horses, still so far away
People fighting for their places just get in my way
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
Still we're going round
On a carousel, on a carousel
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too
As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before
Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die
On a carousel, on a carousel
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too
Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?
Now we take our ride together
No more chasing her
On a carousel, on a carousel
 
I can't make it if you leave me
I'm sorry, Suzanne, believe me, I was wrong
And I knew I was all along
Forgive me
I still love you more than ever
I'm sorry, Suzanne, for ever hurting you
You know I never wanted to
I'm truly sorry, Suzanne
I could never ever justify
All the tears I made you cry
But I do regret it, my Suzanne
You gotta believe me
I was lookin' 'round for someone new
What a foolish thing to do
All the time I knew it
Heaven knows what made me do it, girl
I can't make it if you leave me
I'm sorry, Suzanne, believe me, I was wrong
And I knew I was all along, all along
I'm truly sorry, Suzanne
If you would only take me back again
Things would be so different then
What I wouldn't give for
One more chance to live for you, Suzanne
I can't make it if you leave me
I'm sorry, Suzanne, believe me, I was wrong
And I knew I was all along
Forgive me
I still love you more than ever
I'm sorry, Suzanne, for ever hurting you
You know I never wanted to
I'm truly sorry, Suzanne
 
Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my baby
Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight
Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all those silly New York virgins by the score
Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight, I promise I'll love you forever
Oh, I mean it, Sandy, girl
Oh, my baby
Hey, Sandy girl
My, my, my, my baby
Sandy, the waitress I was seeing has lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for telling fortunes better than they do?
For me, this boardwalk life's through
You ought to quit this scene, too, ooh
Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight, for I may never see you again
Hey, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my baby
Hey, Sandy, girl
Oh, my baby
Hey, Sandy girl
My, my, my, my, my, my baby
Hey, Sandy, girl
Oh, my baby
Hey, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my baby
 
Look through any window, yeah
What do you see?
Smilin' faces all around
Rushin' through the busy town
(Where do they go?) Movin' on their way
Walkin' down the highways and the byways
(Where do they go?) Movin' on their way
People with their shy ways and their sly ways
Oh, you can see the little children all around
Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you
Look through any window, yeah
Any time of day
See the drivers on the roads
Pullin' down their heavy loads
(Where do they go?) Movin' on their way
Drivin' down highways and the byways
(Where do they go?) Movin' on their way
Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways
Oh, you can see the little children all around
Oh, you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you
Look through any window, yeah
What do you see?
Smilin' faces all around
Rushin' through the busy town
(Where do they go?)
Movin' on their way
Movin' on their way
Movin' on their way
 
It's over, well over
In my mind and in my heart
It's over, well over
But then again, it didn't have a good start
You'd tell me, try to sell me
It could have been all I asked
It's over, well over
It's there and flows away a distant past
Now it's a long, dark road
Yes, a long, dark road
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you
Now it's a long, dark road
Yes, a long, dark road
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you
It's over, well over
And we can't revive what's past
It's gone now, moved on now
But then again it didn't have a chance to last
No, no, no, a chance to last
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road) (Baby, I need you, I need you)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Now it's a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
Yes, a long, dark road (It's a long, very long, road)
 
I couldn't leave you if I tried
There would be no place I could hide
Away away away from you
When we are walking hand-in-hand
Throwing a shell across the sand
It's grand, so grand, to hold your hand
Nobody there except the two of us
Diggin' what we see
Wouldn't it be so nice to drag your feet
In the edge of the sea?
So we are staying where we are
All of our problems seem so far
Away away away away
So we are staying where we are
All of our problems seem so far
Away away away away
Nobody there except the two of us
Diggin' what we see
Wouldn't it be so nice to drag your feet
In the edge of the sea?
So we are staying where we are
All of our problems seem so far
Away away away away
Nobody there except the two of us
Diggin' what we see
Wouldn't it be so nice to drag your feet
In the edge of the sea?
Away away away ...
 
If you could only see me
I know exactly where I am
You wouldn't want to be me
Oh, I can assure you of that
I'm not the guy to run with
'Cause I'll throw you off the line
I'll break you and destroy you
Given time
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
It's plain to see it's hopeless
Going on the way we are
So even though I'd lose you
You'd be better off by far
He's not the man to hold your trust
Everything he touches turns to dust
In his hands
Nothing he can do is right
He'd even like to sleep at night
But he can't
(All he touches turns to dust)
(All he touches turns to dust)
(All he touches turns to dust)
(All he touches turns to dust)
I wish someone would find me
And help me gain control
Before I lose my reason
And my soul
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
 
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
Just one look
And I felt so I, I, I'm in love
With you, oh, oh
I found out
How good it feels
To have your love, oh, oh
Say you will
Will be mine
Forever and always, oh, oh
Just one look
And I knew
That you were my only one, oh-oh-whoa
I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you, make you my own
So you see
I really care
Without you, I'm nothin', oh, oh
Just one look
And I know
I'll get you someday, oh-oh-whoa
I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you, make you my own
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
Just one look, that's all it took, yeah
 
Oh I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
Feel so bad, baby Oh, it hurts me
When I think of how you love and desert me
I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with, baby
You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go
Though I'm just one of your lovers
And I know there are so many others
You do something strange to me, baby, baby
You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go
Oh I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
Know that it's wrong and I should be so strong
But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on
You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go
You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
 
Who is the fox - I am the fox
Who are you - I am me
Who is me - Me is a thief
You'll bring your poor, poor mother grief
So after the fox, after the fox
Off to the hunt with chains and locks
So after the fox, after the fox
Someone is always chasing after the fox
Where is the gold - It's on the truck
Where's the truck - I won't tell
You must tell - Then I will lie
You'll make your poor, poor sister cry
So after the fox, after the fox
Off to the hunt with chains and locks
So after the fox, after the fox
Someone is always chasing after the fox
Why do you steal - So I'll be rich
Why not work - Work is hard
You'll be caught - I never fail
All little crooks wind up in jail - Not me not me
So after the fox, after the fox
Off to the hunt with chains and locks
So after the fox, after the fox
Someone is always chasing after the fox
After the fox
After the fox
After the fox
 
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind
Have you ever wondered why
Whenever thing goes wrong
Nobody stops to lend a hand
Nobody seems to care
When she looks you in the eye
And suddenly you're strong
And very soon you realize
That you didn't care about love
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care
And very soon you've forgotten that you didn't care about love
Does it hurt to realize
You've been acting very strange
Refusing to take the love she gives
Pretending you don't care
Did it take you by surprise
To discover how you'd changed
How you forgot to remember
That you didn't care about love
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care
And very soon you've forgotten
That you didn't care about love
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care
And very soon you've forgotten
That you didn't care about love
You didn't care about love
You didn't care about
You didn't care about
You didn't care about love
 
Shook my head out of dreams
Reality's calling
The early bird's been up all morning
But I've got no notion of moving from where I am
Though my legs won't move
I feel disabled
I'm on a shelf an article labeled
Waiting for someone to fetch me from lost and found
I'm down No one to hear me calling
I'm down No one to see me falling
I'm down
Had my ways
With days of sunshine
Life came easy it all fell in line
But then again I didn't realise
When you're used to one thing
It's hard to accept another
Like the woman who brought you up
Well she ain't your mother
How do you cope
With a thing like that
I'm down No one to hear me calling
I'm down No one to see me falling
I'm down
I always thought it was my dad who went to war
Thought it was my sister who fell off the wall
My pseudo-brother Billy emigrated long ago
Someone went through pain to have me
Someone I should know
I'm down
I'm down
To the folks who brought me up
I'm not ungrateful
Kept the secret from me
They thought it was shameful
It hurt me so
To be the last one to know
Maybe someone's out there
Looking for me
Left on their own
Couldn't afford to clothe me
And I I don't even know my real name
I'm down No one to hear me calling
I'm down No one to see me falling
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
