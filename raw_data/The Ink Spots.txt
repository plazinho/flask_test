I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don't wanna set the world on fire, honey
I love you too much
I just wanna start a great big flame down in your heart
You see, way down inside of me
Darling, I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know, nobody else ain't gonna do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just wanna be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's all over but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you
It's all over but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you

It's all over but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you
It's all over but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Maybe
You'll think of me, when you are all alone
Maybe, the one who is waiting for you
Will prove untrue
Then what will you do?

Maybe, you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near
Then, maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe
I'll say, "maybe."

If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, baby, would I feel this way?
Darlin', if this isnâ€™t love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart just stands still so much?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much, too much is fallin' in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine
Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Be sure it's true when you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true
When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Be sure it's true when you say I love you

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day
Keep smiling through, just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away
So will you please say hello to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day

Yeah, we'll meet again
I don't know where, and I don't know when
But I do know that we'll meet again some sunny day
So honey, keep on smilin' through
Just like you always do
'Till the blue skies drive all the dark clouds far away
And will you please say hello to all the folks that I know
And tell 'em that I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go

Address Unknown - not even a trace of you
Oh what I'd give to see the face of you
I was a fool to stay away from you so long
I should have known there'd come a day when you'd be gone

Address Unknown - oh how could I be so blind?
To think that you would never be hard to find?
From the place of your birth to the ends of the earth
I've searched only to find - only to find - Address Unknown

Address Unknown - honey child, I ain't even got a trace of ya
You know one thing?
I'd give anything in the world just to see the face of ya
I was a fool to stay away from you and everything else so long
I should have been diplomatic and figured that some day
You'd be solid gone

We three
We're all alone
Living in a memory
My echo, my shadow, and me
We three
We're not a crowd
We're not even company
My echo, my shadow, and me
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo
But where is the one I love?
We three
We'll wait for you
Even 'till eternity
My echo, my shadow, and me
We three
We're all alone
Seems like we're living in a memory
That's my echo, my shadow, and me
We three
We're no crowd
Fact is, we ain't even company
That's my echo, my shadow, and me
You know, I've been wondering
What good is the moonlight
That silvery moonlight
That shines way, way up above
Yeah, I walk with my shadow
I talk with my echo
But where is that gal that I love?
We three
We'll wait for you
Even 'till eternity

The moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life are free
The stars belong to everyone
They gleam there for you and me
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine
And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free
Honey, the moon belongs to everyone
You know the best things in life are free
And the stars, they belong to everyone
They're shining up there for you and for me
The flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine
And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free

In a quaint caravan
There's a lady they call the Gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears
Everything will come right
If you only believe the Gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears
She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday

You see, she looked at my hand and told me that my baby would always be true
And yet, in my heart I knew, dear
That somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me somedayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you
What good is a song if the words just don't belong
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone, to each his own
For me there's you
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow
To open each door there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you

If a flame is to grow, there must be a glow
And to open each door there's gotta be a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go

Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own

Why do you whisper, green grass
Why tell the tress what ain't so
Whispering grass, the trees don't have to know, no, no
Why tell them all your secrets
Who kissed there long ago
Whispering grass, the trees don't need to know
Don't you tell it to the trees
She will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told the blabbering trees
Yes, you told them once before
It's no secret anymore
Why tell them all the old things
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees
'Cause the trees don't need to know
Now, don't you tell it to the trees
'Cause they'll just run 'n' tell the birds and bees
Then everybody'd know 'Cause you told them doggone trees
Yes you did, you know you did, ya told 'em once before
Now look atcha', honey child, it ain't no secret no mo'
Why tell them all the old things
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees

Do I worry, 'cause you're stepping out?
Do I worry, 'cause you got me in doubt?
Though your kisses aren't right, do I give a bag of beans?
Do I stay home every night and read my magazines?
Am I frantic, 'cause we've lost the spark?
Is there panic, when it starts turning dark?
And when evening shadows creep, do I lose any sleep over you?
Do I worry? You can bet your life I do

Do I worry when the Iceman calls?
Do I worry if Niagara falls?
Though you treat me just like dirt
You think I give a snap?
Are my feelings really hurt
When you're sitting in somebody else's lap?
Am I curious when the gossip flies?
Am I furious 'bout your little white lies?
And when all our evenings end
'Cause you got a sick friend that needs you
Do I worry? Honey, you know dog-gone well I do

Am I frantic, 'cause we've lost the spark?
Is there panic when it starts turning dark?
And when evening shadows creep, do I lose any sleep over you?
Do I worry? You can bet your life I doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dream a while
We've only a while to dream
Love is sweet
But swift as a candle's gleam

Close your eyes
The music is soft and low
Dream a while
Before it is time to go

Darling, can't you see
Nothing is ever quite the same
Give your lips to me
And let our hearts burst into flame

Hold me tight
For that is the thrill supreme
Dream a while
We've only a while to dream

Dream a while
We've only a while to dream
Love is sweet
But swift as a candle's gleam
Oh, close your eyes
The music is soft and low
Dream a while
Before it is time to go

Darling, can't you see
Nothing is ever quite the same
Give your lips to me
And let our hearts burst into flame

Hold me tight
For that is the thrill supreme

I'm making believe that you're in my arms
Though I know you're so far away
Making believe I'm talking to you
Wish you could hear what I say
And here in the gloom of my lonely room
We're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming
So till my dreams come true
I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you

When I'm not playing Solitaire
I take a book down from the shelf
And what with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself

Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?
