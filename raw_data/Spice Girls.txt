Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real, don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it

Come a little bit closer, baby
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out, boy, let's work it out, boy
Any deal that we endeavour
Boys and girls feel good together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it

Are you as good as I remember, baby?
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Be a little bit wiser, baby
Put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night, when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya, baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya, baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
 
Ah, say you'll be there
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear

Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going round in circles
Tell me, will this deja vu never end? Oh

Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, ay
This time you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
(I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there
(Say you will be there)
Ow, say you will be there
A-won't you sing it with me?

If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation then
I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

I'm (I'm), giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And (and), all that I want from you (all I want from you)
Is a promise you (is a promise you) will be there
Yeah, I want you

Any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'll give you everything, on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there

I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is a promise you (want you to promise to)
Will be there (always be there)
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)

All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is a promise you (want you to promise to)
Will be there (always be there)
 
You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever

Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do
Do do-do, always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba
Ba da-ba, stay that way forever

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time
You need, less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you, wanna thank you) I need somebody with a human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much, thank you very much) Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
 
Do you still remember
How we used to be
Feeling together
Believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour
My spirit I gave ya
We'd only just begun

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes, I still remember
Every whispered word
The touch of your skin
Giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers
Like the sands of time
Promises made
Every memory saved
As reflections in my mind

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold
They will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting (everlasting), like the sun (like the sun)
Live forever (live forever), for the moment (for the moment)
Ever searching (ever searching) for the one (for the one)
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Viva forever, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one
 
The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good, as long as you're getting
What's driving you is ambition I'm betting

(I said-a) Who do you think you are?
(Do you think you are?) oh, oh, oh
(I said-a) Who, some kind of superstar?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show how good you are

You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Climbing the snake up the ladder, but you're wrong

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are

You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control

Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me

Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast

Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

What part of no don't you understand
(understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can

Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
 
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Listen, little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me

Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never change it, no, no, no
(No, no, no, no)

Just a little girl, big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (into the world), what a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never change it, no, no, no
(No, no, no, no)
You know it's time to say goodbye
(No, no, no, no)

The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never, never ever change it
(No, no, no, no) You know it's time to say goodbye
(No, no, no, no) And don't forget you can rely
(No, no, no, no) You know it's time to say goodbye
And don't forget, on me you can rely
(No, no, no, no) I will help, help you on your way
I will be with you every day
(No, no, no, no) I will be with you every day
 
She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood (Mama)
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend

I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I've had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
You're my friend

But now I'm sure I know why (I know why)
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes (see through your eyes)
All that you did was love (all I can give you is love)

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
You're my friend

Me loving you, you loving me
A love that's true, and guaranteed
Me loving you (me loving you)
You loving me (you loving me)
A love that's true (a love that's true)
And guaranteed (so true)
Me loving you (me loving you)
You loving me (you loving me)
A love that's true (a love that's true)
And guaranteed (so true)
Me loving you (me loving you)
You loving me (you loving me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

Now we got the flavour, the bad behaviour
The rhythm, the melody, the juice for you to savour
We're rockin' and vibin' but somebody is jivin'
You need to take a tip, sort it out, get a grip
Whenever I go out, wherever it may be
Never is there a Keanu, but a dweeb lookin' at me
But then even if I do score, he's a loser in the dance floor
Take a deep breath count one, two, three

Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming moves were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove? (feel the groove)
Why don't you move?
It's easy, can't you see? (can't you see?)
Take my hands and dance with me (dance with me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

Hey macho, te ví el otro día
Me dio mucha, mucha alegría
Escucha la música, ay madre mía!
Hey chico, tu no tienes nada
Que susto, que sueco, que polla, que tieso
Oh, no me toques, ay que pero, feo
Venga, venga, marcha salida
Toma esa música me cantas deprisa
Cuidado, cuidado, que chico, que loco
Toma mi ritmo, me voy contigo
Hey macho, te quiero, quiero un hombre, necesito si
Pero no tú, un hombre, hey macho
Hey macho, si no bailas esto no puedes nada conmigo

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby

Can't do nothing for me, baby (Oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa)
Nothing, baby (Oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa)
The rhythm
You can't do nothing for me, baby (Oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa)

Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming moves were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove? (feel the groove)
Why don't you move? (Oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa)
It's easy, can't you see? (can't you see?)
Take my hands and dance with me (dance with me)

If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance, if you can't dance

Naïvety and childlike left behind
Deprived of the goodness of mankind
Past encounters have made her strong
Strong enough to carry on and on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down don't need to care
Lights are low exposed and bare

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked

She knows exactly what to do with men like you
Inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from
The mystery will turn you on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down don't need to care
Lights are low exposed and bare

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked

Hello, it's me
I, I thought you'd understand
Well maybe I should have kept my big mouth shut
I guess it ain't such a pretty picture
I'd rather be hated than pitied
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination
I just want to be me

This angel's dirty face is soft
Holding on to what she had before
Not sharing secrets with any old fool
Now she's gonna keep her cool
She wants to get naked
She wants to get naked

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind

Elvis was a Kula Shaker
Marley, Ziggy, melody makers
She's a Bond babe, kick some ass
Doctor No, this girl's got class
Charlie's Angels, girls on top
Handbags, heels, their pistols rock
"Baby Love", a soul glam queen
Sing the blues, a love Supreme
(Sixties Twiggy set the pace
Way back then she had the face)

That's all in the past, legends built to last
But she's got something new
She's a power girl in a nineties world
And she knows just what to do

'Cause the lady is a vamp, she's a vixen not a tramp
She's a da da da da da da da
Come on fellas, place your bets, 'cause you ain't seen nothing yet
She's the talk of the town, she's the best, yes

Jackie O., we loved her so
So did Mr. President, as far as we know
Norma Jeane had a Seven Year Itch
Some Like It Hot to a fever pitch
Sandy, Danny, summer love
Pink Ladies, T-birds, Blue Moon above

That's all in the past, legends built to last
But she's got something new
She's a power girl in a nineties world
She's a downtown swinging dude

'Cause the lady is a vamp, she's a vixen not a tramp
She's a da da da da da da da
Come on fellas, place your bets, 'cause you ain't seen nothing yet
She's the talk of the town, she's the best, yes

Scary, Baby, Ginger, (Posh), (Sporty), yes, now that's your lot

And we hope that you enjoy the show
Thank you very much

She used to be a chancer, sparkle in the rain
Told me she needed a friend
Is she going crazy? Baby's on the way
Seems like the day never ends

Everybody needs some affection (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going

Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Bossa nova baby, heart is never soul
Shouting but he's never heard
Eyes all wide and open, the streets are paved with gold
Someone's come back on their word

Everybody needs some affection (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going

Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)

Down and dirty city, feeling outta place
Maybe you've ran out of time
He treats her like a lady, smile upon her face
Make up the last of the lines

Everybody needs some attention (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going

Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find

Treat me right, all night
Makes me feel good, like you should

Listen up, I gotta tell ya
About the ins and outs and goings-on
I wouldn't tell just anybody
About the fox that I've been chasing
He's resistant, I'm persistent
He didn't stop me from honing in
'Cause I'm a choosy not a floozy
I get my hit and then I run with it

Last time lover (lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (lover)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?

We got up and down to it (oh yeah)
Like the dirty bass in the music (uh)
I got my major chords strumming
Took some time and then we're really buzzing
First bite whet my appetite (mmhmm)
Second helping's always better
Started gettin' burning hot
I found my pride not easy
Slowed it down, I said stop

Last time lover (lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (lover)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?

Last time lover (treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (all night)
Last time lover (makes me feel good)
Lovin' undercover (like you should)
Last time lover
Last time lover (treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (all night)

Cool, sexy, ever ready
Someone fine, always steady
Gentle hands, dirty mind
Use your head and don't be blind
Words of love, they don't wash with me
What's the hard rush? No urgency you see
Crazy boy, potential lover
First and last lover, brother, ain't no other
Crazy, sweetie, cool but racy
Steady, ready, go, yes

Last time lover (lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me

The time is now or never
To fit the missing piece
To take this on together
You make me feel complete
We fall into the future
And through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads
And so it comes to pass

To go beyond the surface
To reach into your soul
This love is not demanding
My heart has told me so
I hold onto my hero (ahh, ahh, ahh)
With faith enough to fly
The power to imagine
Will keep this love alive

Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
Let's make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are here
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to Heaven
Never leave me alone (Everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (Matters when you're near)

And it feels so good
Every bell's gonna ring
Your love is alive and it's makin' me sing
I could fly, wanna cry
Want the whole world to know
We are together
Come on baby, lets go

And words yet to be spoken
Will fall upon the page
Spelling out true devotion
Is all we need to say

Let's make the headlines loud and true (Say you love me and I'll say I love you too)
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you (Just remember what simple words can do)
Let's make the headlines loud and clear (All that I have I give to you my friend)
The best things suddenly happen when you are here (Just remember, friendship never ends)
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven
Never leave me alone (Everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (Matters when you're near) (say you love me and I'll say I love you too)

Let's make the headlines true this time (Just remember what simple words can do)
There's no hiding from this magical state of mind (I feel love, I feel, I feel love)
If I lost my way you'd carry me home (I know you'd take me all the way to heaven)
Take me all the way to heaven never leave me alone (Everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (Everything matters, it really matters) (Matters when you're near)
Let's make the headlines loud and true (I feel love, I feel, I feel love)
Let's make the headlines

'Cause I'm giving it all
Yeah, I'm giving it all to you
