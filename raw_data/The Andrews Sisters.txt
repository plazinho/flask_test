Each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign
He tells the native population that civilization is fine
And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree (Eep! Eloki-pahee-sahana)
That civilization is a thing for me to see

So, bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
That no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed (Magazine? What happens?)
I see how people who are civilized bung you with automobile (You know you can get hurt that way, Daniel?)
At the movies, they have got to pay many coconuts to see (What do they see, Danny?)
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

So, bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, he's so happy in the jungle, he refuse to go
Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis, noise in my ear
So, no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here
They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train (The Tringle-lingle-hoola-humbaloo Express!)
And though it's smokey and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain (Alokoko-hosahima-hana)
When they've got two weeks vacation, they hurry to vacation ground (What do they do, Danny?)
They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round

So, bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
Don't want no jailhouse, shotgun, fish-hooks, golf clubs, I got my spears
So, no matter how they coax him (Yep!)
I'll stay right here

They have things like the atom bomb
So I think I'll stay where I am
Civilization, I'll stay right here3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
{Intro}
If you ever go down Trinidad
They make you feel so very glad
Calypso sing and make up rhyme
Guarantee you one real good fine time
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
Oh, beat it man, beat it
Since the Yankee come to Trinidad
They got the young girls all goin' mad
Young girls say they treat 'em nice
Make Trinidad like paradise
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
Oh, you vex me, you vex me
From Chicachicaree to Mona's Isle
Native girls all dance and smile
Help soldier celebrate his leave
Make every day like New Year's Eve
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
It's a fact, man, it's a fact
In old Trinidad, I also fear
The situation is mighty queer
Like the Yankee girl, the native swoon
When she hear der Bingle croon
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
Out on Manzanella Beach
G.I. romance with native peach
All night long, make tropic love
Next day, sit in hot sun and cool off
Drinkin' rum and Coca-Cola
Go down Point Koomahnah
Both mother and daughter
Workin' for the Yankee dollar
It's a fact, man, it's a fact
Rum and Coca-Cola
Rum and Coca-Cola
Workin' for the Yankee dollar3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now blowing reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the Cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot, he blows it eight to the bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playing with him
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He was the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight to the bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He blows it eight to the bar
He can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with him
The company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes them up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille
He's boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In The Mood
By Andrews Sisters
Mr. Whatchacallim, whatcha doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood, because I'm feelin' just right!
How's about a corner with a table for two?
Where the music's mellow and some gay rendezvous!
There's no chance romancin' with a blue attitude!
You've got to do some dancin' to get in the mood!
Sister Whatchacallim that's a timely idea!
Something swing-a-dilla would be good to my ear!
Everybody must agree that dancin' has charms
When you have that certain one you love in your arms!
Steppin' out with you will be a sweet interlude!
Oh build'er up for that would put me in the mood!
In the mood!
That's it!
I got it!
In the mood!
Your ear will spot it!
In the mood!
Oh what a hot hit!
Be alive
And get the jive
You've got to learn how!
Hep-hep-hep!
Hep like a hepper!
Pep-pep-pep!
Hot as a pepper!
Step-step-step!
Step like a stepper!
From muggin' to huggin'
We're in the mood now!
Mr. Watchacallim, All you needed was fun!
You can see the wonders that this evening has done!
Your feet were so heavy, till they hardly could move!
Now they're light as feathers and you're right in the groove!
You were only hungry for some musical food!
You're positively absolutely in the mood!
Sister watchacallim, I'm indebted to you!
It all goes to show what good a new hit could do!
Never felt so happy and so fully alive!
It seems that jammin' jumpin' is a powerful jive!
Swing-a-roo has given me a new attitude!
My heart is full of rhythm and I'm in the mood!
In the mood!
That's it!
'Cause I got it!
And I'm–
In the mood!
Your ear will spot it!
When you're–
In the mood!
Babababadilibidibababobo
Be alive
And get the jive
You've got to learn how!

You're Hep like a hepper!

You're hot as a pepper!
And you Step-step-step!
Step, step like a stepper!

Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no

From the guy next door to me
The girl he met just loves to pet
And it fits you to a T
So don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
With anyone else but her, no, no, no
Not a single soul but me, no, no, no

Till you see me
When you see me marching home
Then we'll go arm in arm
We'll sit down under the apple tree
Baby just you and me
When I come marching home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hello railroad, is this the railroad?
I want a one way ticket down to Tennessee
I'm leaving immediately, Chattanooga, here I come
Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
Right on track 29, boy, you can give me a shine
I can afford to board the Chattanooga choo choo
I've, I've, I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina
When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rolling
Whoo, whoo, Chattanooga, there you are
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
In, in satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga choo choo, won't you choo choo me home?
Hey, there, boy, yes, yes, yes
I'm a comin' back to Tennessee
Hey, there, boy, yes, yes, yes
I want a one way ticket on the
Chattanooga choo choo train
Hey, pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo choo choo?
Right on track 29, my baby, I'm fine
Boy, you can give me a shine
Give me a very good shine
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
All dressed up in satin and lace, oh, what a funny face
(I used to call funny face)
I used to call her just a funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam
So, Chattanooga choo choo, won't you choo choo me home!?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, tico tico, tick!
Oh, tico tico, tock!
This tico tico, he's the cuckoo in my clock
And when he says "cuckoo,"
He means it's time to woo
It's tico time for all the lovers on the block
I've got a heavy date
A tete a tete at eight
So speak, oh, tico, tell me if it's getting late?
If I'm on time, cuckoo
But, if I'm late, woo-woo!
The one my heart is gone to may not want to wait!
For just a birdie, and a birdie who goes nowhere
He knows of every lover's lane and how to go there;
For in affairs of the heart
My tico's terribly smart
He tells me: "gently, sentimentally at the start!"
Oh, oh, I hear my little tico tico calling
Because the time is right and shades of night are falling
I love that not-so-cuckoo cuckoo in the clock
Tico tico tico tico tico tock!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Of all the boys I've known and I've known some
Until I first met you I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me
You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me
Bei mir bist du schön, please let me explain
'Bei mir bist du schön' means you're grand
Bei mir bist du schön, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land
I could say 'bella, bella' even 'sehr wunderbar'
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, 'bei mir bist du schön'
So kiss me and say you understand
Bei mir bist du schön
You've heard it all before but let me try to explain
'Bei mir bist du schön' means that you're grand
'Bei mir bist du schön,' it's such an old refrain
And yet I should explain, it means I am begging for your hand
I could say 'bella, bella' even 'sehr wunderbar'
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

A certain maid I know, is so afraid her boy
Will never ask her, will she name the day
He calls on her each night, and when she dims the light
It's ten to one that you would hear her say
Oh Joseph, Joseph, won't you make your mind up
It's time I knew just how I stand with you
My heart's no clock that I can stop and wind up
Each time we make up after being through
So listen Joseph, Joseph time is fleeting
And here and there my hair is turning grey
My mother has a fear, wedding bells I'll never hear
Joseph, Joseph, won't you name the day
Oh Joseph, won't you name the day
Oh Joseph, won't you name the day
Oh Joseph, won't you name the day

A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that everything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off of his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, "Now listen, Jack"

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in divin'
What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top
The buzzard told the monkey, "You are chokin' me
Release your hold and I will set you free"
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
"Your story's so touching, it sounds just like a lie"

Let's make a break some Christmas, Dear, I know the place to go
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?
How'd ya like to stay up late, like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday
Your Christmas dreams come true

Round her neck she wore a yellow ribbon
She wore it in the winter
And the merry month of May
When I asked her: Why the yellow ribbon?
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
When, at first, she met a winsome Johnny
He wasn't sure her heart was pure
Her eyes were far too bold
So, round her neck
He tied a yellow ribbon
He tied a yellow ribbon
'Cause it matched her hair of gold
Hair of gold, hair of gold
He tied a yellow ribbon
'Cause it matched her hair of gold
Hair of gold, hair of gold
He tied a yellow ribbon
For her eyes were far too bold
If, perchance, you spy a lovely maiden
And by her side, there walks with pride
A Johnny strong and gay
And round her neck there is a yellow ribbon
No matter how you love her
Please stay far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
No matter how you love her
Please stay far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
Her love is for another
So stay far far away
Far far away
Round her neck she wore a yellow ribbon
She wore it in the winter
And the merry month of May
When I asked her: Why the yellow ribbon?
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far far away
For her lover who is far far awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar
In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all
The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
And we all know
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
The cats all holler "Hooray"
You'll hear them say, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
When he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler, "Beat me up Daddy, beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
The people gather around when he gets up on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there ever bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
A-plink plink, a-plank plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff riff, a-raff raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
