Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
 
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like
To be hated, to be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool
And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
 
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said "You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away"
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Who are you?
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh

Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who  are you?
Who, who, who, who?

I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me whoa are you(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me, tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, come on, who? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, tell me who are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know
Oh, I really wanna know
Come on tell me, who are you, you, you, you?
Who are you?
 
We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song

I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

Change, it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No, no

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half-alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do you?


Yeah
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are effaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no


Yeah
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
 
Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
 
People try to put us d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)

Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
Well the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
She's playin' all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
So you think '21
Is going to be a good year?
It could be good for me and her
But you and her, no, never!
I had no reason to be over-optimistic
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
What about the boy?

He saw it all!
You didn't hear it

{Intro}
I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way
Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say
That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you got to stand trial
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
{Bridge}
I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze
Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles

Athena, I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena, all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll  get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Athena, my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed, there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

I'm happy, I'm ecstatic
Just a girl, just a girl
She's just a girl

Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena, you picked me up by my lapels and screamed "leave her"
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep, I didn't mean that

She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it, please
She's a bomb

Athena, I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
She's just a girl, she's a bomb
 
You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah
Substitute your lies for fact
I see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by
Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done

Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy
And I became aware this year
If you want to follow me
You've got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs
Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you getting drunk
So sorry, I got you sussed
Hey you smoking mother nature
This is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal
Don't try to gain my trust
Cause you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways
Although you think you must

We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
We're not going to take it
Going to break it
Going to shake it
Let's forget it better still

Now you can't hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
Your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie
To guide you to
Your very own machine

We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take you
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still

We forsake you
Going to rape you
Let's forget you better still
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me

I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well

But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away

And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

I know if I go, things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned, but her folks wouldn't let her

I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well

But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright


Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away

And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
 
Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey

The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy


The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy

I saw yer!
 
Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields

Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me

Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me, rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me, rain o'er me

On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool cool rain
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain


Love reign o'er me
Rain over me, over me, over me
Oh, love reign o'er me
O'er me

Love
 
My life's in jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I ain't been home since Friday night
And now my wife is coming after me
Give me police protection
I'm gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard, a black belt Judo expert
With a machine gun

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me, won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots
And take a long, long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive

All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law
And now I ain't got time to think

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me, won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots
And take a long, long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive

And I'm oh-so tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
I've gotta rest some time
So I can get to run some more, yeah

She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
 
Why should I care?
Why should I care?

Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau de Cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women
Magically bored on a quiet street corner
Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water, m-m-my generation
Uppers and downers, either way blood flows

(Inside outside) Leave me alone
(Inside outside) Nowhere is home
(Inside outside) Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train

On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
Back of a lorry
Holy hitching
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in the war
Birthday punching
He man drag in a glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous in my high heel shoes
Tightly undone, know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic that their heros are news

(Inside outside) Leave me alone
(Inside outside) Nowhere is home
(Inside outside) Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train

Why should I care?
Why should I care?
 
I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

I'm free, I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free, I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

How can we follow?
How can we follow?
