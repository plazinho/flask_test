You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So, if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm gonna buy a paper doll that I can call my own
A doll that other fellows cannot steal
And then the flirty, flirty guys with their flirty, flirty eyes
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real
When I come home at night she will be waiting
She'll be the truest doll in all this world
I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own
Than have a fickle-minded real live girl
I guess I had a million dolls or more
I guess I've played the doll game o'er and o'er
I just quarreled with Sue, that's why I'm blue
She's gone away and left me just like all dolls do
I'll tell you boys, it's tough to be alone
And it's tough to love a doll that's not your own
I'm through with all of them, I'll never fall again
Say boy, whatcha gonna do?
I'm gonna buy a paper doll that I can call my own
A doll that other fellows cannot steal
And then the flirty, flirty guys with their flirty, flirty eyes
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real
When I come home at night she will be waiting
She'll be the truest doll in all this world
I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own
Than have a fickle-minded real live girl1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river with me
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new mornin'
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new mornin'
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river with me
Oh, up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river with me
Up a lazy river with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You're the end of the rainbow, my pot of gold
You're daddy's little girl to have and to hold
A precious gem is what you are
You're mommy's bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas, my star on the tree
You're the Easter Bunny to mommy and me
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice
And you're daddy's little girl
You're the treasure I cherish, so sparkling and bright
You were touched by the holy and beautiful light
Like angels that sing, a heavenly thing
And you're daddy's little girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Till then, my darling, please wait for me
Till then, no matter when it will be
One day, I know I'll be back again
Please wait, till then
Our dreams will live though we are apart
Our love, I know it'll keep in our hearts
Till then, when all the world will be free
Please wait for me
Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time
Till then, let's dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till then
Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time
Till then, let's dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till thenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who sang a sort of Indian "Hi-de-ho"
To the people passin' by
The pinto spent his time a-swishin' flies
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passin' by
One day, they went a-walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not a-lookin'
Toot, toot, they never came back
Oh, across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an Indian "Hi-de-ho"
To the people passin' by
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto a-pony and a Navajo
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough
For the people passin' by
They thought that they would make some easy bucks
By washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux
A pair of very conscientious clucks
To the people passin' by
Then they took this cheap vacation
Their shoes were polished bright
Though they never heard the whistle
Toot, toot, they're clear out of sight
Oh, across the alley from the Alamo
When the starlight beams its tender glow
The beams go to sleep and then there ain't no dough
For the people passin' by
One day, they went a-walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not a-lookin'
Toot, toot, they never came back
Oh, across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an Indian "Hi-de-ho"
To the people passin' by
Across the alley from the AlamoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Lead us lest too far we wander
Love's sweet voice is callin' yonder
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Hey, there don't get dimmer, dimmer
Light the path below, above
And lead us on to love
Glow little glow-worm, fly of fire
Glow like an incandescent wire
Glow for the female of the species
Turn on the AC and the DC
This night could use a little brightnin'
Light up you little ol' bug of lightnin'
When you gotta glow, you gotta glow
Glow little glow-worm, glow
Glow little glow-worm, glow and glimmer
Swim through the sea of night, little swimmer
Thou aeronautical boll weevil
Illuminate yon woods primeval
See how the shadows deep and darken
You and your chick should get to sparkin'
I got a gal that I love so
Glow little glow-worm, glow
Glow little glow-worm, turn the key on
You are equipped with tail-light neon
You've got a cute vest-pocket master
Which you can make both slow and faster
I don't know who you took a shine to
Or who you're out to make a sign to
I got a gal, that I love so
Glow little glow-worm, glow
Glow little glow-worm, glow
Glow little glow-worm, glowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Where do they go? The smoke rings I blow each night
Oh what do they do those circles of blue and white?
Why do they seem to picture a dream of ______
Why do they fade that phantom parade of love
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff Night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow blow them everywhere give your troubles wings
Oh little smoke rings I love
Please take me above
Take me with you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Cab Driver, drive by Mary's place
I just wanna chance to see her face
Don't stop the meter, let it race
Cab Driver, drive by Mary's place
Cab Driver, once more round the block
Never mind the ticking of the clock
I only wish we could have a talk
Cab Driver, once more round the block
Cab Driver, once more down the street
There's a little place we used to meet
That's where I laid my future at her feet
Cab Driver, once more down the street
Cab Driver, wait here by the door
Perhaps I'll hold her in my arms once more
Then thing's will be just like before
Cab Driver, wait here by the door
Cab Driver, better take me home
I guess that I was meant to be alone
I hope God sends me a love one of my own
Cab Driver, better take me home
Cab Driver, better take me home!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh, baby, I'm a-rackin' my brain, to think of a name
To give to this tune, so Perry can croon
And maybe old Bing will give it a fling
And that'll start everyone hummin' the thing
The melody's dumb, repeat and repeat
But if you can swing, it's got a good beat
And that's the main thing, to make it complete
'Cause everyone's swingin' today
So we call it 'Opus One'
It's not for Sammy Kaye, hey, hey, hey
It's 'Opus One'
It's got to swing, not sway, baby
If Mr. Les Brown can make it renowned
And Ray Anthony could rock it for me
There's never a doubt, you'll knock yourself out
Whenever you get near 'Opus One'
I'm rackin' my brain to think of a name
To give to this tune, so Perry can croon
And maybe old Bing will give it a fling
And that'll start everyone hummin' the thing
The melody's dumb, repeat and repeat
But if you can swing, it's got a good beat
And that's the main thing, to make it complete
'Cause everyone's swingin' today
So we call it 'Opus One'
It's not for Sammy Kaye, hey, hey, hey
It's 'Opus One'
It's got to swing, not sway, baby
If Mr. Les Brown can make it renowned
And Ray Anthony could rock it for me
No doubt out, it's 'Opus One'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put on your old gray bonnet with the blue ribbon on it
And we'll hitch old Dobbin to the shay
Through the fields of clover
We'll go down to Dover on our golden wedding day
Old gray bonnet, ribbon on it
Old Dobbin, shay
Fields of clover, down to Dover
Gold wedding day
Put on your old gray bonnet with the blue ribbon on it
Hitch old Dobbin to the shay
Through the fields of clover
We gotta go down to Dover on our golden wedding day

Maybe I'm right, and maybe I'm wrong
And maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Somehow I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking
Oh maybe I'll live a life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you
Somehow I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking
Oh maybe I'll live a life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you
But nevertheless, I'm in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Every star above
Knows the one I love
Sweet Sue, sweet Sue
And the moon up high
Knows the reason why
Sweet Sue - just you!
No one else it seems
Ever shared my dreams
And without you, dear, I don't know what I'd do
In this heart of mine
You live all the time
Sweet Sue, sweet Sue

Where the lights are low

Any time you're Lambeth way
Any evening, any day
You'll find us all
Doin' the Lambeth walk
Ev'ry little Lambeth gal
With her little Lambeth pal
You'll find 'em all
Doin' the Lambeth walk
Ev'rything free and easy
Do as darn well pleasey
Why don't you make your way there?
Go there, stay there
Once you get down Lambeth way
Ev'ry evening, ev'ry day
You'll find yourself
Doin' the Lambeth walkEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The old man of the mountain
Old man in the mountain
With his long white beard
And his crooked step
He tramps along
While the folks all laugh
With a twinkle in his eye
He passes them by
The old man of the mountain
He wears long hair
But his feet are bent
They say he's mad as an old march hare
His cares are not any
And he owes no one
The old man of the mountain
He talks to the birds when he's lonely
He sleeps with the stars for a tent
And the bees spread a feast when he's hungry
And God charges no rent
He'll live as long as an old oak tree
And laugh at fools like you and me
I often sigh and wish that I were
The old man of the mountain
With his long white beard
And his crooked step
(skat)
The old man of mountain
He wears long hair
And his feet are bent
(Skat)
The old man of mountain
He talk with the birds when he's lonely
Sleeps with the stars in his tent
(Skat)
The old man of the mountain
(skat)
Old man of the mountain

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me-ee
Up a lazy river where the robin's so-ong

Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles

Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me
Woh, up a lazy river by the o-old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noo-oon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your-our troubles
Dream a dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robi-in's song
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be

You're nobody's sweetheart now
There's no place for you somehow
Fancy clothes, silken gowns
You'll be out of place in your own home town
As you walk down the avenue
All the people won't believe that's you
With painted lips and painted eyes
Wearing a big bird of paradise
It don't seem wise somehow
You're nobody's sweetheart nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
