Does she love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe her
When she tells me so?
Is she fooling?
Is it all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?
A one-sided love
Would break my heart
She may be just acting
An' playing a part
If she don't love me
Let her tell me so
I can't hold her
If she wants to go
Though I'll cry when she's gone
I won't die, I-I'll live ( (on.) )
If it's so, it's too soon
Way too soon to knoo-o-o-o-ow
Does she love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe her
When she tells me so?
Is she fooling?
Is it all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?
Though I'll cry when she's gone
I won't die, I-I-I-'ll live ( (on.) )
If it's so, it's too soon
Way too soon to know-ooh
(Know-ooh.)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind
Now, I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Love you, love you, love you
Oh, for just the chance to love you
Would I love you, love you, love you
To take you in my arms
Has always been my goal
Sure as there's a moon above you
Would I love you, love you, love you
With all my heart and soul
With all my heart and soul
You ask me, would I love you if you let me
Eyes that see are eyes that know
Would I love you? What a question
When I'm yearning so
Oh, for just the chance to love you
Would I love you, love you, love you
To take you in my arms
Has always been my goal
Sure as there's a moon above you
Would I love you, love you, love you
With all my heart and soul

Maybe it's much too early in the game
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you all the same
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
Wonder who's arms are holding you so tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock at night
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you recieve
Well, but just in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance

Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(I love you)
Yes, they keep telling "Be sensible with your new love"
"Well, this won't be the last, you'll find"
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms
And drive me slowly out of my mind
Oh, kiss me (Kiss me)
And when you do I know that you will
Miss me (Miss me) if we ever say "adieu"
So kiss me, kiss me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

Till then, my darling, please wait for me
Till then, no matter when it may be
One day I know I'll be home again
Please wait till then
Our dreams will live though we are apart
Our love will always stay in our hearts
Till then, when all the world will be free
Please wait for me
Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time
Till then, we'll dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till thenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say "Good night" until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it
For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know
(instrumental interlude)
So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we knowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

Play with fire 'til your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me

For when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been through it all for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling come to me

Don't go to strangers, come to meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'll never be the one to part
You've found a place here in my heart
Go have your fun, runaround
I'll never leave you, I'm forever bound
The streets are noisy, I'm all alone
I sit and wait, Dear, for you to phone
Go have your fun
Go have your fun, runaround
I've waited so long it seems
You vanished out of my dreams
Maybe a new love you've found
Settle down, runaround
I'll never be the one to part
You've found a place here in my heart
Go have your fun, go have your fun, runaround
Have your fun, runaroundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
