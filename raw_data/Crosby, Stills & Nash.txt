Helplessly hoping
Her harlequin hovers nearby
Awaiting a word
Gasping at glimpses
Of gentle true spirit
He runs, wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of good-bye

Wordlessly watching
He waits by the window
And wonders
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries
Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?

They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other

Stand by the stairway
You'll see something
Certain to tell you confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying
It's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud
"I am lonely"

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Remember what we've said and done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard


Tearing yourself away from me now--you are free
And I am crying
This does not mean I don't love you--I do, that's forever
Yes and for always
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key to your heart
And I love you

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?
Can I tell it like it is? (help me, I'm suffering)
Listen to me, baby
It's my heart that's suffering, it's a-dying (help me, I'm suffering)
And that's what I have to lose

I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?


Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing a song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow
Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she's so free
How can you catch the sparrow?
Lacy, lilting lyrics
Losing love, lamenting
Change my life, make it right
Be my lady

Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands
Sailing a reach before a following sea
She was making for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete
Off the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline
Nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized
Why twice you ran away

(I think about)
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me
Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)

I have been around the world (Looking)
Looking for that woman-girl
(And I know she knows)
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
'Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But it's as big as the promise
The promise of a coming day
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a-dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you
Tied with a silver chain
I have my ship
And all her flags are a-flying
She is all that I have left
And music is her name

(I think about)
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me
Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)

I have been around the world (Looking)
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
And you know it will
(Yes)
So we cheated and we lied and we tested
And we never failed to fail
It was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine
Will come along, make me forget about loving you
In the Southern Cross3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If you smile at me, I will understand
Cause that is something everybody everywhere does
In the same language
I can see by your coat, my friend
You're from the other side
There's just one thing I got to know
Can you tell me please, who won?
Say, can I have some of your purple berries?
Yes, I've been eating them for six or seven weeks now
Haven't got sick once
Probably keep us both alive
Wooden ships on the water, very free and easy
Easy, you know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline, let us be
Talkin' 'bout very free and easy
Horror grips us as we watch you die
All we can do is echo your anguished cries
Stare as all human feelings die
We are leaving, you don't need us
Go, take your sister then, by the hand
Lead her away from this foreign land
Far away, where we might laugh again
We are leaving, you don't need us
And it's a fair wind blowin' warm
Out of the south over my shoulder
Guess I'll set a course and go2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Forgive me if my fantasies might seem a little shopworn
I'm sure you've heard it all before I wonder what's the right form
Love songs written for you it's been going down for years
But to sing what's in my heart seems more honest than the tears
I am curious
Don't want to hurry us
I'm intrigued with us
Ain't this song a bust
I don't care dark star
I met you several years ago
The times they were so strange but I had a feeling
You looked into my eyes just once
An instant flashing by that we were stealing
Another time you felt so bad
And I wasn't any help at all as I recall
We didn't know quite what to do so we left the wanting be
Still there for me and you
Dark star I see you in the morning
Dark star a' sleeping next to me
Dark star let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me dark star
It's easy to be with you
Even with the storms that rage beneath your search for peace
We must make some time together
Take the kids and find a world that's ours to keep
Now you've got me dreaming girl
It's been so long that I thought that I'd forgotten how
My heart is once again my soul
We touched we did you know we did no more teasing now
Dark star I see you in the morning
Dark star a' sleeping next to me
Dark star let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me dark star
Dark star I see you in the morning
Dark star a' sleeping next to me
Dark star let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me dark star
Let the memory of the evening
Be the first thing that you think of
When you open up your smile and see me dark star1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Yes, a long, long, long, long time before the dawn

Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say
You know that somethin' is goin' on around here
It surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day, no

And it appears to be a long (Yes it does)
Appears to be a long (Mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long time before the dawn

Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness
You got to speak your mind, if you dare
But don't—no, don't no—try to get yourself elected
If you do you had better cut your hair, mm
And it appears to be a long (Yes it does)
Appears to be a long (Mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn, yeah

It's been a (Long) long (Time) time (Comin') comin'
It's going to be (Long) a long (Time) time (Gone) gone
But you know the darkest hour
Is always, always just before the dawn

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Whoopa, hey mesa, hooba huffa, hey meshy goosh goosh

Looking at the world through the sunset in your eyes
Traveling the train through clear Moroccan skies
Ducks and pigs and chickens call, animal carpet wall to wall
American ladies five-foot tall in blue

Sweeping cobwebs from the edges of my mind
Had to get away to see what we could find
Hope the days that lie ahead bring us back to where they've led
Listen not to what's been said to you

Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
All aboard the train, all aboard the train

I've been saving all my money just to take you there
I smell the garden in your hair

Take the train from Casablanca going South
Blowing smoke rings from the corners of my mouth
Colored cottons hang in the air
Charming cobras in the square
Striped djellabas we can wear at home
Well, let me hear ya now
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
Would you know we're riding on the Marrakesh Express?
They're taking me to Marrakesh
All aboard the train, all aboard the train, all aboardEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Forty Nine reasons all in a line
All of them good ones
All of them lies
Driftin' with my lady
We're oldest of friends
Need a little work, and there's fences to mend
Steady girl, be my world
`Till the drifter come, now she's gone
I let that man play his hand
I let them go, how was I to know?
I'm down on my knees
Nobody left to please
Now it's over, they left in the spring
Her and the drifter, looking for beautiful things
Steady girl, be my world
`Till the drifter come, now she's gone
I let that man play his hand
I let them go, how was I to know?
I'm down on my knees
Nobody left to please
On my knees
Feeling wrong
Mama's gone
Bye bye baby
Write if you think of it, maybe
Know I love you (Know I love you)
Go if it means that much to you
Hey, but you can run, baby
If the feeling's wrong before too long it's crazy
And you're trapped, babe
And you know that's not where it's at, babe
You're just seein' things through a cat's eye, baby
That's not my old lady
Come on and tell me, baby
You better tell me, baby
Who do you
Who do you love?
Time will tell us
Who is trying to sell us
Bye, bye, baby
Write if you think of it, maybe
Hey, but you can run, baby
If the feeling's wrong, before too long, it's crazy
And you're trapped babe
And you know that's not where it's at baby
You're just seein' things through a cat's eye, baby
That's not my old lady
Come on and tell me, baby
You better tell me, baby
Who do you
Who do you love?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In the mornin' when you rise
Do you think of me and how you left me cryin'?
Are you thinkin' of telephones, and managers
And where you got to be at noon?
You are living a reality I left years ago
It quite nearly killed me
In the long run it will make you cry
Make you crazy and old before your time
And the difference between me and you
I won't argue right or wrong
But I have time to cry, my baby

You don't have to cry
I said cry my baby
You don't have to cry
I said cry my baby
You don't have to cry

In the mornin' when you rise
Do you think of me and how you left me cryin'?
Are you thinkin' of telephones, and managers
And where you got to be at noon?
You are living a reality I left years ago
It quite nearly killed me
In the long run it will make you cry
Make you crazy and old before your time
And the difference between me and you

But I have time to cry, my baby
You don't have to cry

Guinnevere had green eyes
Like yours, milady, like yours
She'd walk down through the garden
In the morning after it rained
Peacocks wandered aimlessly
Underneath an orange tree
Why can't she see me?

Guinnevere drew pentagrams
Like yours, milady, like yours
Late at night when she thought
That no one was watching at all
On the wall
She shall be free

As she turns her gaze
Down the slope to the harbor where I lay
Anchored for a day

Guinnevere had golden hair
Like yours, milady, like yours
Streaming out when we'd ride
Through the warm wind down by the bay
Yesterday
Seagulls circle endlessly
I sing in silent harmony
We shall be free1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
6 o'clock in the morning, I feel pretty good
So I dropped into the luxury of the Lords
Fighting dragons and crossing swords
With the people against the hordes who came to conquer
7 o'clock in the morning, here it comes
I taste the warning and I am so amazed
I'm here today, seeing things so clear this way
In the car and on my way to Stonehenge
I'm flying in Winchester cathedral
Sunlight pouring through the break of day
Stumbled through the door and into the chamber
There's a lady setting flowers on a table covered lace
And a cleaner in the distance finds a cobweb on a face
And a feeling deep inside of me tells me this can't be the place
Come flying in Winchester cathedral
All religion has to have its day
Expressions on the face of the Saviour
Made me say, "I can't stay"
Open up the gates of the church and let me out of here
Too many people have lied in the name of Christ
For anyone to heed the call
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all
And now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died it was a birthday and I noticed it was mine
And my head didn't know just who I was
And I went spinning back in time
And I am high upon the altar, high upon the altar, high
I'm flying in Winchester cathedral
It's hard enough to drink the wine
The air inside just hangs in delusion
But given time, I'll be fine
Open up the gates of the church and let me out of here
Too many people have lied in the name of Christ
For anyone to heed the call
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all
Now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died it was a birthday and I noticed it was mine
And my head didn't know just who I was
And I went spinning back in time
And I am high upon the altar, high upon the altar, highEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Holding you close undisturbed before a fire
The pressure in my chest when you breathe in my ear
We both knew this would happen when you first appeared
My lady of the island

The brownness of your body in the fire glow
Except the places where the sun refused to go
Our bodies were a perfect fit, in afterglow we lay
My lady of the island

Letting myself wander through the world inside your eyes
You know I'd like to stay here until every tear runs dry
My lady of the island

Wrapped around each other in the peepin' sun
Beams of sunshine light the stage, the red light's on
I never want to finish what I've just begun with you
My lady of the islandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Look around me
I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way it used to be
I am older now
I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started
Long before I did

And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away


Oh, when you were young
Did you question all the answers?
Did you envy all the dancers
Who had all the nerve?
Look round you now
You must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved
So much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
So much love to make up
Everywhere you turn
Love we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
Let the water come and carry us awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Just a song before I go
To whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned

When the shows were over
We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone

She helped me with my suitcase
She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies

Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love
And she was gone

Just a song before I go
A lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burnedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She has seen me changing
It ain't easy rearranging
And it gets harder as you get older
Farther away as you get closer
And I don't know the answer
Does it even matter?
I'm wonderin' how
Ten years singing right out loud
I never looked was anybody listening
Then I fell out of a cloud
I hit the ground and noticed something missing
Now I have someone
She has seen me changing
And it gets harder as you get older
And farther away as you get closer
And I don't know the answer
Does it even matter?
I'm wonderin' how
Seems like something out of a dream
I had years ago yes, I remember screaming
Nobody laughing all the good times
Getting harder to come by without weeping
Now I have someone
She has seen me changing
And it gets harder as you get older
And farther awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Daylight again
Following me to bed
I think about a hundred years ago
How my fathers bled
I think I see a valley
Covered with bones in blue
All the brave soldiers that cannot get older
Been asking after you
Hear the past a-calling
From Armageddon's side
When everyone's talking and no one is listening
How can we decide
Do we find the cost of freedom
Buried in the ground
Mother Earth will swallow you
Lay your body downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Waking stream of consciousness
On a sleeping street of dream
Thoughts like scattered leaves
Slowed in midfall to the streams
Of fast running rivers of choice and chance and time stops here
On the delta
While they dance while they dance
I love the child who steers this riverboat
But lately he's crazy for the deep
The river seems dreamlike in the daytime
Someone keeps thinking in my sleep
Of fast running rivers of choice and chance and time stops here
On the delta
While they dance while they dance
While they danceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
One morning I woke up and I knew
You were really gone
A new day, a new way, and new
Eyes to see the dawn
Go your way, I'll go mine and
Carry on
The sky is clearing and the night
Has cried enough
The sun, he come, the world
To soften up
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice but
To carry on
The fortunes of fables are able
To see the stars
Now witness the quickness with which
We carry on
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues and
Carry on
Carry on
Love is coming
Love is coming to us all
Where are you going now my love?
Where will you be tomorrow?
Will you bring me happiness?
Will you bring me sorrow?
Are they questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Lover can you talk to me?
Girl when I was on my own
Chasing you down
What was it made you run?
Trying your best just to get around
The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Lover can you talk to me?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I have kissed you
So I'll miss you
On the road I'll be wantin' you
But I have you
'Cause I love you
And you have me 'cause you love me too, yeah
Felt forsaken
You'll awaken
To the joys of livin' hand in glove
And then I will
Lend you my will
And your days will be filled with love
Don't run, the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches
Felt rejected
As expected
You rejected all the thoughts of words
So I'll pray with
You to stay with
Me forever and we'll make it work, whoa-oh-oh!
Elevated
You're elated
'Cause I've waited a year for you
If you're thinkin'
What I'm thinkin'
Then I'm gonna make my love to you, whoa-oh-oh!
Don't run, the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roachesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
