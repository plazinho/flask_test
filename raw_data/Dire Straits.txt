You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"
 
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack"
He's underneath the window
She's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?"

"Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet"

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"

"Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet"

"I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time"

"Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet"

And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
"You and me babe, how about it?"
 
These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones


Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
 
Woo-ho
Woo-ho

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, baby what I say
Here comes Johnny singing "I got a woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Woo-ho

Here comes Johnny gonna tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat, the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Woo-ho-ho

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, baby what I say
Here comes Johnny singing "I gotta woman"
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Mmm, they do the walk of life

Woo-ho
Woo-ho-ho
Woo-ho-ho
Woo-ho
Woo-ho-ho
 
Getting crazy on the waltzers
But it's the life that I choose
Hey, sing about the sixblade, sing about the switchback
And a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races, yeah
Just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever
Said: "Let it rock and let it roll"
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love

It's just the danger, danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said: "You are the perfect stranger"
She said: "Baby, let's keep it like this"
It's just a cake walk, twisting baby, yeah, step right up and say:
"Hey Mister, give me two, give me two now, 'cos any two can play"

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

Well, it's been money for muscle on another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big
And rockaway, rockaway
Oh, rockaway, rockaway

And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Hey girl, it looks so pretty to me
Just like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Check it out!


She took off a silver locket
She said: "Remember me by this"
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love, love, love
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway, rockaway
Rockaway, rockaway
From Cullercoats and Whitley Bay
Out to rockaway

And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
 
A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load
Where he thought it was the best
He made a home in the wilderness
He built a cabin and a winter store
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travelers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no
They never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river


And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow


I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work
But there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap
From some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the telegraph road

You know, I'd sooner forget
But I remember those nights
When life was just a bet on a race
Between the lights
You had your head on my shoulder
You had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder
Like you don't seem to care

But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't want to see it again
From all of these signs saying, "sorry, but we're closed"
All the way
Down the telegraph road
 
All the late night bargains have been struck
Between the satin beaus and their belles
Prehistoric garbage trucks
Have the city to themselves
Echoes and roars of dinosaurs
They're all doing the monster mash
And most of the taxis and most of the whores
Are only taking calls for cash, mmm

I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

Well now, my door was standing open
Security was laid back and lax
But it was only my heart got-a broken
You must have had a pass key made out of wax
You played robbery with insolence
And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lovers' Lane
And you never did have the intelligence to use
The twelve keys hanging off of my chain

I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

Well, now it's past last call for alcohol
Past recall has been here and gone
The landlord, he finally paid us all
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
And we're standing outside of this wonderland
Looking so bereaved and so bereft
Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left, mmm

I don't know how it happened
It was faster than the eye could flick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick
 
Baby, I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
And turn your blue skies into grey

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?


Baby, when I get down I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
I know it isn't hard to say
But baby, just when this world seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?
 
Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun goes down?
You're so far away from me

You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright

I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
Cause you're so far away from me

You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright

And I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me
See, you've been in the sun, and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me

You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, take it down

You're so far away from me
(You're so far)
Oh, you're so far away from me
Yeah, you're so far away from me
So far away from me
(You're so far)
And you're so far away from me
So far away from me
(You're so far)
So far away from me
Oh, so far away from me
You're so far away from me
So far away from me
(You're so far)
So far away from me, yeah
So far away from me
(You're so far), right
(You're so far)
You're just so far away from me
 
Last time I was sober, man I felt bad
Worst hangover that I ever had
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right

Cause if you want to run cool
If you want to run cool
If you want to run cool, you got to run
On heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel

My life makes perfect sense
Lust and food and violence
Sex and money are my major kicks
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks

Cause if you want to run cool
If you want to run cool
If you want to run cool, you got to run
On heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel

My chick loves a man who's strong
The things she'll do to turn me on
I love the babes, don't get me wrong
Hey, that's why I wrote this song

I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead
When my ugly big car won't climb this hill
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill

Cause if you want to run cool
If you want to run cool
If you want to run cool, you got to run
On heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
Heavy, heavy fuel
 
Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectation left to come up to, yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah, she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You'd talk to me when you felt like it

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd a call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus your mother was a Jazz singer


Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Oh, yeah
Another time, another place

Lady writer on the TV (Lady writer on the TV)
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the
Lady writer on the TV (Lady writer on the TV)
Talking about the Virgin Mary (Lady writer)
Yeah, you know I'm talking about you and me (Lady writer on the TV)
And the lady writer on the TV
Take it to the lady writer on the TV (Lady writer on the TV)
Talking about the Virgin Mary (lady writer)
Yeah, you know I'm talking about you and me (Lady writer on the TV)
And the lady writer on the TV

(Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV

Stepping out to Angelucci's
For my coffee beans
Checking out the movies and the magazines
Waitress she watches me
Crossing from the Barocco Bar
I get a pickup for my steel guitar
I saw you walking out Shaftesbury Avenue
Excuse me for talking I wanna marry you
This is the seventh heaven street to me
Don't you seem so proud
You're just another angel
In the crowd and I'm...

Walking in the wild west end
Walking in the wild west end
Walking with your wild best friend

Now my conductress on the number nineteen
She was a honey (she was a honey)
Pink toenails and hands all dirty with the money
Greasy, greasy, greasy hair, easy smile
She made me feel nineteen for a while
I went down to Chinatown
In the backroom it's a man's world
All the money go down
Duck inside the doorway, duck to eat
Just ain't no way
You and me, we can't beat

Walking in the wild west end
Walking in the wild west end
Walking with your wild best friend

Darling a gogo dancing girl
Yes I saw her
The DJ he say here's Mandy for ya
I feel alright, saying now, do that stuff
She's dancing high I move on by
The close ups can get rough

When you're walking in the wild west end
Walking, walking, walking in the wild west end
Walking, walking with your wild best friend
Walking, walking in the..
 
Sweet surrender on the Quayside
You remember we used to run and hide
In the shadow of the cargoes
I take you one at a time
And we're counting all the numbers
Down to the waterline

Well, near misses on the dogleap stairways
French kisses in the darkened doorways
A foghorn blowing out wild and cold
A policeman, he shines a light upon my shoulder

Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night
Over my shoulder all you can see
Are the pilot lights
No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn
Your hands are cold but your lips are warm


She can see him on the jetty that
They used to know
She can feel him in the places where
The sailors go
When she's walking by the river
Or the railway line
She can still hear him whisper
Let's go down to the waterline, c'mon
 
Your six blade knife can do anything for you
Anything you want it to
One blade for breaking my heart
One blade for tearing me apart
Your six blade knife-do anything for you

You can take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
When you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame
Just so you could make me tame
You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin

I'd like to be free of it babe, I don't want it no more
I'd like to be free of it now, I don't want it no more


Everybody got a knife it can be just what they want it to be
A needle,  a wife, or something that you just can't see

Your six blade knife, you're strong
Yes and it'll do me wrong
Your six blade knife - do anything for you

Do anything, anything for you
Anything
 
I'm a soldier of freedom in the army of the men
We are the chosen, we're the partisan, alright
Well the cause it is noble and the cause it is just
We are ready to pay with our lives if we must

Gonna ride across the river, deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side

I'm a soldier of fortune, I'm a dog of war, yeah
And we don't give a damn-a who the killing is for
It's the same old story with a different name
Death or glory, it's the killing game

Gonna ride across the river deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side


Oh, nothing gonna stop them
As the day follows the night
Right becomes wrong, the left becomes the right
And they sing as they march
With their flags unfurled
Today in the mountains, tomorrow the world

Gonna ride across the river,  deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side
Gonna ride across the river, deep and wide
Ride across the river to the other side
 
It's a mystery to me, the game commences
For the usual fee, plus expenses
Confidential information, it's in a diary
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry

I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason, I still can't get used to it

And what have you got at the end of the day?
What have you got to take away?
A bottle of whisky and a new set of lies
Blinds on the windows, and a pain behind the eyes


Scarred for life, no compensation
Private investigations
 
There's gotta be a record of you someplace
You gotta be on somebody's books
The lowdown a picture of your face
Your injured looks
The sacred and profane
The pleasure and the pain
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street
A ladykiller regulation tattoo
Silver spurs on his heels
Says "What can I tell you as I'm standing next to you"
She threw herself under my wheels
Oh it's a dangerous road
And a hazardous load
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street
A three-chord symphony crashes into space
The moon is hanging upside down
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case
It's a ravenous town
And you still refuse to be traced
Seems to me such a waste
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street
Yeah it's your face I'm looking for on every street
 
I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah, here she comes
Queen rollerball
Enchanté, what can I say?
Don't care at all
You know, she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
And the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, "Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son"
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long

Come slipping and sliding
Yeah, life's a roller ball
Slipping and a-sliding
Skateaway, that's all
Skateaway
Shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
Now shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
She's singing, "Shala, shalay, hey hey"
Skateaway
Shala, shalay
 
I am just an aging drummer boy
And in the wars I used to play
And I've called a tune
To many a torture session
Now they say I am a war criminal
And I'm fading away
Father, please hear my confession

I have legalized robbery
Called it belief
I have a-run with the money
I have hid like a thief
Re-written history
With my armies and my crooks
Invented memories
I did burn all the books

And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The man's too big
The man's too strong

Well I've tried to be meek
I have tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman
And I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls
That have made me alone
Striven for peace
Which I never have known

And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The man's too big
The man's too strong

Well, the sun rose on the courtyard
And they all did hear him say
"You always was a Judas
But I got you anyway
You may have got your silver
But I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds
And I gave them to your wife"

Oh, Father please help me
For I have done wrong
The man's too big
The man's too strong
