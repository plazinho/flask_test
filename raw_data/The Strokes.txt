They've been sayin' you're sophisticated
They're complainin', overeducated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify and shame us
We can't help it if we are a problem
We are tryin' hard to get your attention
I'm climbin' up your wall
Climbin' up your wall

Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing, but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you


You were waitin' for the elevator
You were sayin' all the words I'm dreaming
No more askin', questions, or excuses
The information's here
Here and everywhere

Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don’t make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and but

I don't, I don't want anything
I know it's not, it's not your fault
I don't want anyone
As I do it's not for you

Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ooh, ooh

Stockholders
Same shit, a different life
I'll get it right sometime
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight

Yeah boy, here we go
And a one, and a two, and a three
Here we go friends (Hold on, I can't)
Maybe that's a kooky situation
So let's go back to the old key, old tempo, everything
 
In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand; together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time

(Trying, trying)

And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, "Fate, my friend, you say the strangest things
I find sometimes"

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit, I will try my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand; together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
I ain't wasting no more time
 
Up on his horse, up on his horse
Not gonna wake up here anymore
Listen one time, it's not the truth
It's just a story I tell to you
Easy to say, easy to do
But it's not easy, well, maybe for you
Hope that you find it, hope that it's good
Hope that you read it, think that you should
Cuts you some slack as he sits back
Sizes you up, plans his attack

Da-da-da
Drums please, Fab

And I got it all, I got it all
Waitin' for me down on the street
But now you gotta do somethin' special for me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine

Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back
I will not show my teeth too quick
I needed you there, I needed you there
But I didn't know, I didn't know

Go alone
I'll go alone
We'll go alone
I'll go alone

Back from his trip, he's at the door
When he gets back, he's on the phone
Innocent eye, innocent heart
No, it's not wrong, but it's not right
Innocent time, out on his own
Not gonna do that, fuck, I'm out of control
I was just bored, playin' the guitar
Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard

It's the last one now, I can promise you that
I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back

Gone now are the old times
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us
Old friends, long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom of
The ocean now has swallowed
The only thing that's left is us
So pardon the silence that you're hearing
It's turnin' into a deafening, painful, shameful roar
 
He seemed impressed by the way you came in
"Tell us a story, I know you're not boring"
I was afraid that you would not insist
"You sound so sleepy, just take this, now leave me"

I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town

Yeah, the night's not over, you're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes, you ran me off the road
The wait is over, I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing, I'm not drowning fast enough

Now every time that I look at myself
"I thought I told you, this world is not for you"
The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
"You sound so angry, just calm down, you found me"

I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town

Yeah, the night's not over, you're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes, you ran me off the road
The wait is over, I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing, I'm not drowning fast enough
 
I sing a song, I paint a picture
My baby's gone, but I don't miss her
Like a swan, I don't miss swimming
All my friends left, and they don't miss me

Can't take it, babe
Your body talks to me
Like in a movie, babe
I let it resonate, yeah

I want your time (Time, time)
Don't ask me questions (Questions, questions)
That you don't want (Want, want)
The answers to (To, to)

I love you and I'm honest, so you know it's no lie
You're hidin' in the background but you wanna be found
You've got me on my back and now I've gotta think fast
You're hidin' in the background but you wanna be found

I take it easy, babe, I
I get down, it's automatic, uh
I've come to believin' that
That too much time is evil

I transition in
I'm making your body wait
Like on an aeroplane
Please, baby, take me away, yeah

I want your time (Time, time)
Don't ask me questions (Questions, questions)
That you don't want (Want, want)
The answers to (To, to)

I know
I know
I know
I know

I kinda miss the nine-to-five, yeah
Do those things that you can't hide
I scramble, fight just like a child
Hey, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
I'm staying hungry, I'm staying hungry
I'm staying hungry, I'm staying hungry
Not getting angry, I'm staying hungry
Not getting angry, staying, staying hungry
Yeah

Hold on, hold on, hold
The click was always in you Fab
It was never on
It was never on
 
Can the dark side light my way out? Yeah, yeah
Lay your hand across my face, yeah, yeah
Time we lost, that's all my fault

Please don’t be long, 'cause I want you now
I don't have love without you around
Life is too short, but I will live for you

How did this fit in your story? Yeah-eah
Why’d you let them judge your body? Yeah-eah
I'll be waitin' there outside, yeah

Please don't be long, 'cause I want your all
I don't have fun without your love
Life is too short, but I will live for you
You're mucking off, but I will live for you, my selfless love

Bite my tongue, I wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned
I turn and face the enemy
I'm not scared, just don’t care
I’m not listening, you hear?
He's never there, but I don’t care
I can't tell you what and where

Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
 
I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it out of this in time
I guess that's just fine
I'm not there quite yet
My thoughts, such a mess
Like a little boy
What you runnin' for?

Run at the door
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?

Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
You begged me not to go
Sinkin' like a stone
Use me like an oar
And get yourself to shore

A bang at the door
Anyone home?
That's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slammin' through your wall
In their face, I saw
What they're fightin' for

I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it 'til the end, I guess

Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
Bangin' on the door
I don't wanna know
Sinkin' like a stone
So use me like an oar

Hard to fight what I can't see
Not tryna build no dynasty
I can't see beyond this wall
But we lost this game
So many times before


Lying on the cold floor
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
Lying on the cold floor
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
 
Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door
Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

And say, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah


Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah
 
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
But like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make any sense
These strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?

I should have worked much harder
I should have just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
And something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work and you'll be on time
These little problems, they're not yours, they're mine
Come on, listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay

I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, you're a freak"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I

Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
And like my sister, don't give a fuck
I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it just don't make any sense
Oh, strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?

I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing

And all together, it went well
We made pretend, we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, I can wait"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
But for the record, it's between you and I
 
Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted
When they lied, I knew it was just stable
Children trying hard not to realize
I was sitting right behind you

Dear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me
We're not enemies, we just disagree
If I was like him, all pissed in this bar
He changes his mind, says I went too far
We all disagree, I think we should disagree, yeah

Is this it?
Is this it?
Is this it?

Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying there just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
 
Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Start to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending

Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving


I feel so different now, we trained at A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go, woo!
Darling, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so this is why I'm leaving
 
Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone, tried to take control
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame, says we're all the same
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right, it's true

He said he can't decide
I shake my head to say, "everything's just great"
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember

Raised in Carolina
She says, "I'm not like that"
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I say the right thing but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I'm watching TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
Oh man, can't you see, I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice so I can be mean
I missed the last bus, we'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
 
Close the door
Not all the way
He don’t understand
We don’t understand
So don’t you wanna remind me
I don’t know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I’ve waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watching you

You got it down now, don’t you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don’t you wanna remind me
I don’t know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I’ve waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watchin' you
I needed someone
I needed someone
 
One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break
Don't say it's in the bottle of air)

And first, he would tell me I'm his friend
Actually, no thanks, I'm okay
And then he would send weird looks my way

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They're making plans while I watch TV
Thought it was you, but maybe it's me
I want new friends, but they don't want me

And the '80s song, yeah, how did it go?
When they said, "This is the beginning of the best years"
Even though, false, break

One shot is never enough
I just wait for this to go into circles
And the distance from my room, is anything so necessary?
I was thinking about that thing that you said last night, so boring

And the '80s bands? Oh, where did they go?
Can we switch into the chorus right now?

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They have some fun, but then they just leave
Is it just them? Or maybe all me?
Why my new friends don't seem to want me

Hurts my case, but that's okay
It hurts my case, but that's okay
We're dancing on a moonbeam
On and on and on and on and on

The deeper I get, the less that I know
That's the way that it go
The less that I know, the deeper I go
Juliet, I adore
The deeper I get, the less that I know
Diminishing returns, oh

Oh, that's how it goes
All I wanna say
On another song
On another day
On another song
On another day
On another song
On another break
 
Dropped down the lights, I’m sitting with you
Moscow, 1972
Always singin' in my sleep
I will leave it in my dreams

Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Making bad decisions for you
Yeah, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
Makin' bad decisions for you

Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone

Oh baby, I hang on everything you say
I wanna write down every word
But do me a favor when you come through
When I look around, don't wanna see you
I don't take advice from fools
Never listenin' to you

Oh, makin' bad decisions
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Making bad decisions with you
Oh, makin' bad decisions
Uh-oh, makin' bad decisions
I'm makin' bad decisions with you

Pick up your gun
Put up those gloves
Save us from harm
Safe or alone

You, you didn't listen to me
But I, I didn't listen to you
I waited so long listening for
Something to join

I'm makin' bad decisions
Really, really bad decisions
I'm makin' bad decisions
On you, on you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm not gonna give a lot of credit
I don't know how to use, how
'Cause I can't, I can't
I can't, can't make anymore
 
If we don't watch the sun
It will rise
If we don't take our time
It's not wise
Putting posters up
For your band (Hey, we're playing a gig tonight if you wanna come by)
Now I'll tear them down
With my hand
I didn't want to notice
Didn't know the gun was loaded
Didn't really know this
What kind of asshole drives a Lotus?
Come here and go get with me
I wanna see you Wednesday
Come on, come on, come over
Take it off your shoulder
Come on and pull me over
We gotta get to work now
Sliding it off your shoulder
As we're falling over
Oh, welcome to Japan!
Scuba-dancing!
Touchdown!
I didn't want to notice
Didn't know the gun was loaded
Didn't really know this
What kind of asshole drives a Lotus?
I didn't want to bore you
Didn't wanna pick up your shit for ya
I've been ready to do this
I'll be there
Come here and go get with me
I wanna see you Wednesday
Come on, come on, come over
Take it off your shoulder
Come on and pull me over
We gotta get to work now
Sliding it off your shoulder
As we're falling over
You did it alone
You did it for fun
You did it for everyone who's on the run
You're not just a friend
You're me born again
We'll be in this race until the very end
He lives on the phone
He cheats on his clone
You'll never believe me 'til you're on your own
Comes in once a month
And he never leaves
He said he is broken
Yet he lives free
Didn't wanna floor ya
I didn't wanna be there for ya
Didn't wanna warn ya
I'll be there
 
Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racing against sunbeams
Losing against fig trees
In your eyes

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See, I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes

Let's go

When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there," he says
Then he walks out
Somehow he was trying
Too hard to be like them

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling let me go

Tried it once and they liked it
And tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doing this twenty-five years"
Well, I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah, oh, but that's it
 
Okay, I see how it is now
You don't have time to play with me anymore
That’s how it goes, I guess
Fuck the rest
Be right there, honey!

I’m gonna take my time to say
Take my time today
I’m gonna take what comes my way
Take what they give me
Yeah, I want my money now
But he is not around
You better hold my money safe
What's your emergency?

And for the first time in my life
I’m gonna get myself right
Just get into trouble
Be there on the double

Place your bets this time
Just has to let it ride
I tr- I tried to take a roll
But the dice are on parole
I won't look down your dress
I bet you bend down as a test
I cannot wait to chase it all
Yeah, I saw it in my crystal ball

Friday night is shining like
A secret for a spy
I got a better idea
I'll bet you on the side
When I get up in your face
You know it’s no surprise
Ah baby, why's it so hard to read the sentence in my eyes?

And for the first time
Chains on your legs
I spent a while
Then decided on you
My baby doll
You ignored your life
We’ll do it together
I’ll be there whenever

Oh, you took a minute break
And said, "thumbs up, they’re okay."
I’m going to watch the tidal wave
It’s hard to chase away

Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
(Got to chase away)
(Hard to chase away)
(It’s hard to chase away)
 
Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling, "No more!"
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you
 
This, and I never let it happen
Hey, yeah, oh
Hey, yeah, oh

When I think of you
It's always on my mind
Is that story true?
No one saves the day (Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't you want the truth?
Ignore reality
See, I love that feeling too
Nobody's gonna stop right now (Hey, yeah, oh)

Summer is coming, won't go away
Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)

I can't believe it
This is the eleventh hour
Psychedelic
Life is such a funny journey
Hercules, your service is no longer needed
It's just like make-believe (Hey, yeah, oh)

They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
Yeah, they got the remedy
But they won't let it happen (Hey, yeah, oh)
(Hey, yeah, oh)

Now that you heard the truth
All I need a friendly face
I hate that feeling too
But no one's unafraid (Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't expect the truth
This is a fantasy
I fight that feeling too
But nobody's gonna stop us now (Hey, yeah, oh)

Summer is coming, won't go away
Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)
Lo and behold the salt of the city
Pillars like time are fading away
Symphony building up to a future
Mystery to solve for somebody else (Hey, yeah, oh)

I can't believe it
Life is such a funny journey
Psychedelic
This is the eleventh hour
Hercules, your service is no longer needed
It's just like make-believe

They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
Yeah, they got the remedy
But they won't let it happen

Everybody's on the take
Tell me, are you on the take too?
Everybody's on the take
Tell me, are you on the take too?
(Hey, yeah, oh)
(Hey, yeah, oh)
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)
