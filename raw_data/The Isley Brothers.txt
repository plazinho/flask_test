Here is a story about a man comin' in and
Finding his woman in bed with
Well, listen

It's 2 A.M., I'm just getting in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her had she seen my baby
(Oh I) Drove my six around, looking for that missing lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused

And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa)
Hm, something's going on upstairs, yeah
Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming out

"You're contagious, touch me baby
Give me what you got" (Then a man said)
"Sexy lady (Ooh) drive me crazy
Drive me wild" (All I heard was my baby's voice screaming)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (Touch me)
Give me what you got" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
"Sexy lady (Then I heard another man) drive me crazy (Yeah)
Drive me wild" (And I just can't believe this shit, aw yeah)

I ran downstairs, looked in the closet, looking for that, ooh
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplating, "Not in my own damn house"
Who would have thought she was creeping with another man?
(Oh I) The down-low happening to me all over again

And then I turned the TV down (TV down, yeah)
Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Something going on up there upstairs
Cause I know that no one else lives here (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
Then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screamin'

"You're contagious (Whoa) touch me baby (Oh)
Give me what you got" (Then a man said)
"Sexy lady (Oh I) drive me crazy (Oh I)
Drive me wild" (All I can do was hear them say)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (Ooh)
Give me what you got" (Whoa)
"Sexy lady, drive me crazy
Drive me wild" (Oh, I can't believe this shit, bump bump bump)

What the hell is going on between the sheets in my home?
Baby wait, let me explain before you start to point your cane
Girl I'm 'bout to have a fit (Oh it's about to be some shit)
How did I get in to this? Shoulda never came home with this bitch
You low down dirty woman, back to where you come from
(But baby, wait) "But wait" my ass, hit the streets, your ass is grass!
(Now Mr. Biggs, before you done) Wait, how you know my name son?
(Honey wait, I was gonna tell you) Move, this cat looks real familiar
Hmm, now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago?
No, no, I don't think so
Yeah, yeah, I feel I know you brother very well
No, no, you're mistaking me for somebody else
(Frank!) Shut up! Can't you see two men are talking?
(But) Thought I told your ass to get to walking!
Now I think y'all better leave this place
Cause I'm about to catch a case

"You're contagious, touch me baby
Give me what you got" (Whoa, that's was she said)
"Sexy lady (Ooh) drive me crazy (Whoa)
Drive me wild" (And then he replied)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (Touch me)
Give me what you got" (Give me what you got)
"Sexy lady (Whoa) drive me crazy (Whoa)
Drive me wild" (Aw yeah, oh)
"You're contagious, touch me baby (I should've known from the shopping spree)
Give me what you got" (That's the only time you smiled at me)
"Sexy lady, drive me crazy (And making love girl, it wasn't the same)
Drive me wild" (I could tell how you say my name)
 
....Yeah...Bring your ass on in here
..I got something for you...

Busted, It's 2 o' damn clock in the morning, where you been?
(Baby didn't you get my 2-way

And they were both at home

Well they're the only friends I know
Girl you better
(Wait before you get all upset here's the truth)
Talk to me
(I was with my girl when she got some bad news)
And...?
(Her man cheated, had her upset and confused)
But baby what's that got to do
With you coming in at 2?
(I'm telling you, now she was so upset
She asked me to stay with her)
Well why didn't your ass just pick up the phone and call me?
(I was gonna do that but it slipped my mind I'm sorry)
(But I'm telling you the truth)
Yeah, well I got something for you...
Tell me what's her name? (Sharon)
Where does she live? (Uuummm...)
Her man's name? (Billy)
She got kids? (I think one or two)
She got kids? (Baby yes, no)
That's one thing I got to know
How the hell is she your friend
If you don't know if she got kids?

Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn
 
Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

I, I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

Honey, now let's stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin', try to be more aware

I, I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

Yeah, let's stop walkin' around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh, honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

Oh, honey, let's stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey, baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?
 
Ah-ha-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
Ah-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind
No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shinin' through the window
Lets me know every-everything's all right

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there
Not a care in the world
See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Through cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

Ah, summer breeze
 
Hey girl, ain't no mystery
At least as far as I can see
I want to keep you here
Laying next to me
Sharing our love between the sheets

Making love between the sheets

Soft and long, well, ooh

Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

I wanna be living for the love of you

Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well

Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
When you're lovin' me

When you're lovin' me, ooh

Love to be
Ridin' the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch and
It seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
You got me, girl

Alright now

Well, and this I see

Now and then I lose my way

Using words that try to say
What I feel (Ooh, ooh, ooh), yeah

Love is real
Oh, love is real, ooh

I might as well
Sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

I know that I'm living for the love of you
Oh, yes, I am
I know that I'm living for the love, love of you
Every, every day, I'm, living, for, the love of you

Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
No, no, no, no

Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
(Make believe, no need to make believe)
Look beyond your world, try to find a place for me
(Try and find, find a place for me)

'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
And if you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know, let me know
Let me know, oh
Love
Oh, baby
Stay at your best, baby, yeah
Please do it for my sake, sweet lady
 
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you who to sock it to
Alright
Aw, have mercy

Ah, it's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to, hit me man
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love girl, to whoever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now

It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you who to sock it to

Let me hear ya say, "It's my thing (it's my thing)
I do what I want to do."
I can't tell you
 
Ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do (Yes, I do)

These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

Always with half a kiss, you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start grinnin'
'Cause my head starts spinnin'

'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

Ooh, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it

'Cause I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you (Darling, I'm)
I love you (Weak for you)
This old heart (Darling, I'm), darling, is weak for you (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), yes, I do (Mad about you)
(Darling, I'm) I love you (Weak for you)
Yes, I do (Darling, I'm), darling (Mad about you)
 
All babies together, everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed
When will there be a harvest for the world
A nation planted, so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain
And far too many feelin' the strain
When will there be a harvest for the world
Gather every man, gather every woman
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
Gather everyone, gather all together
Overlooking none, hopin' life gets better for the world
Dress me up for battle, when all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price, come home with the least
Nation after nation, turning into beast
When will there be a harvest for the world?
When will there be?
I wanna know now, now
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be?
When will there be?
Everybody, talking bout the children
When will there be, a harvest?
When will there be?
 
Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see

Hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, girl
Hello, hello, oh
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, ooh

Hello, it's me, it's me, baby
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something's here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
I can't help it, baby
Seeing you, yeah, seeing anyone as much as I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through, baby
You know why, ah yeah

It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe

(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
But one thing I want you to do is

Think of me, think of me, baby
You know I'd be with you if I could
Come around and see you once in a while
If you ever need a reason to smile
I'd spend the night if you think I should
Well

It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change

Don't change, baby
Oh, keep everything the same, baby
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
Girl, don't you move too far, girl
I'll come around, come around and see you every once in a while
If you ever need, ah, if you ever need a reason to smile, baby

Just don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Ah, oh
(Don't change, don't change)
Keep everything the same, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Think about me, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep your mind
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep your mind
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Don't change, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, don't change
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Keep every, everything the same
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Sweet as you are
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Well, well, well, well, well
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
 
Choosey lover
Girl, I'm so proud of you
I'm so glad you chose me, baby, baby
And I'll make you so happy

Thought I had a lover, thought I had a lover
But I was kiddin' myself, baby

Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we've got to fight the powers that be
Got so many voices, saying all the same, yeah
Killing up all around me, faces full of pain

I tried to play my music, they say my music’s too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, hey

Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we got to fight the powers that be
I don’t understand it, people wanna say yeah
Those that got the answers, red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy, let’s just have some fun now, now
Seekin’ my satisfaction, keeps me on the run


Time is truly wastin’, there’s no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin’, we got to fight the powers that be
Fight it baby, yeah, woo, hey, even you and I can fight the power
Fight it, fight the power (repeat to end)
 
Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Lovely lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

Hear me callin' out to you
Cause it's all that I can do
Your eyes tell me to pursue
But you say look yeah but don't touch, baby
Nah, nah, nah don't touch

Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Sexy lady, who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

I would dance upon a string
Any gift she'd want I'd bring
I would give her anything
If she would just do what I say
Come 'round my way baby, shine my way

Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Lovely lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

I would love to take her home
But her heart is made of stone
Gotta keep on keepin' on
If I don't she'll do me wrong
Do me wrong, yeah
 
Can't you see the soldiers

Machine guns, bullets flying
Children run, mothers screaming (Father, forgive them)
Machine guns (for they know not)
Bullets flying (what they do)
Machine gun, bullets flying (blessed are)
Children scream (the pure in heart)

Mothers mourn (blessed are, the meek)
(For they) Machine gun (shall inherit the Earth)
Carry my body (Lord, have mercy, forgive them), machine gun
(For they know not, what they do) Carry my body
(Forgive them, they know not what they do)
Jimi Hendrix would say
Machine gun, don't you shoot me
Don't you shoot me, don't you shoot me
Don't you shoot me, don't you shoot me
