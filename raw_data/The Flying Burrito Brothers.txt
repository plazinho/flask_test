This old town is filled with sin
It will swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away
You've got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

The scientists say
It'll all wash away
But we don't believe any more
'Cause we've got our recruits
And our green mohair suits
So please show your I.D. at the door

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

A friend came around
Tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
But he trusted his crowd
So he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You may be sweet and nice
But that won't keep you warm at night
'Cause I'm the one who showed you how
To do the things you're doing now

He may feel all your charms
He may hold you in his arms
But I'm the one who let you in
I was right beside you then

Once upon a time
You let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew, nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried?

I'm your toy, I'm your old boy
But I don't want no one but you to love me
No, I wouldn't lie
You know I'm not that kind of guy

Once upon a time
You let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew, nobody saw
Do you remember the way you cried?
I'm your toy, I'm your old boy
But I don't want no one but you to love me
No, I wouldn't lie
You know I'm not that kind of guyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Now, a woman like that, all she does is hate you
She doesn't know what makes a man a man
She'll talk about the time that she's been with you
She'll speak your name to everyone she can
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can't do without
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
It's all right to call her, but I'll bet you
The moon is full and you're just wasting time
She's a devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's a devil in disguise, in disguise
In disguise, in disguise
In disguise, in disguise
In disguise1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hey Colorado, it was not so long ago
I left your mountains to try life on the road
Now I'm finished with that race
It was much too fast a pace
And I think I know my place
Colorado, I wanna come home

There was a woman but I left her far behind
I could have loved her if I'd only had the time
Oh, but I stopped along my way
Just long enough to say
Lord I'd really, really like to stay
But my lady knows I've got to go

I was too young to know what I'd done
I made my plans but I was wrong, yes, I was wrong

Hey Colorado, is it too late to change my mind?
I've done some thinking and I'm trying hard to find
The way to come back home
Lord, I've been so very long alone
Won't you take care of your own?
Colorado, I think I'm coming home
I wanna come home
Won't you let me come home?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
A letter came today from the draft board
With trembling hands I read the questionnaire
It asked me questions about my mama and papa
Now that ain't what I call exactly fair

So I'm heading for the nearest foreign border
Vancouver might be just my kind of town
Cause they don't need the kind of law and order
That tends to keep a good man underground

A sad old soldier once told me a story
About a battlefield that he was on
He said a man should never fight for glory
He must know what is right and what is wrong


Now, I don't know how much I owe my uncle
But I suspect it's more than I can pay
He's asking me to sign a three-year contract
I guess I'll catch the first bus out today

Yes, you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you but that's the way that it goes
So it goes, yes, you know how I feel
So it goes, it just couldn't be real
And we know it's wrong
And I don't think it's gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
I've been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you don't want another fight
But you better love, find some love
You better love me, Jesus Christ
Yes, you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you, baby, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes, I guess you know how I feel
So it goes, yes, it couldn't be real
And you want me home all night
You just don't want another fight
But you better love, find some love
Love me baby, Jesus ChristEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was walking down the street the other day
And a sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy, I must have been twice his size
His appearence typified his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my early trips to town
As he walked beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell
So we walked together that way through this neighborhood
Finally he turned around to me
And he said friend, you know we're a million miles apart
But you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
So why don't we put our differences aside
And just talk to each other
You see this box beneath my arm
To you it's plain, it has no charm
But to someone dearest to my heart this box has played a tragic part
This little one can't tell you himself about his life and how he died
But if anyone else could speak for him I guess I'm qualified
This boy was in Chicago, he didn't know why he was there
He was with his family and friends and he didn't really care
You might have been one of those
Who saw the struggle there on your television screen
The tragic thing is so much else happened
That no one else could have seen
A stranger handed this boy a dollar to do a simple chore
To carry a package to a nearby hotel
And when he returned he'd get two more
But when he came back he sort of lost his way walking thru the crowd
One of them things you ask yourself, how the Lord allowed
But when he was found he was like he is now
Dreaming sweet and still
And in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
Now you can take that dollar
Get four cents on it compound it quarterly at any downtown bank
So they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb
Well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave
You kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing
It's the same for any hippie, bum or hillbilly out on the street
Just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat
Now could you help us sing this song, please
There will be peace in the valley for him now we pray
I will think of the little hippie boy that wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
At the dark end of the street
That's where we'll always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me
I know that time's gonna take its toll
We'll have to pay for the love that we stole
'Cause it's a sin and we know that we're wrong
Oh, but our love keeps coming on strong
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me
They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We'll steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me
If you take a walk downtown
And find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by
Oh, darling, please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
You and me
You and me
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
You and me (you and me)
(You and me)

No affection were the words that stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me for the very last time
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
I don't know what I've done to be treated this way
In a cold dirty room, that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
I don't know what I've done and I'm feeling so ashamed
Then an angel appeared, she was just seventeen
In a dirty old gown with a conscious so clean
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
She's brought back the life that I once threw away
She's brought back the life that I once threw awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We've all got wheels to take ourselves away
We've got the telephones to say what we can't say
We've all got higher and higher every day
Come on wheels, take this boy away

We're not afraid to ride
We're not afraid to die
So come on wheels, take me home today
Come on wheels, take this boy away


And when I feel my time is almost up
And destiny is in my right hand
I'll turn to him who made my faith so strong
Come on wheels, make this boy a man

We're not afraid to ride
We're not afraid to die
Come on wheels, take me home today
Come on wheels, take this boy away
Come on wheels, take this boy awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody else could make me do wrong
Take me for granted and I'll tag along
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong
A woman's only human
This you must understand
She's not just a plaything
She expects love just like a man
So, if you want a do right all day woman
You got to be a do right all night man
They say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
So as long as we're together, baby
You better show some respect for me
So, if you want a do right all day woman
You got to be a do right all night man
You got to be a do right all night man
You got to be a do right all night manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Do you know how it feels to be lonesome?
When there's just no one left who really cares
Did you ever try to smile at some people?
And all they ever seem to do is stare

And you remember how it feels to be cold again
When the happiness of love has gone away
And you never want to go out on the street again
And you only seem to live from day to day

Do you know how it feels to be lonesome?
When there's just no one left who really cares
Did you ever try to smile at some people?
Yes and all they ever seem to do is stare
Yes and all they ever seem to do is stareEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or off stage lights
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
I know I've dreamed you, a sin and a lie
I had my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Tempted and tried we're often made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, come sing in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, come sing in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master
A few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing
When we sweep through that beautiful gate
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, come sing in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
We'll understand it all by and byEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't ever think about tomorrow
Whether or why is all on another day
And I think that it's been said by somebody up ahead
The older guys tell me what it's all about
The older guys really got it all worked out
Since we got the older guys to show us how
I don't see why we can't stop right now
It's so cold staying living down on the ocean
Dead on the beach is where I want to rent my home
And I think that it's been said by somebody up ahead
The older guys get the ladies with their style
Yeah the older guys squeeze 'em till it makes them smile
What's the sense of looking like a cop on the beat ?
What's the sense of looking like a girl on the street ?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's a lazy day, I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day, I got a thing that I want to try with you
Now baby, don't go away, please don't spoil my lazy day
Isn't it better, didn't you know ? Just sitting down here by my radio
I'm gonna make you worry none about your income tax
No there's no need to hurry I gotta teach you how to relax
It's a lazy day, I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day, I got a thing that I want to try with you
Now baby, don't you go away, please don't spoil my lazy day
No you don't have to think about nothing to do
'Cause when I get you down to my barbacue
I'm gonna make you feel funny and sparkle like a brand new dime
No I don't have any money but I always got plenty of time
It's a lazy day, I'm down with nothing else to do
It's a crazy day, I got a thing that I want to try with you
Now baby, don't you go away, please don't spoil my lazy day
It's a lazy day
It's a lazy day

Roberts-Hillman
You know I lost a friend the other day
She said she'd like to stay, but she's on her way
And I can't believe that she's leaving me
And it's been so long goin' on
Just can't be
Well it's happened before, well I never dreamed
It could happen with her, all the same old scenes
And it can't be true what's she trying to do
Be The death of me can't you see
Just can't be
What went wrong, well you know
I don't understand
But it's done and you know
I've done all I can
So I'll say goodbye to these tears I've cried
I will carry on, get along
I won't ask why
So I'll say goodbye to these tears I've cried
I will carry on, get along
I won't ask whyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
There's a place everyone of us can go to
Maybe you have been there once or twice
Where all your friends just look at you and whisper
And they want to give you nothing but advice
When you walk in they all know what you're after
And the higher that you get the more they'll see
In a dark room filled with music, wine and laughter
Your eyes keep searching for her constantly
Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears ?
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer ?
Every night it's the same sad old procedure
The doorman winks at you on your way out
'Cause deep inside he knows ………. turnin'
And he's got something you can't live without
There's nothing new that can be said about dirt
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt
Of an old love's fancy life has left you stranded in a dream
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen ?
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen ?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Cody, Cody I hear you say
I hear your voice calling me away
I'm not afraid to think of what I might find
I will be yours, will you be mine
We've all been young, we've all been old
We've all been sheltered from the cold
Come to my side and say what I think
I already know
I'm going away don't you want to go
Solo
I remember the face that Harvey drew
It was of a man
That my eyes saw thru
Come by my side before the evening is gone
And see where else this body's flownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Drivin' in my car down to the corner bar
I'm gonna get real drunk and crazy before I'm through
And when I've had my fill and you know I will
Baby, then I can get my message home to you
Can't you hear me calling?
Can't you hear me calling?
Oh, it seems as though I've wasted too much time
Can't you hear me calling?
Can't you hear me calling?
Lord, I'm about to lose my mind
I pulled back into town before the sun went down
I spent twenty four hours behind the old jail door
And the judge said, "Son, I know you've had your fun
But I better not catch you havin' anymore"
Can't you hear me calling?
Can't you feel me falling?
Oh, things that I've gone through to make you mine
Can't you hear me calling?
Can't you feel me falling?
Lord, I'm about to lose my mind
Oh Lord, I'm about to lose my mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
