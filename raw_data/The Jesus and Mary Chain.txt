Listen to the girl as she takes on half the world
Moving up and so alive in her honey dripping beehive, beehive
It's good, so good
It's so good, so good

Walking back to you is the hardest thing that I can do
That I can do for you, for you

I'll be your plastic toy
I'll be your plastic toy, for you

Eating up the scum is the hardest thing for me to do

Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey, just like honey
Just like honey
 
Hey, honey, what you trying to say?
As I stand here, don't you walk away
And the world comes tumbling down
Hand in hand in a violent life
Making love on the edge of a knife
And the world comes tumbling down

And it's hard for me to say
And it's hard for me to stay
I'm going down to be by myself
I'm going back for the good of my health
And there's one thing I couldn't do
Sacrifice myself to you
Sacrifice

Baby, baby, I just can't see
Just what you mean to me
I take my aim and I fake my words
I'm just your longtime curse
And if you walk away
I can't take it

But that's the way that you are
And that's the things that you say
But now you've gone too far
With all the things you say
Get back to where you come from
I can't help it, under the April skies
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies

Under the April sun
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies

The sun grows cold, the sky gets black
And you broke me up and now you won't come back
Shaking hand, life is dead
And a broken heart and a screaming head
Hey, hey

Under the April skies
Under the April sun
Under the April skies
Under the April skies
 
Step back and watch the sweet thing
Breaking everything she sees
She can take my darkest feeling
Tear it up till I'm on me knees
Plug into her electric cool
Where things bend and break and shake to the rule
Talking fast couldn't tell me something
I would shed my skin for you
Talking fast on the edge of nothing
I would break my back for you
Don't know why, don't know why
Things vaporise and rise to the sky

And we tried so hard
And we looked so good
And we lived our lives in black
But something about you felt like pain
You were my sunny day rain
You were the clouds in the sky
You were the darkest sky
But your lips spoke gold and honey
And that's why I'm happy when it rains
I'm happy when it pours

Look at me enjoying something
That feels like, feels like pain
To my brain

And if I tell you something
You take me back to nothing
I'm on the edge of something
You take me back

And I'm happy when it rains
And I'm happy when it rains
And I'm happy now
And I'm happy when it rains

And I'm happy now
And I'm happy when it rains
And I'm happy now
Oh, I'm happy now
Oh, I'm happy when it rains
 
As soon as I get my head 'round you
I come around catching sparks off you
I get an electric charge from you
That secondhand living, it just won't do

And the way I feel tonight
Oh, I could die and I wouldn't mind
And there's something going on inside

Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground

As soon as I get my head 'round you
I come around catching sparks off you
And all I ever got from you
Was all I ever took from you

And the world could die in pain
And I wouldn't feel no shame
And there's nothing holding me to blame

Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
And I'm taking myself to the dirty part of town
Where all my troubles can't be found


Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground

Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground

I said head
Ohw, head
Eah, head
Ohw, head

Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Ohw, head
Ohw, head
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ahh yeah, yeah, yeah...
 
I never thought that this day would ever come
When your words and your touch just struck me numb
Oh, and it's plain to see that it's dead
The thing swims in blood and it's cold, stony dead
It's so hard not to feel ashamed
Of the loving, living games we play each day
And I'm stuck in a shack down the back of the sea
Oh, and I'm alive and I'm alone inside a sick, sick dream
Oh, is it me, is it me that feels so weak?
I cannot deceive but I find it hard to speak
The hardest walk you could ever take
Is the walk you take from A to B to C
I walk, oh honey, I talk
Don't want you to want me
Don't want you to need me
Don't want you to need me
Don't want you to need me
And I walk
 
I met a girl, she was crazy about me
And in a lifetime this happens once or twice, maybe
And who'd have thought that it would ever happen to me?
I met a girl, she was crazy about me
The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need the drugs, just the two of us
The two of us are getting high
I met a boy, he was crazy about me
And all my friends say he is the other half of me
And everybody says we are so young and free
I met a boy, he was crazy about me
The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need the drugs, just the two of us
The two of us are getting high
Well, I was born the day that I met you
I couldn't leave you if I tried
In a thousand years, I couldn't forget you
'Cause you're the reason I'm alive
You're the reason I'm alive
You're the reason I'm alive
The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need drugs 'cause we know how to fly
The two of us are getting high
We don't need the drugs, just the two of us
The two of us are getting high
 
You ain't like those other girls
There's nothing like you in this world
You got something more than curls
You ain't like those other girls

You ain't like those other guys
There's something different in your eyes
You got something hard to find
You ain't like those other guys

I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always gonna be sad
'Cause you're the best I've ever had

A million miles between us now
Why can't we just work things out?

I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always sad
I think I'm always gonna be sad
'Cause you're the best I've ever had
 
I'm going to the darklands
To talk in rhyme
With my chaotic soul
As sure as life means nothing
And all things end in nothing
And heaven, I think
Is too close to hell

I wanna move
I wanna go
Oh, I wanna go
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do

Oh, something won't let me
Go to the place
Where the darklands are
And I awake from dreams
To a scary world of screams
And heaven, I think
Is too close to hell

I wanna move
I wanna go
Oh, I wanna go
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do

Take me to the dark
Oh god, I get down on my knees
And I feel like I could die
By the river of disease
And I feel that I'm dying
And I'm dying
I'm down on my knees
Oh, I'm down

I wanna go
I wanna stay
Oh, I wanna stay
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
 
Tryna win your interest back
But you ain't having none of that
Feel just like a ship in a bottle
Kiss today but fuck tomorrow
I don't know, I guess that we're all through

Fucked-up girls like drugged-up guys
That won't keep them warm at night
It's just like a grape in a bottle
It's wine today but piss tomorrow
I don't know, I guess that we're all through

I'm a rock and roll amputation
I'm a rock and roll amputation
I'm a rock and roll amputation
I'm a rock and roll amputation
Amputation
Amputation

Amputation
Amputation
Amputation
Amputation
 
Nine million rainy days
Have swept across my eyes thinking of you
And this room becomes a shrine thinking of you
And the way you are sends the shivers to my head
You're gonna fall, you're gonna fall down dead

As far as I can tell
I'm being dragged from here to hell
All my time in hell is spent with you

I have ached for you
I have nothing left to give for you to take
I have no more empty heart or limbs to break
And the way you are sends the shivers to my head
You're gonna fall, you're gonna fall down dead

As far as I can see
There is nothing left of me
All my time in hell was spent with you

Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna die
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
You're gonna fall
 
The sun comes up, another day begins
And I don't even worry about the state I'm in
My head's so heavy and I'm looking thin
But when the sun goes down I'm gonna start again
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

You're never understanding
You never understand me, yeah
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

Stop, turn around and take a look at me
Why don't you take a close look and tell me what you see
The things I say, you only disagree
You'll never understand, that's what I want to be
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

You're never understanding
You never understand me, yeah
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh
Uh-uh huh

Looking so hard but you just can't see me
I tell you the truth but you don't believe me
You're thinking out loud but can't hear what you're saying
Tomorrow I'm leaving 'cause I'm not staying, yeah
'Cause I'm not staying, yeah
'Cause I'm not staying, yeah
'Cause I'm not staying, yeah

Uh-uh huh
 
I...can see
That you...and me
Live our lives in the pouring rain
And the raindrops beat out of time to our refrain
And you...and me
Will win...you'll see
People die in their living rooms
But they do not need this God almighty gloom

There's something warm about the rain
There's something warm
There's something warm
There's something warm in everything
I know there's something good
There's something good
About you
About you
About you
I know there's something warm
There's something warm
There's something warm
Good about you
 
Crack of dawn
Cindy's moving on
Talking Cindy to everyone
Till she's had her fun
She and me
We twist the sun and sea
Still, she's talking to everyone
Cindy's had her fun
Though I've heard it before
Still, I need it more and more
But I just can't get away
Cindy kills me every day
And I tried and I tried but she looked right through me
Knife to my head when she talks so sweetly
Knife in my head when I think of Cindy
Knife in my head is the taste of Cindy
 
It's too cool
To get something done
Too many things move fast
I can't quite get a grip at last
And all the stars don't shine
And all the stars don't shine
And all the walls fall down
And all the fish get drowned

Here it comes
Can't you hear the sound of it
Just like a big brass drum
And some cunt's always scratching it
Just like a voice is pain
Just like the taste is pain
I wish that I could fly
You have to learn to fly


She's singing to herself
As she's singing in herself
And she walk right up to you
As she walk all over you

Don't turn off
I don't expect, I just accept
I'm happy in my box
You got to see the box upstairs
And the sun don't shine
And all the stars don't shine
And all the walls fall down
And all the fish get drowned

She's singing to herself
As she's singing in herself
And she walk right up to you
As she walk all over you
 
Sometimes
I walk sideways
To avoid you
When I've annoyed you
Love's like
The mighty ocean
When it's frozen
That is your heart
What would I be
If I could be free
I couldn't even walk
You trip me up
But you break me in two
And you throw me away
And you spit in my cup
You trip me up
And you break me in two
And you throw me away
Knock me on my back
I'll send a heart attack
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip
I'd like to trip
I'd like to trip you up
I'd like to trip you up
 
What can I do
It's gotten me beaten black and blue
Why don't you know
You got me moving much too slow
Why can't you see
You got me chasing honey bees
You made me fall
Broke me up and took it all
Call me your messed up boy
Just what I've found
You knock my body to the ground
Just what I've said
You're tearing up my weary head
Do I still shine
After such a lonely time
You cut me dead
You nail me down and kick my head
Cut dead your messed up boy
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
 
Deep one perfect morning
As the sun was heading up into the sky
And I'm sitting here warming
To the coldness of the things that meet my eye
Something in me's stirring
And the moon and all the stars fail to comply

And my thoughts are turning backwards
And I'm picking at the pieces
Of a world that keeps turning the screws
Into my mind

Something in me's chilling
And nothing in me's willing
To focus my attention on the sky
Past the weakened eyes that
Feel and scream into your soul
Better to paint my hate
On the walls before the picture goes

And my thoughts are turning backwards
And I'm picking at the pieces
Of a world that keeps turning the screws
Into my mind

And I can see a wide world
For me to tame
I can see a wide world
For me to tame
For me to tame
For me to tame
For me to tame
For me to tame
 
I'm going down to the place tonight
To see if I can get the taste tonight
A taste of something warm and sweet
That shivers your bones and rises to your heat
I'm going down to the place tonight
The damp and hungry place tonight
Should all the stars shine in the sky
They couldn't outshine your sparkling eyes
But it's so hard to be the one
To touch and tease and to do it all for fun
But it's too much for a young heart to take
Cause hearts are the easiest things you could break
And I talk to the filth, and I walk through the door
I'm knee deep in myself, but I want to get more of that stuff
Of that stuff
Some candy talking
Some candy talking
Talk
And I want, and I want
Some candy talking (x 4)
Some candy talk (x 4)
I love the way she's walking
I love the way she's talking
It's just the way she's walking
It's just the way she's talking
And I need all that stuff
Give me some of that stuff
I want you, candy, I want you, candy
And I need, give me some of your stuff
Give me some
I want your candy. I want your candy
I want your candy. I want your candy
I want stuff
 
I gave you all I had
I gave you good and bad
I gave but you just threw it back

I won't get on my knees
Don't make me do that please
I've been away but now I'm back

Don't be too sure of that
What makes you sure of that
You went away you can't come back

I walked away from you
I hurt you through and through
Aw honey give me one more chance

Aw you're a lucky son
Lucky son of a gun
You went away, you went away
You went away but now you're back

I got down on my knees
And then I begged you please
I always knew you'd take me back
 
The wind is screaming around the trees for my Psychocandy
The world is spreading a strange disease for my
Psychocandy
Candy is the baddest seed
She'll take you down and make you eat
Her fish
Her poison fish
Is on her dish
Candy cannot hear or see
She's in the place she needs to be
She'll take the point to a sharpened blade
And give you something warm to taste
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(Psychocandy)
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(Psychocandy)
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(Psychocandy)
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(She's my Psychocandy)
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(She's my Psychocandy)
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(Psychocandy)
And the world is turning 'round
And on and on and on
(Psycho)
