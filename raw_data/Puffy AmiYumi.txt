When there's trouble, you know who to call (Teen Titans!)
From their tower, they can see it all (Teen Titans!)
When there's evil on the attack
You can rest knowing they got your back
'Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol
Teen Titans, go!

With their superpowers, they unite (Teen Titans!)
Never met a villain that they liked (Teen Titans!)
They've got the bad guys on the run
They never stop 'til the job gets done
'Cause when the world is losing all control
Teen Titans, go!
Teen Titans, go!

If your heart is black, you better watch out
You cannot escape the team
When they catch you, there won't be any doubt
You've been beaten by the teens
Beaten by the teens
T-e-e-n! T-i-t-a-n-s! Teen Titans! Let's go!

Nagare nagare te kita mon da

Tadori tsuita koko wa ittai doko
Karada wa yake ni karu kunaru
Too kude minna tema neki shiteru
Hata mata koko wa tengoku ka chi no hate ka

So kawaii hito yo kocchi e kite o kure
Maa boku no hanashi o kikanai ka
Mata kawaii hito ga waraatte kureru nara
Saa itte miyo oka yume no kuni

Sakura mai chiru hana fubuki (ooh, hana fubuki)
Nokoe yama koe kaki wakete kite (wakete kite)
Yasashiku sarete sonoki ni natte
Tooi ano hi ni chuu ningu (chuu ningu)
Hatsukoi no ano koto kasa ne ruze ()
Amai kao ri ni yowasarete awa ni naru

So kawaii hito yo kocchi e kite o kure
Maa me utsuri shichau boku dakedo
Mata kawaii hito ga waraatte kureru nara
Saa itte miyo oka yume encho

Mata kawaii hito ga waraatte kureru nara

Just when I thought I had to make it alone
You were right there by my side
Making a stand holding my hand the way you do
There to remind me of a "me and you"
When I'm with you all my fear disappears
Like if I reach, I touch the sky
You've got my back, pick up my slack when I can't see
But nothing picks me up like knowing we'll be
Friends forever
Face whatever
Friends forever
Yay! we're never gonna be apart
You and me, we are so oddly the same
The way we think, the way we play
Right from the start, so off the charts, about this thing
But we didn't know at first that we were making
Friends forever
Bound together
Friends forever
Yeah! We'll always be there
Oh yes, there also can be times that get rough
And all that can be said is "sorry"
That we were wrong and said some meaningless stuff
And we'll go on together, through any nasty weather
Yeah
Friends forever
Bound together
Friends forever
Face whatever
 
The CD spins and we begin all systems go
Come hitch a ride inside and watch the moon grow
It won't be long before we're up in zero G
Above the atmosphere just you and me and me
Planet Tokyo is a place not very far
In your stereo it's as close as where you are
On the radio it's a sound that you can see
Planet Tokyo is the place you want to be
Tonight
Right
You're looking well but we can tell you need a fix
For something more than just another chick flick
A riff so strong that it belongs deep underground
A beat so sweet it makes you weep when we touch down on
Planet Tokyo is a place not very far
In your stereo it's as close as where you are
On the radio it's a sound that you can see
Planet Tokyo is the place you want to be
Tonight
Planet Tokyo is a place not very far
In your stereo it's as close as where you are
On the radio it's a sound that you can see
Planet Tokyo is the place you want to be
Tonight

Wait in a bundle, form a circle
Iran Afghan let us hear the balalaika
Bijin Ariran Gamelan lasagna
Be a mouse or move the cursor
Kibun eleven access, wanna try now?
Open the door the time is now
We are what's happening...Asia
Take every panda and line them all up
Every single white one
Tonight the pure hearts are shining so bright
About to burst into flame
And they glitter and they glow
Fire flowers in the sky

The heat is on when the night is falling
Tabun Hong Kong blinky whinky all night long
Open the door even if tears should start to fall
Even if there's a flood...Asia
Take all the stars and you see a big map
On the Yellow River
Somewhere a pure heart is waiting to meet
The other sweetest heartbeat
Breathing day into the night so tomorrow will be bright
Take every panda and line them all up
Every single white one
Now every pure heart is shining so bright
About to burst into flame
And they glitter and they glow
And we all will love them so
In the twinkling of our hearts
Now access love
 
In our new world, we'll draw a new map
Which way do we go? The path wasn't easy
Wasting time, falling behind
Between the waves kept us going
We know the way, been here before
When you're tired, remember what love was
Look ahead, , that's made to help you survive

The road that we walk today, we are the ones who  them to stay
And although no one ever packed their bags, we didn't mind, we push and pull
We took the fastest lane, keep following, you're good to go
Go on, pass us, it's your call
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo

Why keep trying, do as we want
It's too hard to say what's always 
All said and done, we've gone 
It seems the story is 

The road that we walk today, we are the ones  them to stay
You know that  and the tears we cried leads up to you
Go ahead, 
We took the fastest lane, keep following, you're good to go
Go on, pass us, it's your call

Rising , 
I see our hands waving
Rising 

We know the way, been here before
There was nothing, we found much more
A simple dream, I grabbed it tightly to me

The road that we walk today, we are the ones  them to stay
And now it's your turn to make the way, and then we'll come to follow you
Just like the waves you make, the road is wide so no one falls
Go on, pass us, it's your call
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
 
What the hell happened to me
I've become such a mess
I'm a walking disaster
On a road full of stress
You got all that you wanted
You got the good part of me
And I'm getting kind of dizzy
From this crazy disease
So get me a doctor
I need a repair
I'm pushing my limits
And pulling out my hair
And it's all because of you
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
You've got me spinning like a record
That's already worn out
And I'm kicking and I'm screaming
And repeating myself
I gotta hold myself together and not fall apart
If it's gonna be forever tell me where do I start
So send me a signal
Up in the air
You're pushing my buttons
I'm pulling out my hair
And it's all because of you
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because of you
I can't help it
Can't stop it
I know it's all your fault
But I like it and you love me
Yeah yeah yeah
It's all because of you
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because and it's all because of you
I just run into walls and trip over my shoes
I get up, I fall down, every time you come around
I'm not cool
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
 
She turned her night light on and blew him a kiss
He stared back with green crayola eyes
She traced his likeness from the back of her disc
Next to a promise of the biggest prize, oh!
She's joining a fan club, with her friends
Filling her bedroom with tee-shirts and 8 by 10's
He looks dreamy
She's in love from afar
When she's picking up her fallen star
Downstairs the late shows got the age of the rock
The monks on from last sunday at the milky way
Mom's writing checks to the priest on the church singing
Ding dong ding
Cause if you wanna get to heaven all you gotta do is pay to pray
She's joining a fan club, with her friends
Filling her bathtub with holy water and amens
He looks dreamy
She's in love from afar
When she's picking up her fallen star
She's joining a fan club with her friends
Filling her bedroom with tee-shirts and 8 by 10's
He looks dreamy
She's in love from afar
When she's picking up her fallen star
Picking up her fallen star
Shake, Shake that booty
Promise and pinochio
You make your money
Now watch that money grow
She's joining a fan club, with her friends
Filling her bedroom with tee-shirts and 8 by 10s
He looks dreamy
She's in love from afar
Cause she's picking up her fallen star
Joining a fan club
Big mistake
I still get heartburn
Thinking of the stamps I ate
Cause I loved him
Before fate crashed his car
See I'm praying for a falling star
I'm waiting for a falling star
Ah ah ah ah ah
 
Sorry that I'm such a mess
And I'm not wearing a pretty dress
I think I look pretty good to me
And sorry I haven't washed my hair
I'm sorry but maybe I don't care
Looking dirty's pretty cute to me
'Cause nothing's worth it, no one's perfect
Don't let anything get in the way
'Cause I don't wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the TV shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be anybody else but me
Sorry for saying what's on my mind
Instead of saying the proper lines
Holding back is impossible for me
Maybe we shouldn't try at all
Sometimes perfection is a flaw
It's really not my personality
'Cause nothing's worth it, no one's perfect
Don't let anything get in the way
I don't wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the TV shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be anybody else but me
What happened to keeping it real
Being honest with the way you feel
Speak your mind and try to be yourself
'Cause I don't wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the TV shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be, I don't really really wanna be
Anybody else but me
Don't wanna live the perfect life
You see in all the TV shows
The magazines and the videos
This is how my story goes
I don't wanna be anybody else but me

Well you're texting me on a Friday night
But I'm out with the girls, got my hair color right
So I just hit erase on my hot pink phone
But you just keep on sending 'em cause you're all alone
Don't call me if you listen to country
Don't call me if you listen to modern soul
Don't call me if you like that hip-hop no
But you can call me what you like if you like rock-and-roll
There's a hundred people trying to get in the club
But we walk by 'em 'cause we push and we shove
The music's so bad, we gotta slap the DJ
We take over the decks and everything is okay
Baby, don't you know that we don't roll like that
Baby, don't you know that we don't roll, roll, roll
Don't call me if you listen to country
Don't call me if you listen to modern soul
Don't call me if you like that hip-hop no

Ooh, ooh, we ain't no country girls
Ooh, ooh, we ain't no urban girls
Ooh, ooh, we ain't no harujuku girls
Ooh, ooh, we're just straight up rock-and-roll!
Don't call me if you listen to country
Don't call me if you listen to modern soul
Don't call me if you like that hip-hop no
But you can call me what you like if you like rock-and-roll
Don't call me if you listen to country
Don't call me if you listen to modern soul
Don't call me if you like that hip-hop no

パフィー「東京ナイツ」の歌詞
はじまりは新しい色
誘うポーズのフラミンゴ
キラキラ光るアーケードと甘栗
待ち合わせは中華の壁
ビルの谷間迷い込んだ
夜のムードで夜の歌が聞えてくる
歌う 東京ナイツ 甘く溶けて
東京ナイツ 夜に微笑む
口紅は新しい色
ダンスを踴るアナコンダ
リムジンのTVでながめたふるさと
パパイヤを手に持つ男
冷えたワインはクラシック
夜のムードで夜の歌が聞えてくる
歌う 東京ナイツ 甘く溶けて
東京ナイツ 夜に微笑む
東京ナイツ 甘く溶けて
東京ナイツ 夜に微笑む
月明かり 見慣れない雲
遠すぎる星
花を手に 泣いてる あの娘
白い歯がキラ リ
歌う 東京ナイツ 甘く溶けて
東京ナイツ 夜に微笑む

パフィー「赤いブランコ」の歌詞
赤いブランコふたり乗り 
漕げば大人になってくようで 
あの山もあの頃のまま
ただそばにいないだけ
朝が日々を照らして 
忙しく暮らしていても 
待ち過ぎて ずっと
待ち過ぎて 
帰ろうよ
あの日の場所で会いたい…
小さな頃に描いてた
夢の続きはもう見ない 
いつもふたりは笑ってた
忘れることがただ怖い
声も 言葉ひとつも
約束も 胸の痛みも
軽々と抱き上げる手も
見下ろした小さな町も
朝が日々を照らして
忙しいフリしていても
幾つもの時を越えても
寝ころんだ小さな部屋も
手触りも 好きだった花も
突然の白い子犬も
泣きぬれた夜 もう何度
この先もずっとずっと先も
会いたい…
 
And when I fall I won't fall very far
So make a wish and catch this falling star
Tonight I'll lose myself inside your eyes
Tonight They'll be no turning back defeating wrong for right
Rock and roll would you be my hero
Could you be my savior if I called your name
Rock and roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know You'll rescue me somehow
Here we go rock and roll now
And when I cry I won't cry very long
He always knows I just sing his favorite songs
Tonight I'll lose myself inside your eyes
Tonight They'll be no turning back defeating wrong for right
Rock and roll would you be my hero
Could you be my savior if I called your name
Rock and roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know You'll rescue me somehow
Here We go rock and roll now
Here We go rock and roll now
Would you ever be my friend
The type to marry in the end
Could you hang your suit up for my love
All those helpless boys and girls
Calling out around the world
Need you much more tonight than this lovesick little girl
Tonight I'll lose myself inside your eyes
Tonight They'll be no turning back defeating wrong for right
Rock and roll would you be my hero
Could you be my savior if I called your name
Rock and roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know You'll rescue me somehow
Rock and roll would you be my hero
Could you be my savior if I called your name
Rock and roll can't hold on must let go and fall away
But I know You'll rescue me somehow
Here We go rock and roll now
Here We go rock and roll now
Here We go rock and roll now
 
パフィー「とくするからだ」の歌詞
例えば才能とてもある 二人を見くらべよう
片方はまあまあ ひとりはグー どっちが雇われる
女の人に限った 話はしていないよ
男の人に限って うろたえる
厳しい そしてややこしい
平成を生き残れるのは
見た目も ちょっとステキな 働き者
見事な人になりましょう カンペキにしましょう
今からビシッと鍛えよう このからだ
いつかは沈むよ 太陽よ
ふつうの弱い僕らが 神様に与えられた物は
やさしく そして丈夫な 心意気
見事な人になりましょう カンペキにしましょう
見事なボディーになりましょう もう
トリコにさせましょう
何かとお得な思いを するからだ
お花も水なきゃ 萎れる
さあ見事な人になりましょう カンペキにしましょう
今からビシッと鍛えよう このからだ
いつかは沈む 太陽よ そして満月になって 照らすのよ
