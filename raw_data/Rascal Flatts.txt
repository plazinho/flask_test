Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long, ooh!
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long, mmm yeah
If you are going my way (You are going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (All night long)

There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eyes
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (Life is a highway)
I want to ride it all night long (Wooh, yeah)
If you're going my way (Going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (Ooh, yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, I want to ride it all night long, babe)
If you're going my way (You going my way)
I want to drive it all night long
 
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yeah)

Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

That God bless the broken road
That led me straight to you
Oooh
 
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh


What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

Not seeing that love in you
That’s what I was trying to do
 
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything, more than anything

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish

I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you and the place you left
I hope you always forgive and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you'd find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything, yeah, more than anything

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish
Yeah, yeah
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things, too
Yeah, this is my wish (My wish for you)

This is my wish (My wish for you)
I hope you know somebody loves you (My wish for you)
May all your dreams stay big (My wish for you)
 
There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

It's yours if you want it

Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

Oh, oh
I swear, every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby, your name is written on it
Baby, it's yours if you want it
 
She got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

Oh, she does
Back to life
 
Sprayed my name on a water tower
Carved it in an old cottonwood tree
Signed a bunch of high school yearbooks
So they wouldn't forget about me
It wasn't 'til I saw my daddy's name in stone I knew
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die?
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

When you're down to your last dollar
Will you give or will you take?
When the stiff wind blows the hardest
Will you bend or will you break? (Will you break?)
You're gonna leave a legacy, no matter what you do
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you

Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you


Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die
What did you choose? (What did you choose?)
Oh, when it all comes down
It ain't if, it's how they remember you

How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you
How they, how they remember you (How they remember)
How they, how they remember you (How they remember you)
 
I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like ain't it me that keeps pushing you away
How any nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left?
Waking up in a stranger's bed
Don't know how I got lost
I don't know how to get back
Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed
Every morning I hear you pray for the old me
Instead of waking up, in a stranger's bed

I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a strangers bed

I know I say too little
Yeah, I'm gone too much
I don't even remember the last time we touched
Every night it's like you're sleeping with someone you've never met
And waking up in a strangers bed
I remember the words that you haven't heard for so long
You're not gone yet

I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a strangers bed
Oh no, oh woah

I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what i say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away

I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
Well, I'm gonna run back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe, you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Ooh
 
It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone

I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go

It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh, it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh, but when it rains

I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let you fall

Don't be afraid to fall
I'm right here to catch you
I won't let you down
It won't get you down
You're gonna make it
Yeah, I know you can make it

'Cause I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
And I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
Oh, I'm gonna hold you
And I won't let go

Won't let you go
No I won't
 
Someone let your secret out
Everybody 'round here's talking about, how your knight in shining armor let you down
And now you're alone, I told you so
This is what you wanted, baby, now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around, are you happy now?
Oooh, are you happy now?

Yeah, you're gonna  spend some sleepless nights
Crying in the glow of the TV light
With some sad song on and a glass of wine
Just to sit in the pain, baby, what a shame
This is what you wanted, baby now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around
Are you happy now?

Now that I'm not around (now that I'm not around)
Now that you've finally lost what you thought that you needed
Never would have treated your heart like you did

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
Oh, we were so in love, oh, but you gave that up
Just look around
Just look around

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
We were so in love (we were so in love)
But you gave that up (but you gave it up)
Just look around
Just look around
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

What goes around comes back around
 
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Love the sound of the thunder rolling
Makes you move a little closer to me
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, and I love the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do (I like the sound, I like the sound of that)
 
You must have been in a
Place so dark
You couldn't feel the light
Reachin' for you through
That stormy cloud
Now here we are
Gathered in our little hometown
This can't be the way
You meant to draw a crowd

Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

Now in my mind I'll keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game
When you took the stage
You'd shine just like the sun

Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
Oh, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, , God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song

Now the oak trees are swaying
In the early autumn breeze
A golden sun is shining on my face
Through tangled thoughts
I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place

Oh why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
They were wrong, they lied
Now you're gone and we cry
Cause it's not like you to walk away
In the middle of a song

Your beautiful song
Your absolutely beautiful song
 
I can usually drink you right off of my mind
But I miss you tonight
I can normally push you right out of my heart
But I'm too tired to fight
Yeah the whole thing begins
And I let you sink into my veins
And I feel the pain like it's new
Everything that we were
Everything that you said
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do
Plays through tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one, it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up

Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice
But I can't forget
Now I'm all out of ideas and, baby
I'm down to my last cigarette
Yeah, you're probably asleep deep inside of your dreams
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to see
Yeah, wherever you are, baby now I am sure you moved on
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one, it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming

I know that you're movin' on
I know I should give you up
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip
And fall back in love
Time's not healin' anything
Baby, this pain is worse than it ever was
I know that you can't hear me
But baby I need you to save me tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up

Oh, I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Oh, I'm dreaming
 
I was sitting on a wooden stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
There were tear stains on his old shirt
Then he said do you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards

You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
Your get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First night in jail with Charlie
It sounds a little crazy, a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards

Well I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said wait a minute that's not all there's even more

You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And the rake and the mower
You go back when life was slower
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Oh play that song
Woo!

We sat there and talked about how it would be
If we could just rewind it all and go back in T-I-M-E

You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
Your get the farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
That old black cat named  Charlie
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And the rake and the mower
You go back when life was slower
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
 
I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and youre left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
 
You feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless, like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright

'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand

Life's like a novel with the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon with only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on

'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, yeah, then you stand

Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place, yeah

'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Yeah, then you stand
Yeah, baby
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Then you stand, yeah yeah
 
We broke up, yeah, it's tough
Most guys would've been crushed
Wasting their time, wondering where they went wrong
No way, not me
Hey, I'm doing just fine
I'm not afraid of moving on

It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy every time I see her out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single guy does
But what she, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy

The truth is I miss lying in those arms of his
But I don't ever let it show
I laugh and I act like I'm having the time of my life
As far as he knows

It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single girl does
But, what he, what he don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
Oh, it's easy

Oh, it's easy going out on a Friday night
Oh, it's easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
Forget about the way, oh
But, what she, oh what he don't know, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, it looks so easy
So easy, yeah-ooh
 
Staring at you taking off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling
 
Wish I could reach up and reset that sun
Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up
Went by so fast oh so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine
Oh

I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

I turn back that radio dial, reopen your door
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore
Re-spin you around replay that sound, of you laughing when we hit the ground
I can see it now how bout we

I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

I wanna re-fall and re-fly
Baby re-live this night

I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

I'm wishing I could rewind
I wanna relive this night
So good, so right
 
Hey baby, is that you?
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
"Norma Jean", ain't that the song we'd sing in the car?
Driving downtown, top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah, that's what I'm doing

Someone told me after college, you ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there, once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too
Well, hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around his sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend
And until then...

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
These days

Baby

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these...
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
