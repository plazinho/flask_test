My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
You don't wanna see me live
You don't want me to give
Cause you're one of them
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them
Yeah!

War, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
I might not know what a friend is
All I know is what you're not
Cause you're one of them
Them
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them
Yeah!
You're one of them
This time, this time
This lie
My life, my death
I have a prediction; it lives in my brain
It's with me everyday; it drives me insane
I feel it in my heart, that if I had a gun
I feel it in my heart, I'd wanna kill some
I feel it in my heart, the end will come
Come on
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them
Tell me that I'm wrong
Try to sing me your ego song
You're one of them
My war, you're one of them
You say that you're my friend
But you're one of them
Them, them, them, them, them

You're one of them
You're one of them
I can't believe you
You're one of them
And you're one of them
And you're one of them
And you're one of them
One of them, them, them
Them, them, them, them, them
My war!
 
Jealous cowards try to control
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
They distort what we say
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Try and stop what we do
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
When they can't do it themselves
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

Society's arms of control
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Laugh at us behind our backs
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
I find satisfaction in what they lack
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

We're born with a chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
I am gonna have my chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
We're born with a chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
And I am gonna have my chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us it's no use

Rise above! Rise above!
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
We're gonna rise above! We're gonna rise above!

I'm gonna go berserk
'Cause I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders

Gonna be a white minority
We don't believe there's a possibility
But you just wait and see
Gonna be white minority
White pride: You're an American

Gonna be a white minority
There's gonna be large casualties
If we don't find a new territory
We're all gonna die

Right here, all by myself

The situation is bleeding me
There's no relief for a person like me

Depression's got a hold of me
Depression, I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold on me
Depression's gonna kill me

I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls that want to touch me
I don't need your goddamn sympathy

This fucking city
Is run by pigs
They take the rights away
From all the kids

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Walking down the street
I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Nothing I do
Nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked
They put me away

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

No fuckin' way
Motherfuckers gonna pay
Motherfuckers gonna pay

I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail
I may serve time

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way
 
Who are you with? Where have you been
Imagination streams thoughts, reason can't come in
Staring at the walls, I think I know what I see
Anger and coffee, feeding me

Drinkin' black coffee, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, starin' at the walls
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee
Starin' at the walls, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, drinkin' black coffee
Starin' at the
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart

But it's all in my mind, mind, mind, mind
It's just in my mind
It's just in my mind
Yeah!

My heart is pounding as I stare at the wall
It's my turn to be jealous; now, I don't stand so tall
In fact, I'm pretty stupid; I'm feelin' small
Anger and coffee, feeding me

Drinkin' black coffee, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, starin' at the walls
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee
Starin' at the walls, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, drinkin' black coffee
Starin' at the
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart

As the night goes on, paranoia engulfs me
Why should I be so stupid when I can't really see
The other side of the wall is eating away at me
Anger and coffee, feeding me

Drinkin' black coffee, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, starin' at the walls
Black coffee, black coffee, black coffee
Starin' at the walls, black coffee
Drinkin' black coffee, drinkin' black coffee
Starin' at the
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart
Stab through my heart
 
My name's Henry
And you're here with me now
My life
It's a song daaahh
It's so you won't even let it happen
You won't
You won't let
DAMAGED
By attacks
I'm evil attacking my mind
But you don't mind
Cause this scheduled 13
You just sit, down
Buy the ticket
Wait your turn
Waaaaahhhhahahaha
Wooaharhhhhhhhhahh
Aaghhhhhhhh
Waaaaaghghhh
Aaghhhhhhhh
Can't feel another day
Can't get past you
I can't see nothin'
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
Hold out your hand to me
Give me your hand
..And I'll bite it off
DAMAGED!
DAMAGED!
DAMAGED!
Hrraagh!
I...
I don't even care about self-destruction anymore
What's the use?
I just sit at home alone
Cold fingers, gold fingers, in a cold sweat
And then I remember
I remember a day
We'd go for a ride in the country
And you'd say..
Sing it boy
Do it again
Do it again
Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir oh yes sir yes sir yes
Arghh
Right now look at me now
Look at me now
Just shadows
I'm just shadows of what I was
I just want another thing
I couldn't even get by for that
How much is that to ask for?
How- How much?
DAMAGED
Oh waawhhh
I, I'm sorry my friend, I guess I just can't
Lesson other thing nice
It's nice and cool around here
It's nice
It's my mind
It's my mind that's off guard
And no one comes in
Nobody comes in
Damaged
My damage
No one comes in
Stay out
 
Do you want the family man or do you want the swingin' man?
You choose
(Family man)
You get the family man

Family man
FAMILY man
Family MAN
With your glances my way, taken no chances on the new day
Family man
Family man with your life all planned
Your little sand castle built
Smiling through your guilt
Family, man
Here I come
Here I come family man
I come to infect. I come to rape your woman
I come to take your children into the street
I come for YOU family man family man
With your christmas lights already up
You're such a man when your puttin' up your christmas lights, first on the block
Family man
Family man, I wanna crucify you to your front door, with nails
From your well stocked garage, family man, family man
Family man
Saint dad. Father on fire. I've come to incinerate you
I've come home
 
Sun's comin' up and I can't decide
To spill my emotions or keep 'em inside
Go for a drive, go to the store
I'm lookin' for somethin' that can't be found there
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile
Would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway

I conceal my feelings so I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide, can't decide
Can't decide anything
I can't decide, I can't decide
I can't decide anything

Every time I open my mouth
I always wish I had kept it shut
I gotta spill my guts, but I don't dare
I take a look around; I know that no one else cares
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile
Would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway

I conceal my feelings so I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide, can't decide
Can't decide anything
I can't decide, I can't decide
I can't decide anything


I conceal my feelings so I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide, can't decide
Can't decide anything
I can't decide, I can't decide
I can't decide anything

Sun's comin' up, I still can't decide
To spill my emotions or keep 'em inside
Goin' for a drive, then I'm goin' to the store
I'm lookin' for somethin', but I still don't know what for
I always wear a smile
Because anything but a smile
Would make me have to explain
And they wouldn't understand anyway

I conceal my feelings so I won't have to explain
What I can't explain anyway
I can't decide, I can't decide
Can't decide anything
Can't decide, I can't decide
I can't decide anything
No, no!
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
 
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
(One, two, three, four)

Sitting here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off


I gotta go out
Get something for my head
If I keep on doing this
I'm gonna end up dead


I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved
With an atom bomb


Sitting here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off
 
This feeling haunts me
Behind these eyes
The shell seems so empty
Though I wonder if anything lives inside?
I want to live
I wish I was dead
My heart aches to bleed
I'm cheated from what I see
Freedom holds a double-edge for me
I look in your eyes and see...
I want to live
I wish I was dead
I don't want to think
I'm stuck here and I know it
I don't want to see
Make me close my eyes
I want to live
I wish I was dead
Life's cold
And it reaches inside
I need to feel
But turn my mind off
The desperation begins
From the start I see the end
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right
I've got to close my eyes
I look in your eyes
And see its always this way
Live the lie and take a dive
Just to make it die
I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've just got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes
I've got to close my eyes
 
I put my fist through the door
I hate myself for you
I love you
Suspicion rules my very soul
My knives are sharp, my thoughts are cold
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
I can't talk, I can't think
My feelings burn inside of me
I love you
I run through the door to the liquor store
The doors are closed, the tension grows
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
I practice my knife, I feel the power
I look in the mirror, and I-I wanna destroy her
I love you
I gave you my life, but what did I get
Now it's time to take it back
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
I hear a car, your footsteps outside
Knife in hand, love in heart
Sweating, I wait
I love you
You screamed, you bled, you laid on the floor
But now I know that you won't leave me no more
I love you, I love you
Because I love you
 
Tonight, I sit right down in my room
Going over it and over it and over it again
Something's got a hold of me
And I just can't seem to shake myself loose
Let me go, let me go
I'm surely breakin' up
Tonight I'm gonna make that body pay, tonight I'm gonna make that body scream
Tonight I'm gonna drop to my knees

I want you to feel like you make me feel
I hope that I'm gonna make you feel
Like you make me feel
Like you always

There's a lover in my heart, killer in my hands
Whiskey on my breath
Someone handed me a ladder
And for the longest time I've been climbing to the bottom of it
Someone reached out and gave me their hand
And for the longest time I've been tryin' to dislodge my teeth from it
My life's a piece of shit that got caught in my shoe
And I've been grinding that stink into the dirt for a long time now
Now, now, now

I wanna make you feel like you make me feel
I wanna make you feel like you make me feel
Now, now, now, now
Now


I think you stuck my friend with knives
Dragged him out so he could die
One in his heart and three in each side
Knives
One in his heart and three in each side
One in his heart and three in each side
Knives
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Stick me
Stick me (Stick me)
Knives (Stick me)
One in his heart and three in each side
One in his heart and three in each side
Knives, knives, knives
Go ahead
Stick me, stick me, stick me
Knives
Knives, no (Stick me, stick me, stick me, stick me, stick me)
 
One, two, three, four!
Some day I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
Theyll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't want to be dead
Someday we'll all be rich
Someday I won't listen to you bitch
I'll turn up the volume
And give 'em all the shit to play
Just for you
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't want to be dead
Someday I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
Theyll take away the part that hurts
And let the rest remain
Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't want to be dead
Fix it!
 
Beat my head against the wall one more time
Will this solve my problems at all?
I don't care about parties or a good time
I won't stand in your line
Swimmin' in the mainstream
Is such a lame dream
No method to the madness
Beat my head against the wall
Tension builds up so quickly
My judgment becomes affected
And without my even knowin' it
I have started to act like a bitch
Swimmin' in the mainstream
Is such a lame, lame dream
No method to the madness
Beat my head against the wall

Running around like a chicken without a head
Pardon me for bouncing around in bed
But the next day I'll still feel the same
I'll find a way to blast again
Swimmin' in the mainstream
Is such a lame, lame dream
No method to the madness
Beat my head against the wall
 
Nothing, nothing
Nothing left inside

Love, love
Nothing left inside
Pain in my heart, pain hurts my heart
Nothing left inside

Lies, your lies
Nothing left inside
I built it up, I broke it down
Nothing left inside

Leech, drain me dry
Nothing left inside

Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely boy
Nothing left inside
I wanna see you
I wanna see you
I want you to see my eyes

Nothing, nothing
Nothing left inside
Nothing, nothing
Nothing left inside
Nothing left inside
Nothing left inside
Nothing left inside
Nothing left inside
