She leaves early
He'll never know (merdre, merdre)
Cuz our poor boy (merdre, merdre)
Believes in chance (merdre, merdre)
He'll never get
The modern dance
Under the door (merdre, merdre)
An eye on the place (merdre, merdre)
He watches for
The shadows race (merdre, merdre)
Watch real close (merdre, merdre)
Look real fast (merdre, merdre)
He's in touch
It'll never last (merdre, merdre)
Cuz our poor boy (merdre, merdre)
Believes in chance

I wanna make a deal with you girl
And get it signed by the heads of state
I wanna make a deal with you girl
Be recognized round the world
It's my

Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign it)

At night I can see the stars on fire
And I can see the world in flames
And it's all because of you girl
Or your thousand other names

Peggy, Carrie Ann and Betty Jean
Jill, Joan, Jan and Sue
Alice, Cindy, Barbara Ann, you know
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl, you know

The girls won't touch me 'cause I've got a misdirection
Living at night isn't helping my complexion
The signs all saying it's a social infection
A little bit of fun's never been an insurrection

Mom threw me out 'til I get some pants that fit
She just won't approve of my strange kind of wit
I get so excited, I always gotta lose it
Men that send me off made me take the cure

D-d-don't need a cure
D-d-don't need a cure
D-d-don't need a cure
Need a final solution
I don't need a cure
D-d-don't need a cure
D-d-don't need a cure
Need a final solution

Buy me a ticket to a sonic reduction
Guitars gonna sound like a nuclear destruction
Seems I'm a victim of natural selection
Meet me on the other side, another direction
D-d-don't need a cure
D-d-don't need a cure
D-d-don't need a cure
Need a final solution
I don't need a cure

Oh

It was the first thing that I saw
Oh, you never see that kind of Classical Girl
Understand that it was the first thing that I saw
That was fate
(It was the ballistics, mon!)
That was fate
It was a world, what a world!
What a world? What a big world
What a world to be drowned in
It's just a joke, mon!
It's just a joke, mon!
It's just a joke, mon!
Another day?
Well SUFFER, for that's the way of the west

I ride a street wave right by her side
And I can hear the city city comin round
The things I say hit the air and seem to fall apart
And I can see the faces faces fallin down
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heart
I get a picture of what it'll be like
I turn the channel round to Channel 43
I see electricity jump and spark
I see electricity uh real and stark
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heart
I ride a street wave right by her side
And I can hear the city city comin round

My baby says
We can live in the empty spaces of this life
My baby says
Far away the stars are coming all undone
My baby says
My baby says, But that's far away
And we're young
My baby says
And if the devil comes we'll shoot him with a gun
My baby says
We can live in the empty spaces of this life
My baby says
In the desert sands
Our hearts are brighter than the sun
My baby says
When the devil comes we'll shoot him with a gun

My baby says, And if he shows his face
We'll laughEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Dog day afternoon
By the sea
I think about you
I wonder what to do
Sorrow's hangin' over me

Let me walk with you
Cause it's breaking my heart
The things that we had
The good and the bad
Now it's parking lots
Don't let's talk about tomorrow
Baby, standin' at the edge of sorrow
Let's watch the whole world goin' slow
Let's watch the whole world goin'

I know my way 'round town
Used to live around here
I know the sites to see
The things they mean to me
And how we tore it down

Let me walk with you
Cause it's breaking my heart
The things that we had
The good and the bad
Now it's parking lots
Don't let's talk about tomorrow
Baby, standin' at the edge of sorrow
Let's watch the whole world goin' slow
Let's watch the whole world goin' slow
Uh-huh
It was a dream
Nah, but it was a tin can
Not a dream, man, it was a tin can
Ha ha!
Had I not kicked that
Had I not kicked that
Had it clattered
In the gutter
When it bounced
Down the sidewalk
Had I not
Keep that

Don't let's talk about tomorrow
Baby, standin' at the edge of sorrow
Let's watch the whole world goin' slow
Let's watch the whole world goin' slow
Let's watch the whole world goin'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Life stinks
I'm seeing pink

Flew off early in the haze of dawn
In a metal dragon lost in time
Skimming waves of an underground sea
In some kind of dreamworld fantasy
Sun a hot circle on a canopy
'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea
Ahead the dim blur of an alien land
Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands
Dark flak spiders bursting in the sky
Reaching twisted claws on every side
No place to run, no place to hide
No turning back on a suicide ride
Toy city streets crawling through my sights
Sprouting clumps of mushrooms like a world surreal
This dream won't ever, ever end
And time seems like it'll never begin
30 seconds and a one way ride
30 seconds and no place to hide
30 seconds and a one way ride
30 seconds and no place to hide
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over Tokyo
30 seconds over TokyoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He'll be the red guard
She'll be the new world
He'll wear his grey cap
And she'll wave her red book
He'll tell her
One way?
I want you all ways
One way
And then they'll sing
I was lost at sea
She was lost with me
Then across the broad horizon
Out on the Big Waves
I saw it coming
I saw the red guard
I saw the new world
I saw the Big Wall
Out on the Big Waves
Hooray!
(That's what I had to say)
Hooray!
We will purify
We must purify
For the sake of that security we all want
We will purify
He'll be the red guard
She'll be the new world
He'll wear his grey cap
She'll wave her red book1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Maybe you see further than I can see
Maybe things all just look differently (Maybe you see further than I can see)
Maybe I'm nothing but a shadow on the wall
Maybe love's a tomb where you dance at night
Maybe sanctuary is a electric light
I get so tired it's like I'm another man
And everything I see seems so underhanded
And I don't see anything that I want
And I don't see anything that I want
Image, object and illusion go down to the corner
Where none of the faces fit a human form
Where nothing I see there isn't deformed
Where in a secret lab works Doctor Moreau
And no private eye's gotta tell me it's a long goodbye
I get so tired it's like I'm another man
And everything I see seems so underhanded
And I don't see anything that I want
And I don't see anything that I want

Have you heard about this house?
Inside, a thousand voices talk
And that talk echoes around and around
The windows reverberate
The walls have ears
A thousand saxophone voices talk
You should hear how we syllogize
You should hear
About how Babel fell and still echoes away
How we idolize
Theorize
Syllogize
In the dark
In the heart
All I hear is...
Talk!
All I hear is...
Talk!
Hear the sound of the jibberty jungle
In the dark, a thousand insect voices chitter-chatter
The sun goes up
Goes over
Goes down
I seek sleep
I sleep

It's pretty cute the way she tucks me in at dawn
And how I pray that I never should sin again
Uh oh
Here it comes
It's goin over my head
It's over my head
In the gas her eyes are imagined
And what she sees cannot be detected
It's over my head
That, she said, and that went by
This, she says, and this may too
Oh no
There it goes
It's over my headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Welcome to Mars! It's open all hours
"What are we doing here?"
Bill's in the back and Fred's on the phone, sayin'
"What are we doing here?" (Oh, he was sayin' that?)
You are never alone in the Twilight Zone
"What are we doing here?"

Waiting. For. Mary
Waiting. For. Mary
Waiting. For. Mary
Oh

I oughta know but my memory is goin'
"What are we doing here?"
As bad as it seems, maybe we're dreamin'
"What are we doing here?"
Don't mind the stares we've paid for these chairs
"What are we doing here?"
And keep up that smile, it might be awhile
"What are we doing here?"

Waiting. For. Mary
Waiting. For. Mary

Oh
Oh, I
Wonder why
She can't be
On time
Ever?

What do you know, it had to be snowing!
"What are we doing here?"
I'm down on my knees, I'm begging you please
"What are we doing here?"
Oh, what do you see? Why, it had to be me!
"What are we doing here?" (Sayin'... I was sayin'... What?)
Now, one at a time or all in a line, say it:

I heard the radio sun
Made the day like a beach
Lost & in love
I was sand in the surf
I heard talk
Talk like music
I heard talk
It was a day like a beach
No cult
No revision
I was saying
At the curb
I was swaying
I was wave-washed
Wave-washed
Knocked down!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I see her nearly everyday
Just a girl but she's okay
I figure if she's heaven sent
New disclosures should be imminent
Real strain could be evident
Metaphysics would be provident
I'd sure to be obedient
I'd love to be penitent
Here she comes
And then there she goes
Cloud one, four, nineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
