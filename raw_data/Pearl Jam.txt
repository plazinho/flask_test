Hey, hey, yeah, uh

Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Mm, and all I taught her was everything
Mm, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
Mm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be, yeah
Mm, mhm, oooh

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?
Ooh, ah yeah, ah, ooh
Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo, doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo

At home drawin' pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a "V"
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Clearly, I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget? And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard

Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today

Alone, listless
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violence
Center of her own attention
The mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above
Oooh ooh

Don't call me daughter, not fit to be

Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation

Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before

The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
That's not a negative thought
I'm positive, positive, positive
Falling down, not staying down
Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before

Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor
We're stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Couldn't lift up the forget-me-nots
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world

I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
(I know the girls wanna dance away their circumstance)
(I know the boys wanna grow their dicks and fix and file things)
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight up ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"Hold me, darling, just a little while"
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Ooh, ooh-ooh21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I've got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What they've taken is more than a vow
They've taken your innocence
And then they throw em on a burning pile

All along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"

I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience!
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me want to cry
Ah ah ay ay

All along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

And all along they're saying
Mind your manners
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

Go to Heaven
That's swell
How do you like your living hell?
Go to Heaven

I seem to recognize your face
Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me

Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away

I swear I recognize your breath
Memories, like fingerprints, are slowly raising
Me you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see

I just want to scream, "Hello
My god, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are, and here I am"
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade...10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What the fuck is this world running to?
You didn't leave a message
At least I could have learned your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could be my time by you
Would you hit me? Would you hit me?
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, aw

All the bills go by and initiatives are taken up
By the middle there ain't gonna be any middle anymore
And the cross I'm bearing home ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch, left the porch
Oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh
Hear my name, take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand, walk beside me
I just need to say


Oh, oh-oh
Hear my name, take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand, lie beside me
I just need to say
I could not take, oh, just one day
I know when I would not ever
Touch you, hold you, feel you in my arms
Never again

I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, release me

I'll relive it, without pain
Hm, back-street lover on the side of the road
I gotta bomb in my temple that is gonna explode

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah

Oh, try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?
Hm, Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah


You think I got my eyes closed
I've been looking at you the whole fucking time

Yes I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah others they've got none
Stay with me...
Let's just breathe...

Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
Yeah I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me
You're all I see...

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me

As I come clean...
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, oh no
Nothing you would take

Hear the sirens, hear the sirens

Hear the sirens, hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we’re safe, I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear

Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
I danced in laughter, with the ever after
But all things change, let this remain

Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
For every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand
Oh, it’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings
Made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks
Or apologize

I couldn't breathe
Holding me down
Hand on my face
Pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged
United by fear
Forced to endure
What I could not forgive

I seem to look away
The wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled

Head at your feet
Fool to your crown
Fist on my plate
Swallowed it down
Enmity gauged
United by fear
Tried to endure
What I could not forgive, yeah
Saw things, saw things
Saw things, saw things
Clearer, clearer
Once you were in my rear-view mirror
I gathered speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all
I'm far away
Hard to believe
Finally the shades are raised
Hey, yeah

Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer

Saw things so much clearer

The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here, and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run, but I can't walk
Guess I'll lie alone just like before

I'll take the varmint's path
Oh, and I must refuse your test
A-push me, and I will resist
This behavior's not unique

I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before

I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it off in blood let I be wed
I'm already cut up and half dead
I'll end up alone like I began
Everything has chains
Absolutely nothing's changed
Take my hand, not my picture
Spilled my tincture

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't be what you want because I...

Why ain't it supposed to be just fun?
To live and die, let it be done
I figure I'll be damned
All alone like I began

It's your move now
I thought you were a friend, but I guess I...
I guess I hate you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
