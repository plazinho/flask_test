You jealous desert
Why can't you see
You are a treasure
I've seen the world
I love you better
Oh, Tenere!
You are the treasure
Of my soul

English:
The desert is mine
Tenere, my homeland
We come to you when the sun goes down
Leaving a trail of blood across the sky
Which the black night wipes out
The desert is hot
And its water hard to find
Water is life and soul
To all my brothers I say
The desert is jealous!
Oh, Tenere!
A jealous desert
Why can't you see
You are a treasure
I've seen the world
I love you better
Oh, Tenere!
You are the treasure
Of my soul
I cry out to God on High
To bring together my people
In unityEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Walking through it
Walking in the winter
The desert
Then I see it
My beloved
Dancing through fire
Dancing through fire
The ideals of the people have been sold off cheap, my friends
Any peace imposed by force is bound to fail
And give way to hatred
My people, where is that self-confidence
Made of dignity and beauty of spirit
That our ancestors bequeathed to us?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

God can bear witness when I think of Chaghaybou
The pain in the stomach that takes hold of me
Has no other remedy than a heart-to-heart with him late at night
I love him and I love those he loves, into the life beyond
I pine for those handsome and brave wearers of double turbans!
Amongst them Ahmad, Hamad Ahad and their friend, Chaghaybou:
The same who dine on grilled ram
When I glimpse him dressed in his beautiful robes
Smelling of a mixture of perfumes...
His headdress crested, giving him the air of gazelles
That race through dunes strewn with desert gourds
If only I could become a stand in his mother's tent
That way I would never miss a moment he inhabits
Especially those when his mother is teaching him Tifinagh
In the sandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

WAR TOLIHAM ID'KOUFAR WAR TOLIHAM D'ARABAN
You who resemble neither a westerner nor an Arab
TOMANAM ISTIWSATEN TIDIT TINDARAWAN
Your faith in the tribes blinds you to the truth
WADA AL ASSAWKA IYALAH WALAIYEN DOWAN ADAHAR
Even if God were to send a blessing down for you to share

With a friend, they will only betray your confidenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Friends, companions, hear my truth
And my conviction
These banishments that befall us
Bring no joy, neither to my heart
Nor to that of the youth
You suffer the bitterness of that oppression
Which annihilated the old folk
On whom you counted
And tortures the soul of the heart
That knows no hatredEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Youth of the Sahara
We’re telling you how it is
You mustn’t doubt our aptitude
Or think we’re incapable
That world out there is more advanced
And more powerful than we are
Because it awoke before we did
Now we will awake ourselves
We’ve learned how to use other weapons
Than those our ancestors bequeathed to usEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Friends and fellow travellers, I want to tell you
That what touches the heart cannot be hidden
And all that enters it will wound
Today’s love is like a mirage
The closer you get, the further away it goes
It’s been ten years since love left me
Since it deserted my soul
And no longer crosses my pathEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Tired I'm tired
Of searching for that which is not
I search and I ask God
How can I fall asleep and wake up
Without memories, without suffering
The spirit free like
Someone in love
In life we only follow
Love and then we run after it
Until it disappears, after a bend
Buried like a lost truth
Since birth
I have lived like that
And since the first day
Of my life, I walk
The memory of a love in my head
In my heart and in my bonesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess, I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
Don't push me
Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying
Not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop, hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady, livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag
Said, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
Was circon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me
Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying
Not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My brothers doin' bad, stole my mothers t.v
Says, she watches to much, is just not healthy
"All my children" in the daytime, "Dallas" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife, when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon king kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A midrange migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane!
Don't push me
Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying
Not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My son said, "daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think, I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps"
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, cause it's crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun, cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say you want some more, livin on a seesaw
Don't push me
Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying
Not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
A child is born, with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows, what you go through
You grow in the ghetto, living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place, that you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
You'll admire all the number book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers and even pan-handlers
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null 'n void
Walking 'round like you're pretty boy floyd
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did
Got send up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a may tag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
So, don't push me
Cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying
Not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going underEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
