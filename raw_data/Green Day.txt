I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-


I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue128EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Say hey!
Cha!

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday! (Hey!)

Three, four!
"The representative from California has the floor."

Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday!69EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Fuck...

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life


It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life...73EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?


When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I82EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of "none of the above"
On a steady diet of
Soda-pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in Hell
As far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me



At the center of the Earth, in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says "home is where your heart is," but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)



I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't

Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled, but never saved
From the cradles to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia!

Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe
(Said it's, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe

And I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)

Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented, or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

(Ooh, ooh) Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
(Ooh, ooh) Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh



To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I've walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time!


I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken

Home
You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Are you leaving home?74EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep, but running out
As time ticks by, still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind

On my own, here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

On my own, here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine, my senses dulled
Past the point of delirium

On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

On my own, here we go

This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution
The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated

I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo

Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (Ah-ah)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or give me head (Ah-ah)
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (Ah-ah)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or give me head (Ah-ah)
Broadcasting from my room and playin' with my toys

I wanna be a celebrity martyr (Ah-ah)
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!) Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier
I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private movie (Holy War!)
Oh, baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta
For this is love, or it's World War Zero!
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah


I wanna be a celebrity martyr (Ah-ah)

I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit
I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration, huh!

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will (We will!)
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm tripping away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only
If you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
What's your pleasure and what is your pain? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you dream too much? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, "We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame"

Jimmy died today (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
He blew his brains out into the bay (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
In the state of mind (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's my own private suicide

Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world, and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough, and he had plenty
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

(Ah-ah) So far away, I don't wanna stay (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me out of here right now (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) I just wanna be free, is there a possibility? (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me out of here right now
(Out, out, out, out) Right!
This life-like dream ain't for me!


I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here

Left me here alone
And I shoulda stayed home
After ten cups of coffee I'm thinking...
(Where'd you go?) Nobody likes you, everyone left you
(Where'd you go?) They're all out without you, havin' fun
(Where'd you go?) Everyone left you, nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?) They're all out without you, havin' fun

(Where'd you go, go, go, go?)

Jeez! *sigh*

I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over twenty-two days
(Don't want to be an American idiot!)
So get off my case, off of my case, off of my case!

Hey!

Here they come, marching down the street (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
Their time has come, and it's goin' nowhere (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Nobody ever said that life was fair, now (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bare
In the summer heat

The world is spinning 'round and 'round out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb, and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going...

Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

(Ooh) I started fuckin' running as soon as my
(Ooh) Feet touched ground
(Ooh) We're back in the barrio
(Ooh) And to you and me, that's Jingle Town

She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream

I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry ol' Whatshisface?

I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

Remember, whatever

The regrets are useless in my mind

She's in my head, I must confess
(Remember, whatever)
The regrets are useless in my mind

She's in my head, so long ago

Starry nights, city lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found, city-bound in my dreams

And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

Forget me nots, second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails, fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie

Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, having fun

Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
A flunky only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse

The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life

It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning, it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothing left to analyze
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?
And don't look back

You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America

It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning, it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late

Well, she said, "I can't take this town

Dear mother, can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home

I'm obsessed with the poison and us
What a mess 'cause there's no one to trust

St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Lights on the silhouette, he's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of one, two
One, two, three, four!

My name is Jimmy, and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves, and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
Shh! Shh! Shh! St. Jimmy!

My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
I'm the one that's from the way outside, now
A teenage assassin executing some fun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
In the cult of the life of crime, now
I really hate to say it, but I told you so
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, ol' boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found

It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy, and that's my name
And don't wear it out!21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
