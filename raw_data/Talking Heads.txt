And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"
And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving and water removing

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

You may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"
You may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"
And you may ask yourself, "Am I right? Am I wrong?"
And you may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?"

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was and look where my hand was
Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Letting the days go by, same as it ever was
Here a twister comes, here comes the twister
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by)
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by)
Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I can't seem to face up to the facts
I'm tense and nervous, and I can't relax
I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire
Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire

Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, fa, better
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Oh, oh

Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, fa, better
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aye-ya-ya-ya-ya

You start a conversation, you can't even finish it
You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything
When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed
Say something once, why say it again?

Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, fa, better
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away

Ce qu'elle a dit, ce soir-là

Je me lance, vers la gloire, okay
Aye-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yeah
We are vain and we are blind
I hate people when they're not polite

Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me 'round
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it, the better
We'll make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing

Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time
Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be
Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, I go
Ooh...50EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ah
Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool, babies - strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire, ah!

All wet, here, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect?”
Gonna burst into flame, ah

Burning down the house

My house is out of the ordinary
That’s right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire, ah

Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto
I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey-dovey
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime
I might not ever get home
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C.B.G.B
I ain't got time for that now

Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody'll see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
I ain't got time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
I don't know what I look like
You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive
Get your instructions
Follow directions--3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands
The hand speaks
The hand of a government man
Well, I'm a tumbler
Born under punches
I'm so thin
All I want is to breathe (I'm too thin)
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space so we move in-between (In-between it)
And keep one step ahead of yourself

Don't you miss it? Don't you miss it?
Some 'a you people just about missed it
Last time to make plans, well, I'm a tumbler
I'm a government man
Never seen anything like that before
Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor (But I'm a tumbler)
When you get to where you wanna be (Thank you, thank you)
When you get to where you wanna be (Yeah, don't even mention it)
Take a look at these hands, they're passing in-between us
Take a look at these hands!
Take a look at these hands, you don't have to mention it
No thanks, I'm a government man

Well, we know where we're going
But we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowing
But we can't say what we've seen
And we're not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it out
Yeah

We're on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
I'm feeling okay this morning
And you know
We're on the road to paradise
Here we go, here we go

We're on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
Maybe you wonder where you are
I don't care
Here is where time is on our side
Take you there, take you there
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere

There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
Would you like to come along
You can help me sing the song
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride

Lost my shape, trying to act casual
Can't stop, I might end up in the hospital
Changing my shape, I feel like an accident
They're back to explain their experience

Isn't it weird? Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away, that was the policy

I'm ready to leave, I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be
There's nothing there, no information left of any kind
Li-lifting my head, lo-lo-looking for the danger signs

There was a line, there was a formula
Sharp as a knife, facts cut a hole in us
There was a line, there was a formula
Sharp as a knife, facts cut a hole in us

I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
The feeling returns whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head, looking around inside

The island of doubt, it's like a taste of medicine
Working by hindsight, got the message from the oxygen
M-m-making a list, find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right, facts are useful in emergencies

The feeling returns, whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head, looking around inside

Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts aren't lazy and facts aren't lame
Facts don't come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of men

I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I-I-I'm still waiting

Sometimes the world has a load of questions
Seems like the world knows nothing at all
The world is near, but it's out of reach
Some people touch it, but they can't hold on

She is moving to describe the world
(Night must fall, now! Darker! Darker!)
(She has got to move the world, got to move the world, got to move the world)
She has messages for everyone
(Night must fall, now! Darker! Darker!)
(She has got to move the world, got to move the world, got to move the world)
She is moving by remote control
(Night must fall, now! Darker! Darker!)

Hands that guide her are invisible
(Night must fall, now! Darker! Darker!)
(She has got to move the world, got to move the world, got to move the world)

The world has a way of looking at people
Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong
She loves the world and all the people in it
She shakes 'em up when she start to walk
She is only partly human being
(Divine to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
(She wanna define, so say so, so say so)
She defines the possibilities
(Divine to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
(She wanna define, so say so, so say so)
Holding on for an eternity
(Divine to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
(She wanna define, so say so, so say so)
Gone, ending without finishing
(Divine to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
(She wanna define, so say so, so say so)


The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves, and it swivels and bops
The world moves on a woman's hips

I, who took the money?
Who took the money away?
I, I, I, I, it's always showtime
Here at the edge of the stage
I, I, I, wake up and wonder
What was the place, what was the name?
We wanna wait, but here we go again

I, takes over slowly
But doesn't last very long
I, I, I, I, no need to worry
Everything's under control
O-U-T, but no hard feelings
What do you know? Take you away
We're being taken for a ride again

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She has the smoke in her eyes
She's coming up, going right through my heart
She's gonna give me surprise
I think it's right, better than this
I think you can if you like
I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair
And nothing is better than that (is it?)
Down, down in the basement
We hear the sound of machines
I, I, I'm driving in circles
Come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over?
Nothing was lost, everything's free
I don't care how impossible it seems

Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
Get closer to be far away
And only one look and that's all that it takes
Maybe that's all that we need
All that it takes, I'll bet it's right
All it takes, if it's right
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
And she goes wherever she likes (there she goes)

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
Now everyone's getting involved
She's moving up going right through my heart
We might not ever get caught
Going right through, try to stay cool
Going through, staying cool
I got a girlfriend, she's better than that
And nothing is better than you (wait a minute)
I got a girlfriend that's better than this
But you don't remember at all
As we get older and stop making sense
You won't find her waiting long
Stop making sense, stop making sense
Stop making sense, making sense
I got a girlfriend, she's better than that
And nothing is better than this (is it?)4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What about the time you were rollin' over
Fall on your face, you must be having fun
Walk lightly, think of a time
You'd best believe this thing is real
Put away that gun, this part is simple
Try to recognize what is in your mind
God help us, help us to surmise
These slippery people help us understand

What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I see his face (The Lord won't mind)
Don't play no games (He's alright)
Look from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel

I remember when sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug, the water was runnin' out
Cool down, stop actin' crazy
They're gonna leave and we'll be on our own
Seven times five, they were living creatures
Watch 'em come to life right before your eyes
Backsliding, how do you do?
These slippery people gonna see you through
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know? (The Lord won't mind)
No, no, no games (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel


What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I see his face (The Lord won't mind)
How do you know? (He's alright)
And we're going to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I see his face (The Lord won't mind)
How do you know? (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)

Here we stand
Like an Adam and Eve
Waterfalls
Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
Birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs, cars have run on gasoline
Where? Where have they gone?
Now, it's nothing but flowers

There was a factory
Now there are mountains and rivers
You've got it, you've got it
We caught a rattlesnake
Now we've got something for dinner
You've got it, you've got it
There was a shopping mall
Now it's all covered with flowers
You've got it, you've got it
If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawn mower
You've got it, you've got it

Years ago
I was an angry young man
I'd pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With the beautiful highway
This used to be real estate, now it's only fields and trees
Where? Where is the town?
Now, it's nothing but flowers

The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that we'd start over
But, I guess I was wrong

Once there were parking lots
Now it's a peaceful oasis
You've got it, you've got it
This was a Pizza Hut
Now it's all covered with daises
You've got it, you've got it
I miss the honky tonks
Dairy Queens, and 7-Elevens
You've got it, you've got it
And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
You've got it, you've got it


I dream of cherry pies
Candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies
You've got it, you've got it
We used to microwave
Now we just eat nuts and berries
You've got it, you've got it
This was a discount store
Now it's turned into a cornfield
You've got it, you've got it
Don't leave me stranded here
I can't get used to this lifestyle3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Everyone is trying
To get into the bar
The name of the bar
The bar is called Heaven
The band in Heaven
They play my favorite song
Play it once again
Play it all night long

Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens

There is a party
Everyone is there
Everyone will leave
At exactly the same time
It's hard to imagine
That nothing at all
Could be so exciting
Could be so much fun
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens

When this kiss is over
It will start again
It will not be any different
It will be exactly the same
It's hard to imagine
That nothing at all
Could be so exciting
Could be this much fun

Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happensEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

I wanna know, can you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

I wanna know, can you tell me?
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Push me in the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, I can't take no more

Dip me in the water, drop me in the river
Push me in the water, drop me in the river
Washing me down, washing me down

I don't know why I love her like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I, the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know, can you tell me?
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down
Ooh, a-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

Ooh, a na na na
A na na na na, ah!
A na na na, hoo!
A na na na, ooh!

Ha! Na na na na, ah!

Hey!

And she was lying in the grass
And she could hear the highway breathing
And she could see a nearby factory
She's making sure she is not dreaming
See the lights of a neighbor's house
Now she's starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes

The world was moving and she was
Right there with it, and she was
The world was moving she was
Floating above it, and she was
And she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
And she's drifting this way and that
Not touching the ground at all
And she's up above the yard
The world was moving and she was right there with it
And she was
Hey, hey
The world was moving she was floating above it
And she was
Hey, hey, hey

And she was glad about it, no doubt about it
She isn't sure about what she's done
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was
Hey, he-hey, hey!

And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions, oh, oh, oh

Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey hey, hey (hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey hey, hey
The world was moving, she was right there with it
And she was
The world was moving, she was floating above it
And she was

Joining the world of missing persons
And she was (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Missing enough to feel alright
And she was, ha, ha

And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was, hey, hey
And she was
And she was
And she was3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
He serves the foreigners in growing numbers
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
He dreams of days that he can still remember, now
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Mojique sends the package to the American man
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
He feels the time is surely now or never, more

The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart come to
Drive them away, drive them away
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart come to
Drive them away, drive them away

Mojique buys his equipment in the market place
Mojique plants devices through the Free Trade Zone
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
He knows his friend, the wind, is always standing... by
Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
He feels the presence of the wind around him
He feels the power of the past behind him
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him on
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
(Come to)
Drive them away, drive them away
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
(Come to)
Drive them away6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I see the clouds that move across the sky
I see the wind that moves the clouds away
It moves the clouds over by the building
I pick the building that I want to live in

I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods
I see the pinecones that fall by the highway
That's the highway that goes to the building
I pick the building that I want to live in

It's over there, it's over there
My building has every convenience
It's gonna make life easy for me
It's gonna be easy to get things done
I will relax along with my loved ones
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building
Take the highway, park and come up and see me
I'll be working, working but if you come visit
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important

Don't you worry 'bout me
I wouldn't worry about me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
I see the states across this big nation
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C
I think of the ones I consider my favorites
I think of the people that are working for me

Some civil servants are just like my loved ones
They work so hard and they try to be strong
I'm a lucky guy to live in my building
They own the buildings to help them along

It's over there, it's over there
My building has every convenience
It's gonna make life easy for me
It's gonna be easy to get things done
I will relax along with my loved ones
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building
Take the highway, park and come up and see me
I'll be working, working but if you come visit
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important

I wouldn't worry 'bout me
I wouldn't worry about me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He would see faces in movies, on TV, in magazines, and in books
He thought that some of these faces might be right for him
And that through the years, by keeping an ideal facial structure fixed in his mind
Or somewhere in the back of his mind
That he might, by force of will, cause his face to approach those of his ideal
The change would be very subtle
It might take ten years or so
Gradually his face would change its shape
A more hooked nose
Wider, thinner lips
Beady eyes
A larger forehead

He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people
They had also molded their faces according to some ideal
Maybe they imagined that their new face
Would better suit their personality
Or maybe they imagined that their personality
Would be forced to change to fit the new appearance
This is why first impressions are often correct

Although some people might have made mistakes
They may have arrived at an appearance
That bears no relationship to them
They may have picked an ideal appearance
Based on some childish whim, or momentary impulse
Some may have gotten halfway there
And then changed their minds
He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Everybody, get in line
Nothing can come between us
Nothin gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy
Nothing turns you on
Somebody is waiting in the hallway
Somebody is falling down the stairs
Set someone free, break someone's heart
Stand up, help us out
Everything is divided
Nothing is complete
Everything looks impressive
Do not be deceived
You don't have to wait for more instructions
No one makes a monkey out of me
We lie on our backs, feet in the air
Rest and relaxation, rocket to my brain
Snap into position
Bounce till you ache
You step out of line and
And you end up in jail
Bring me a doctor
I have a hole in my head
But they are just people
And I'm not afraid
Doctor, Doctor
We have nothing in our pockets
We continue
But we have nothing left to offer
Faces pressed against the window
Hey, they are just my friends
Check this out, don't be so slick
Break our backs, it goes like this
We are born without eyesight
We are born without sin
And our mama protects us
From the cold and the rain
We're in no hurry
Sugar and spice
We sing in the darkness
And we open our eyes (open up)
Oh, I can't believe it
And people are strange
Our president's crazy
Did you hear what he said?
Business and pleasure
Lie right to your face
Divide it in sections
And then give it away
There are no big secrets
Don't believe what you read
We have great big bodies
We got great big heads
Run-a-run-a-run it all together
Check it out, still don't make no sense
Makin' flippy floppy, tryin' to do my best
Lock the door, we kill the beast
Kill it5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I'd be able to do these things

And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he's at
He can't afford to stop, that is what he believe
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years

I'm walking a line, I'm thinking about empty motion
I'm walking a line, just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way, no time to begin
This isn't the time, so nothing was done
Not talking about, not many at all
I'm turning around, no trouble at all
You notice there's nothing around you, around you
I'm walking a line, divide and dissolve

Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope
I'm walking a line, I hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line, just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way, no time to begin
This isn't the time, so nothing was done
Not talking about, not many at all
I'm turning around, no trouble at all
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line, divide and dissolve

I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
I'm moving twice as much as I was before
I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
I'll be down in there moving the in the room...

I'm walking a line, I'm visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line, just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way, no time to begin
This isn't the time, so nothing was done
Not talking about, not many at all
I'm turning around, no trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line, divide and dissolve1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
