Sometimes the rain

Gettin' down with the sounds around
Oh, the smell of the mornin' flower
As we pass away the hour
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it (Do it)
Let's do it in the mornin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
Feeling your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Sweet love in the midnight
Good sleep, come mornin' light
No worries 'bout nothin'
Just gettin' good, just gettin' good
Just gettin' good love
Do it, do it again
Do it again (Do it)
Do it
Now I like you, lady
So fine with your pretty hair
If you don't mind my compliments
Just diggin' on the clothes you wear

I wanna do it again
(Do it) (Do it, do it) I wanna do it again
Ooh, oh, ho, hey, do it again
Do it

Love began to rock
Give the sister love and pride
Feel good and satisfied
I'm not a girl that you linger
But I feel like a Butterfinger
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it, do it
Let's do it in the mornin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
Feeling your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Sweet love in the midnight
Good sleep, come mornin' light
No worries 'bout nothin'
Just gettin' good, just gettin' good
Just gettin' good love

If you disrespect anybody
That you run in to
How in the world do you think
Anybody's supposed to respect you?
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man
With the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way
And let the gentleman do his thing
You're the kind of gentleman
That want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na, na, na, na
Respect yourself, respect yourself

If you're walking 'round
Thinkin' that the world
Owes you something
'Cause you're here
You're goin' out
The world backwards
Like you did
When you first come here
Keep talkin' 'bout the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand on your mouth
When you cough, that'll help the solution
Oh, you cuss around women folk
And you don't even know their names
And you're dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big ol' man

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na, na, na, na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself

March for freedom's highway
March each and every day
Made up my mind and I won't turn around
Made up my mind and I won't turn around
There is just one thing
I can't understand my friend
Why some folk think freedom
Was not designed for all men
...
Yes I think I voted for the right man
Said we would overcome
 
Paroles de la chanson Wade In The Water :
(Chorus)
Wade in the water
Wade in the water, children
Wade in the water
God's gonna trouble the water
Well, who are these children all dressed in red?
God's a-gonna trouble the water
Must be the children that Moses led
God's a-gonna trouble the water
Chorus
Who's that young girl dressed in white
Wade in the Water
Must be the Children of Israelites
God's gonna trouble the Water
Chorus
Jordan's water is chilly and cold
God's gonna trouble the water
It chills the body, but not the soul
God's gonna trouble the water
Chorus
If you get there before I do
God's gonna trouble the water
Tell all of my friends I'm coming too
God's gonna trouble the water
Chorus
See that ban' all dress'd in white?
It look lak the childr'n of the Israelite
See that ban' all dress'd in red?
It look lak the ban' that Moses led
Wade in de water
Wade in de water
Wade in de water
God's a-gonna trouble de water
I stepped in water and the water is cold
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water
Said it chilled my body but not my soul
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water
Chorus
Well I went to the water one day to pray
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water
And my soul got happy and I stayed all day
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the wate
 
Why am I treated so bad
Why am I treated so bad
You know I'm all alone
While I sing this song
Hear my call
I've done nobody wrong
But I'm treated so bad
Ohh so bad
I'm gonna run
Up to my baby's door
Ask him why
Why, why
He don't love me no more
He was wrong
Said I was too vain
But I'll walk on in
And love him just the same
Thought he treats me so bad
Ohhh so bad
 
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
We have worked this country from shore to shore
Our women cooked all your food and washed all your clothes
We picked all your cotton and laid the railroad steel
Worked our hands to the bone at your lumber mill
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
We fought in your wars in every land
To keep this country free, y'all, for women, children, and men
But anytime we ask for pay alone
That's when everything seems to turn out wrong
We've been beat up (Beat up)
Called names (Called names)
Shot down and stoned
But every time we do right, someone say we wrong
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
We have given our sweat and all our tears
We stumbled through this life for more than 300 years
We've been separated from the land which we knew
Stripped of our culture, people you know it's true
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
Will we ever be proud of "My country, 'tis of thee?"
Will we ever sing out loud, "Sweet Land of Liberty?"
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
Tell me now, for the work we've done
Will we ever have peace and harmony?
I wanna know, will we ever be paid?
When will we be paid for the work we've done?
 
I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand and "No", was all he said
Take a load off, Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny and
(And, and)
You can put the load right on me
I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown"
She said, "I gotta go but my friend can stick around"
Take a load off, Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny and
(And, and)
You can put the load right on me
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke and Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay
And keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off, Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny and
(And, and)
You can put the load right on me
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rack if you'll take Jack, my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man"
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"
Take a load off, Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny and
(And, and)
You can put the load right on me
Catch a cannon ball now, take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
Take a load off, Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny and
(And, and)
You can put the load right on me

They tell me of a home far beyond the skies
And they tell me of a home far away
They tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
They tell me of an unclouded day
The land of cloudless days
The land of an unclouded sky
They tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
They tell me of an unclouded day

Who took the merry out of Christmas?
(People all over the world forgot about merry)
Too busy fighting wars, trying to make it to Mars
Searching for light and can't seem to find the right star
Oh, (Searching for light and can't seem to find the right star)

Who took the merry out of Christmas?
(People all over the world forgot about merry)

Searching for light and can't seem to find the right star
Making believe He was just another baby boy

How sweet and happy seem, those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet, my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
Chorus
If I could only hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her, tender voice as then
How happy I would be, ?would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again
Within the old home place, her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear
She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting in His love I seek that home above
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day
Her work on earth is done, the life crown has been won
And she is now at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and love
 
Can the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, bye and bye?
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day;
And I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Lord, I told the undertaker
"Undertaker, please drive slow
For this body you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go."
I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Went back home, Lord. My home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone!
Now my mother, she's crossed over
Where so many have gone before;
And I know, Lord, I will meet her
Just waiting at glory's door
 
Are you sure there's nothing you can do
To help someone worse off than you?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?
Are you sure it'll be a waste of time
To stop and let your love light shine?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?
Are you sure that it will be in vain
To show some love for your fellow man?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Think about it and be sure
Are you sure?
Are you sure that it's not your place
To help someone whose lost their way?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?
Are you sure it's not your concern
When you see a neighbor's home is burned?
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?
Are you sure that I will still be down
When you've realized that you've been blind
Think before you answer, are you sure?
Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Think about it and be sure
Please, please, please be sure
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure? Are you sure?

Cross my heart
And I don't hope to die
No more tears
Because I don't have to cry
But this morning
I can see there is a brighter day
And we become stronger because of sacrifice
Inspiration is what you gave to my life

It's true, the love of You
Spiritual affection, lifelong protection
Jesus, I just wanna thank You, thank You

It's been fun
And all the things we've done
Through His footsteps
All the work has been done
Funky music will never destroy the faith and love we enjoy
Oh, bless my soul
That it's not out of control
Makes it easy (Make it easy), to release the world at its hold
Funky city, oh, ain't it pretty?
Funky and witty, work for the boss
We carry the cross

Jesus, I just want to thank You (Give us this day)
Oh, hey, He'll show you the way
Jesus is love (Jesus, Jesus, Jesus)
Jesus is love

Oh, everybody nappin', slappin' hands and rappin'
Keep tryin' to pull through
But for the love and protection
Where is the action?
Who will show you what to do? (What to do)
And no longer and all because of You
Will we crawl on the back road of no-can-do
From now on, we travel the highway of sweet rejoice, oh
We become stronger because of sacrifice
Inspiration is what You gave to my life

It's true, the love of You
Spiritual affection, lifelong protection
Jesus, I just wanna thank You (Thank You)
(Give us this day)
He'll show you the way
Jesus is love (Jesus, Jesus, Jesus)
Jesus is love

Oh, it makes it kinda nice with the everyday life
When these days seem kinda down
Helps you make, make a choice
If you listen to my voice, you can find the faith
Shop around, shop around
No longer all because of you
Shall we crawl on the back road of no-can-do
From now on, we travel the highway of sweet rejoice
Ooh, we become stronger because of sacrifice
Inspiration is what You gave to my life

It's true, the love of You
Spiritual affection, lifelong protection
Jesus, I just wanna thank You (See the pretty city, ooh, ain't it pretty?)
