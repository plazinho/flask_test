Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Little Jackie Paper
Loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax
And other fancy stuff
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Together they would travel
On a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a look-out
Perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes
Would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags
When Puff roared out his name

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

A dragon lives forever
But not so, little boys
Painted wings and giants' rings
Make way for other toys

One grey night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon
He ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow
Green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
Along the cherry lane

Without his lifelong friend
Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon
Sadly slipped into his cave
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way
This a-way, this a-way, this a-way, this a-way
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way

If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I think of you
Every song I sing I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring (I'll wear your ring)

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the time I won't have to say (I won't have to say)

Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me
"Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree"
"Don't put your faith in love, my boy" my father said to me
"I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree"

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day she left without a word, she took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind I knew what she had done
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the windEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And all the little children that round your table grow
The cattle in your stable, the dog by your front door
And all that dwells within your gates, we wish you ten times more

I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand
I'll love you more than anybody can
And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time

The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime

I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes
And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
Whisper all the joy that is mine

The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime

I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand
I'll love you more than anybody can
Mmm
Mmm
The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chimeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Peter performs this song by leading the audience to sing along. He divides them into three groups, each with their own part. The lyrics are provided here for each of the three parts
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Oh, rock my soul
So high I can't get over it
So low I can't get under it
So wide I can't get round it
Oh, rock my soul
Rock my soul

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there were somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could've done better but I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all rightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The cruel war is raging, Johnny has to fight
I want to be with him from morning 'til night
I want to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
That your Captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

I'll tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
I'll pass as your comrade as we march along
I'll pass as your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny, I fear you are unkind
I love you far better than all of mankind
I love you far better than words can e're express
Won't you let me go with you?
Yes, my love, yes
Ooh

All my trials Lord, soon be over

I had a little book was given to me
And every page spelled Liberty
All my trials Lord, soon be over

If religion were a thing that money could buy
The rich would live and the poor would die
All my trials Lord, soon be over

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind
All my trials Lord, soon be over
All my trials Lord, soon be over

There is a tree in Paradise
The Pilgrims call it "The Tree Of Life"
All my trials Lord, soon be over

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind
All my trials Lord, soon be over
All my trials Lord, soon be overEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh Stewball was a racehorse
And I wish he were mine
He never drank water
He always drank wine

His bridle was silver
His mane it was gold
And the worth of his saddle
Has never been told

Oh the fairgrounds were crowded
And Stewball was there
But the betting was heavy
On the bay and the mare

And a-way up yonder
Ahead of them all
Came a-prancin' and a-dancin'
My noble Stewball

I bet on the grey mare
I bet on the bay
If I'd have bet on ol' Stewball
I'd be a free man today
Oh the hoot owl, she hollered
And the turtle dove moaned
I'm a poor boy in trouble
I'm a long way from home

Oh Stewball was a racehorse
And I wish he were mine
He never drank water
He always drank wineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well early in the morning, about the break of day
I ask the Lord, "Help me find the way"
Help me find the way to the promised land
This lonely body needs a helping hand
I ask the Lord to help me please find the way

When the new day's a dawning, I bow my head in prayer
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me there?"
Won't you guide me safely to the Golden Stair?
Won't you let this body your burden share?
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me please, lead me there?"

When the judgment comes to find the world in shame
When the trumpet blows won't you call my name?
When the thunder rolls and the heavens rain
When the sun turns black, never shine again
When the trumpet blows, won't you call me please, call my nameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
So they won't know where I've gone

Freight train, freight train, comin' round the bend
Freight train, freight train, gone again
One of these days turn that train around
Go back to my hometown

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
So they won't know where I've gone

One more place I'd like to be
One more place I'd love to see
To watch those old Blue Ridge Mountains climb
When I ride ol' Number Nine

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
So they won't know where I've gone
When I die please bury me deep
Down at the end of Bleecker Street
So I can hear ol' Number Nine
As she goes rollin' by

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on

Tell me why you're crying, my son
I know you're frightened, like everyone
Is it the thunder in the distance you fear?
Will it help if I stay very near?
I am here

And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done
And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done

Day is done (Oh when the day is done)
Day is done (When the day is done, when the)
Day is done (When the day is done)
Day is done

Do you ask why I'm sighing, my son?
You shall inherit what mankind has done
In a world filled with sorrow and woe
If you ask me why this is so
I really don't know
And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done
And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done

Tell me why you're smiling my son
Is there a secret you can tell everyone?
Do you know more than men that are wise?
Can you see what we all must disguise
Through your loving eyes?

And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done
And if you take my hand my son
All will be well when the day is done

Day is done (When the day is done)
Day is done (When the day is done, when the)

In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early morning rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
But I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Well, the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engine roar (Hear the mighty engine roar)
See the silver wing on high (See the silver wing on high)
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This old airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane (Can't jump a plane)
Like you can a freight train (Like a freight train)
So I'd best be on my way
In the early morning rain
So I'd best be on my way
In the early morning rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh once I had a little dog
His color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle
To sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long
His ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day
Upon him I could ride

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to May

Oh once I had a little frog
He wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane
A top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places
Of things to see and do
And all the kings and queens he'd met
While sailing in a shoe

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to May
Oh once I had a flock of sheep
They grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box
From wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine
They'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings
Candy by the pound

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to May

Oh once I had a downey swan
She was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell
And hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird
The bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale
Would have to tell a lie

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to MayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
