Say, say, my playmate
Won't you lay hands on me?
Mirror my malady?
Transfer my tragedy?
Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish (My mind's aflame)
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and crave gets slaked

My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it
My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that'll blow your Mongrel mind
Baby doll, I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind
It's you, you, you, you

I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go so let me show you
I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
We've got 'til noon, here comes the moon, so let it show you
Show you now

Dream me, oh, dreamer, down to the floor
Open my hands and let them weave onto yours
Feel me, completer, down to my core
Open my heart and let it bleed onto yours
Feeding on fever, down on all fours
Show you what all the howling is for

Hey, hey, my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot, hot, hot, hot here
Got a curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
There's a curse comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Tell your grandma and your mama too
It's true, true, true, true

We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
 
Congratulations on the mess you made of things
I'm trying to reconstruct the air and all that brings
And oxidation is the compromise you own
But this is beginning to feel like the dog wants her bones, say

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You force your fire and then you falsify your deeds
Your methods dot the disconnect from all your creeds
And fortune strives to fill the vacuum that it feeds
But this is beginning to feel like the dog's lost her lead, say

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

This is beginning to feel
Like the long winded blues of the never
This is beginning to feel
Like it's curling up slowly and finding a throat to choke

This is beginning to feel
Like the long winded blues of the never
Barely controlled locomotive consuming the picture
And blowing the crows to smoke

This is beginning to feel
Like the long winded blues of the never
Static explosion devoted to crushing the broken
And shoving their souls to ghost

Eternalized, objectified
You set your sights so high
But this is beginning to feel
Like the bolt busted loose from the lever

Never mind, death professor
Your structure's fine, my dust is better
Your victim flies so high
All to catch a bird's eye view of who's next

Never you mind, death professor
Love is life, my love is better
Your victim flies so high
Eyes could be the diamonds confused with who's next

Never you mind, death professor
Your shocks are fine, my struts are better
Your fiction flies so high
Y'all could use a doctor who's sick, who's next?

Never you mind, death professor
Electrified, my love is better
It's crystallized, so am I
All could be the diamond fused with who's next

This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
This is beginning to feel
Like the dawn of the loser forever
 
My mast ain't so sturdy
My head is at half
I'm searching the clouds for the score
My lady avails herself
Of marked down freedom
Forever cashed out to no more
She put the blam in the blame
Bullets bearing the name
Of each tigress who's left you a tooth
Save the skins for a pelt
And the rest for a belt
That can't open
No nothing
Can't open
No nothing

Young liars
Thank you for taking my hands
Young liars
Oh thank you for taking my hands

Well it's cold and it's quiet
And cobblestone cold in here
Fucking for fear of not wanting
To fear again
Lonely is all we are
Lovely so far
But my heart's still a marble
In an empty jelly jar
Someday suppose that my
Curious nervousness
Spills into prescience
Clairvoyant consciousness
I will be calmer than cream
Making maps out of your dreams
But will psychic ability
Clinch the nativity?
Or simply diminish that flinch?
Oh young liars

Oh young liars
I said thank you for taking my hands
And burying them deep in the world's wet womb
Where no one can heed their commands
Where no one can heed their commands except young liars
Young liars

Voice string trombone
Pull me forward onward
To the sea
Take my picture
Soon all I will be
Is my disease
Voice string trombone
Pull me forward onward
To the sea
Take my picture
Soon all I will be
Is my disease
 
Oui je t'aime, oui je t'aime
À demain, à la prochaine
I know it's best to say goodbye
But I can't seem to move away

Not to say, not to say
That you shouldn't share the blame
There is a softness to your touch
There is a wonder to your ways

Don't know how I feel, what's the deal?
Is it real? When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well, I'm here, won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you, oh, careful you

Don't know, should we stay? Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you, oh, careful you, careful you

Oui je t'aime, oui je t'aime
From the cradle to the grave
You've done a number on my heart
And things will never be the same

Freeze a frame, freeze a frame
From a fever dream of days
We learned the secret of a kiss
And how it melts away all pain

Don't know how I feel, what's the deal?
Is it real? When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well, I'm here, won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you, oh, careful you

Don't know, should we stay? Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you, oh, careful you, careful you

Don't know how I feel, what's the deal?
Is it real? When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well, I'm here, won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you, oh, careful you

Don't know, should we stay? Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you, oh, careful you, careful you
 
Cross the street from your
Storefront cemetery
Hear me hailing from inside
And realize - I'm--
I am the conscience clear
In pain or ecstasy
We are all weaned, my dear
Upon the same fatigue
You're staring at the sun
(Oh, my own voice cannot save me now)
Standing in the sea
(One more breath and then I'll go down)
Your mouth is open wide, the lover is inside
And all the tumult's done, collided with the sun
You're staring at the sun, you're standing in the sea
Your body's over me
Note the trees because the
Dirt is temporary
More to mine than fact, face
Name, and monetary
Beat the skins and let the
Loose lips kiss you clean
Quietly pour out like light
Like light, like answering (the sun)
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide (the sun)
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck (the sun)
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me (the sun)
You're staring at the sun (Be what you will)
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide (And then throw down your life)
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck (Oh, it's a damned fine game)
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me (And we can play all night)
You're staring at the sun, you're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide, you're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck, there's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
 
It might be impractical
To seek out a new romance
We won't know the actual
If we never take the chance
I'd love to collapse with you
And ease you against this song
I think we're compatible
I see that you think I'm wrong

But anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you?

Your love makes a fool of you
You can't seem to understand
A heart doesn't play by rules
And love has its own demands
But I'll be there to take care of you
If ever you should decide
But you don't want to waste your life
In the middle of a lovesick lullaby

But anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you?

Oh my reddest rose, caldera, set it off
How your fire grows hermosa caldera glistening
Through your fussed blows careen your caldera set it off
As your body flows the second hand flashes passes
Over your skin like time

Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
My love
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you
 
Stuck in the shade where there’s no sunshine
I don’t wanna play with them other kids in the sun

Since you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
Yeah, you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, yeah
Ignorance is bliss
I’m a happy idiot
Waving at cars
I’m gonna bang my head to the wall
‘Til I feel like nothing at all
I’m a happy idiot
To keep my mind off you

Stuck in a daze and I’ve lost my mind
I don’t wanna stay where the blame’s all mine

Since you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down
Yeah, you left me, babe
It’s been a long way down

So, I shut it off
So, I shut it all off
So, I shut it off
So, I shut it all off
It’s been a long way down
It’s been a long way down

What you don’t know won’t hurt you, yeah
Ignorance is bliss
I’m a happy idiot
Waving at cars
I’m gonna bang my head to the wall
‘Til I feel like nothing at all
I’m a happy idiot
To keep my mind off you

To keep my mind off you
To keep my mind off you
 
Oh, here comes trouble
Put your helmet on, we'll be headed for a fall
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow
And the devil's got my number
S'long overdue, he'll come looking soon
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow

Oh, here comes trouble
These people talk too much, need to shut 'em up
Yeah, I'd rather be alone
Can you, can you feel that rumble?
All this borrowed time, it's been running out
It's the ending of the show

But I know now, yeah
Yeah, I know now, yeah

"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!"

Oh, I've changed my number
Wore disguises and went undercover just to
Just to hide away from you
All my ghosts came a' calling
Making noises 'bout a promise I had broken
Oh, I'm gonna be lonely soon

Oh, here comes trouble
Put your helmet on, we'll be headed for a fall
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow
And the devil's got my number
S'long overdue, he'll come looking soon
Yeah, the whole thing's gonna blow

"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!" (I'll be okay)
Oh, I keep telling myself
"Don't worry, be happy!"
Oh, you keep telling yourself
"Everything's gonna be okay!"

"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
"Everything's gonna be okay!"
 
Under my love
Wake up to your window
The day calls in billows
It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart
In cozy red rainbow
It's shaking off halos
And the memory of our sacred so and so
Oh, take my hand sweet
Complete your release, unbury your feet
And married we'll be
Alone in receiving ours is a feeling not that they would see
They don't know that we could be
Down where your cradle escaped the sea
And your raven haired mama caught told you so's

We're hanging in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

Ah me all mine
Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently
Call me on time
And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully
All into line
There's a garden grave and a place there saved for me
I fall by your side
Though your silver haired mama throws told you so's

We're hanging in the shadow of your family tree
Your haunted heart and me
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep it young

And now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree
In halted harmony
Brought down by an old idea whose time has come
And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree
There's a hundred hearts or three
Pumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us young
 
How much do I love you?
How hard must we try
To set into motion
A love divine?
I should really give it up sometime
Should've known by the way things started
That I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometime
No reprieve for the broken hearted
Yeah, I should really give it up sometime
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
Hey, there it goes
Into sun, stream and marigolds
I am yours, you are mine
Through a lifetime of disagreements
Take me high, take me low
Take me nowhere my poor heart can't follow
Reckless hearts soon collide
Break through a lifetime of stress and evil
I should really give it up sometime
Should've known it couldn't last forever
But I should really give it up sometime
And I should really give it up sometimes
All I wanted was to love you better
But I should really give it up sometime
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
I don't want what you want
Oh, come and get lost, love
Why wrestle the tide?
All set into motion
Our love divine
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
And now it's rolling down the wave
Rolling down the wave into the fire
How much do I love you?
How hard must we try?
How deep is the ocean?
 
Hope it isn't broken, tried to keep it open
But I couldn't hold it, smashed it down for all to see
And I tried to get repairs done, I couldn't fix it
So, I picked it up and smashed it down for all to see

But I remember when we were so cool
And you were the only one
And now I know that I was such a fool
Thinking you're the only one

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way
And be the first test pilot

Now we're stumbling through the motions, criminal and careless
Thought you were my best friend, now I couldn't care less, can't you see?
And you're playing my emotions, way out of proportion
Damage and distortion, blasting through your fantasy

Oh, but I was such a fool
Thinking you're the only one
It didn't have to be so cruel
Thinking you're the only one

I know that we get down
But we can't touch the ground
Look up, fall into sky
Gone at the speed of sound
One circle back around
Straight on, test pilot, fly

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way

(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are gliding through the things that tear us apart
(You know we are) We are high, and we are fine
(You know we are) And we are going to need the strength it takes to pave the way
And be the first test pilot
 
I was a lover before this war
Held up in a luxury suite, behind a well-barricaded door
Now that I've cleaned up, gone legit
I can see clearly, round hole
Round hole, square peg don't fit
I'm locked in my bedroom, so send back the clowns
My clone wears a brown shirt
And I seduce him when there's no one around
Mano y mano on a bed of nails
Bring it on like a storm
'Til I knock the wind out of his sails
And we don't make eye contact when we have run-ins in town
Just a barely polite nod
And nervous stares towards the ground
I once joined a priest class, plastic, inert
Slow-danced with commerce
Like a lens up a skirt
And we liked to party
And we kept it live
And we had a three volume tome of contemporary slang
To keep a handle on all this jive
Ennui unbridled, let's talk to kill the time
How many styles did you cycle through before you were mine?
And it's been a while since we went wild and that's all fine
But we're sleepwalking through this trial
And it's really a crime, it's really a crime, it's really a crime
It's really criminal
We're busy tempting like fate's on the nod
Running on empty, bourbon and God
It's been a while though since we knew the way
And it's been even longer
Since our plastic priest class had a goddamned thing
To say
I was a lover before this war
I was a lover before this war
I was a lover before this war
 
The lazy way they turned your head
Into a rest stop for the dead
And did it all in gold and blue and gray
The efforts to allay your dread
In spite of all you knew and said
Were hard to see and harder still to say
A comfort plush all laced in lead
Was sent to quell your sentiment
And keep your trembling sentinel hand at bay
And when a sudden silhouette
Escaped the top side of your bed
I knew you'd never ever be the same
Ah, is it not me
Am I not folded by your touch
The words you spoke, I know too much
It's over now and not enough
Ah, is it not me
The damage you hold inside your blush
The load you towed, you showed it up
It's over now and I'm insane
Wild spirit winds from out your chest
Collides with world and wilderness
It needs a gentle hand to call it home
Now surfs the sun and scales the moon
And winds the waistband of her womb
All eyes ablaze the day you break your mold
Ah, is it not me
Am I not culled into your clutch
The words you spoke, I know too much
We're closer now and said enough
Ah, is it not me
Am I not rolled into your crush
The road you chose unloads control
See it take me so
Go on throw this stone
Into this halfway home
 
Lonely little love dog that
No one knows the name of
I know why you cry out
Desperate and devout
Timid little tether
Your eyes set on the ether
Your moon in a belle Luna and
Howling hallelujah

Nameless you above me
Come lay me low and love me
This lonely little love dog
That no one knows the name of
Curse me out in free verse
Wrap me up and reverse this
Patience is a virtue
Until it's silence burns you

And something slow
Has started in me as
Shameless as an ocean
Mirrored in devotion

Something slow
Has sparked up in me
As dog cries for a master
Sparks are whirling faster

Lonely little love dog
That no one knows the ways of
Where the land is low is
Where the bones will show through

Lonely little love dog
That no one knows the days of
Where the land is low is
Where the water flows to
And holds you
 
Suddenly, all your history's ablaze
Try to breathe, as the world disintegrates
Just like autumn leaves, we're in for change
Holding tenderly to what remains
And all your memories are as precious as gold
And all the honey and the fire which you've stole
Have you running through all your red-cheeked days
Shaking loose these souls from their sacred hiding space

Hold your heart courageously
As we walk into this dark place
Stand steadfast, erect and see
That love is the province of the brave

Pushed under this expanse of bursting stars
Let this burning brightly illuminate the where we are
In this hollow that lovers voices occupy
Let it follow that we let it free, let it fly
Breaking open the walls of this cage
Intoxicated, oh so amazed
Much like falcons tumbling from the heights at play
Conjoined, talons engaged

Hold these hearts courageously
As we walk into this dark place
Stand steadfast beside me and see
That love is the province of the brave
 
I know you eat your lovers when you sense that something isn't right
I hope that's over and you're letting him go
I always wondered what your gypsy heart would feel like
I got a feeling that you're letting me know
I told your sister that you're all I ever dream of
Your sister told me that I better move slow
And then she told me things I never could've dreamed of
And then she told me things I should not have known

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me

I know you've got your reasons when you're keeping your defenses up
It seems to me too much, try letting them go
But hits defeat the misses and we knock each other senseless, love
We come together and we start to move slow
You've got me thinking that you're all I ever need now
I think I love you and it's starting to show
And if you hadn't shown me all the things I never dreamed of
I do not think that I'd be missing you so

Now we face a choice of three
One is you; the other, me
Free as air is third, you see
It's all I wanna be

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground, seeds on ground
 
I see you praying on the dance floor
See you moving so inspired
It's got me wondering what you're asking for
While your soul is setting fires
See, I've been trying locked doors
It's getting kind of tired
Like a lot of a people wanting more
Reach for carrot, want a bite

(You say) Right now
(Have it) Right now
(The moment's) Right now
So, don't hold tight

Revolution, revolution
Rolling back to status quo
While the pace of evolution
Often seems a little slow
But the breath between the split seed
The nothing that it shows
It's the infinite in finite
If you want it, let it know

Say it right now
Play it right now
The moment's right now
Inside the flow

Say it right now
Play it right now
The moment's right now
Come on, let go

Falling into the all-at-once
Letting go of the things they taught
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little things
Past the right now, right now, the right now, love
Letting go of the source of loss
Embracing what can't be bought
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little dream
Past the right now

There's a golden light that's right here
There's no bottom to this well
Wealth of love and wealth of ideas
Peace of mind beyond the self
There's a golden light that's right here
There's no bottom to this well
Wealth of love and wealth of ideas
Peace of mind beyond the self

Breathe in the moment, let it magnify the love
Healing the soul, healing the soul

Falling into the all-at-once
Letting go of the things they taught
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little things
Past the right now, right now, the right now, love
Letting go of the source of loss
Embracing what can't be bought
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little dream
Past the right now
 
He's a what? He's a what? He's a newspaper man
And he gets his best ideas from a newspaper stand
From his boots to his pants to his comments and his rants
He knows that any little article will do!
Though he expresses some confusion about his part in the plan
And he can't understand that he's not in command
The decisions underwritten by the cash in his hand
Bought a sweater for his weimaraner, too
Now I'm no mad man but that's insanity
Feast before famine and more before family
Goes and shows up with more bowls and more cups
And the riot for the last hot meal erupts
Corrupts his hard drive through the leanest months
Shells out the hard cash for the sickest stunts
On aftershave, on gasoline
He flips the page and turns the scene

In my mind I'm drowning butterflies
Broken dreams and alibis
That's fine
I've seen my palette blown to monochrome
Hollow heart clicks hollow tone
It's time

Eye on authority
Thumbprint's a forgery
Boy, is it crazy what the lights can do
For counterfeit community
Every opportunity
Wasted as the space
Between the flash tattoo
And the half-hearted hologram
Posed for the party
Now he gloss full bleed on a deaf dumb tree
Cod liver, dollar signs, credit card, autograph
Down for the record but not for freedom
Angry young mannequin
American, apparently
Still to the rhythm
Better get to the back of me
Can't stand the vision
Better tongue the anatomy
Gold plated overhead
Blank transparency
In the days of old you were a nut
Now you need three bumps before you cut
Not that I should care about
Nothing I am not scared of
But I guess you had to be there

In my mind I'm breeding butterflies
Broken dreams, and alibis
That's fine
I've seen my palette blown to monochrome
Hollow heart clicks hollow tone
In time

I see you figured in your action pose
Foam-injected Axl Rose
Life size
Should something shake you and you drop the news
Lord, just keep your dancing shoes
Off mine
 
Your slim frame
Your eager eyes, and your wild mane
Oh, they keep me where I belong
All wrapped up in wrong
You're to blame
For wasted words of sad refrain
Oh, let them take me where they may
Believe me when I say, oh

I will be your accident
If you will be my ambulance
And I will be your screech and crash
If you will be my crutch and cast
And I will be your one more time
If you will be my one last chance
Oh, fall for me

Your slim frame
Oh, your simple stare and your wrong, wrong name
Oh, they keep me where I belong
All strung out in song
Why so tame?
When we could shoot wilder vines through younger veins
Sip slow from night's deep wells
And watch our garden swell
Once the seeds are sown
Wild and overgrown
You'll see
Hearts colors change like leaves (like leaves)

Oh, sweet, sweet dream fall for me
Fall fast, fall free, fall for me
Because...

I will be your ambulance
If you will be my accident
And I will be your screech and crash
If you will be my crutch and cast
And I will be your one more time
If you will be my one last chance
Oh, sweet dream fall with me
Fall fast, fall free, fall with me
 
Funny now it's all out
See what only nakedness could hide
Something's got you tongue tied
Like you're barely handling the ride
Sentimental storm clouds
Gathering, let's try pray them down
They've been there the whole time
Following from crib, to crawl to walk, to run, to slow

Live and die for it
Simulating blood baths in bed
Or red, we're wed
And unembarrassed to dare this affair with
No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
Your head's your head
But still we're not afraid to share
This with careful awareness

In the middle of the night, when fear comes calling
Sayin' "It all dies, often scared, alone..."
Look into your eyes and feel your calm
Pretty thing that catches me so strong when I fall

Another shining morning
Hand to breast, grief's got you by the lungs
Wanna cease the mourning
But it seems that sad song's never done
Drop cold feet to floor and
Suddenly the whole thing weighs a ton
Same body that you dance in
Bring it back to me, lick, and roll and raise your inner sun

Live and die for it
Swearing by black mass in bed
We're fed, we're wed
And unembarrassed to share this affair with
No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
My head's my head
But still we're not afraid
To say for ourselves what a pair is

In the middle of the light, just wanna be your darling
Running by your side, let me play along
Look into your eyes, see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly beat, just wanna sing its song

Everything's alright, just let me be your darling
Running by your side, nevermore alone
Look into your eyes and see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly beat, just wanna hear its song
