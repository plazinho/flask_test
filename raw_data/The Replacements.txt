Bring your own lampshade, somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, never learn how to swim, now

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then, I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line
At the swingin' party, down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want
Then, I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party, down the line
Everything in time
At the swingin' party, down the line
Catch the time
At the swingin' party, down the line3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane, y'know she's sporting a chain
Same hair, revolution
Same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

Don't get him wrong and don't get him mad
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
And she don't need advice that'll center her
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

Mirror image, see no damage
See no evil at all
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at
The way you're laughed at now
Now, something meets Boy, and something meets Girl
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
Same hair, revolution
Unisex, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
And tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today, the people dress the way that they please
The way they tried to do in the last centuries

And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

If he was from Venus, would he feed us with a spoon?
If he was from Mars, then that'd be cool
Standing right on campus, would he stamp us in a file?
Hangin' down in Memphis all the while

And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
Yeah, I'm in love with that song"

Cerebral rape and pillage in a village of his choice
Invisible man who can sing in a visible voice
Feeling like a hundred bucks, exchanging good lucks face to face
Check-checkin' his stash by the trash at St. Mark's Place

And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round, 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
Well, I'm in love with that song"

I never travel far
Without a little Big Star, ooh-ooh

Runnin' 'round the house, Mickey Louse and tarot cards
Falling asleep with a flop pop video on
And if he was from Venus, would he meet us on the moon?
If he died in Memphis, then that'd be cool, babe

And children by the million wait for Alex Chilton to come around, 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
I'm in love with that song
I'm in love, what's that song?
Yeah, I'm in love with that song"

Oh! Come on!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Ohhh!

God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung
Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
The daughters and the sons

Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom
Elvis in the ground, no way he'll be here tonight
Income tax deduction, one hell of a function
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Now the daughters and the sons

Unwillingness to claim us
Ya got no warrant to name us
The ones who love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest
And visit their graves on holidays at best
The ones who love us least are the ones we'll die to please
If it's any consolation, I don't begin to understand them

Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Wait on the sons of no one, bastards of young
Daughters and the sons

Young
Of young

I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again

Lights that flash in the evening
Through a crack in the drapes

Jesus rides beside me
He never buys any smokes
Hurry up, hurry up, ain't you had enough of this stuff?
Ashtray floors, dirty clothes, and filthy jokes
See you're high and lonesome
Try, try and try

Lights that flash in the evening
Through a hole in the drapes
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
I can't hardly wait

I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait
I can't wait, hardly wait5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst
After a hard day of nothin' much at all
The summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
To take my place in back with the loudmouths
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house

And everybody wants to be special here
They call your name out, loud and clear

Here comes a regular
Call out your name
Here comes a regular
Am I the only one here today?

Well, a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town
And once the police made you go away
And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby, now
I'll take a great big whiskey to you anyway
And everybody wants to be someone's here
Someone's gonna show up, never fear

'Cause here comes a regular
Call out your name
Yes, now here comes a regular
Am I the only one who feels ashamed?

Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes
He says, "Opportunity knocks once, then the door slams shut."
All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy
The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts
First the lights, then the collar goes up and the wind begins to blow
Turn your back on a pay-you-back, last call
First the glass, then the leaves that last, then comes the snow
Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Was you satisfied?
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Hey, are you satisfied?

And it goes so slowly on
Everything I've ever wanted
Tell me what's wrong?

Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfied
Were you satisfied?
Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied
Now, are you satisfied?

Everything goes, well, anything goes
All of the time
Everything you dream of is right in front of you
And everything is a lie

Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm satisfed
Look me in the eye, unsatisfied
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so dissatisfied
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so unsatisfied
Well, uh-- well, I'm-a
I'm so, I'm so unsatisfied
I'm so dissatis-, dissatis-, dissastis...

Read about your band
In some local page
Didn't mention your name
Didn't mention your name
Sweet Georgia breezes
Safe, cool and warm
I headed up north
You headed north

On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?

Weary voice that's laughin'
On the radio once
We sounded drunk
But you never made it on
Passin' through and it's late
The station started to fade
Picked another one up
In the very next state
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on and...

Pretty girl keep growin' up
Playin' make-up, wearin' guitar
Growin' old in a bar
Ya grow old in a bar
Headed out to San Francisco
Definitely not L.A
Didn't mention your name
Didn't mention your name

And if I don't see ya in
A long, long while
I'll try to find you

How young are you? How old am I?
Let's count the rings around my eye
How smart are you? How dumb am I?
Don't count any of my advice

Oh, meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight
If you will dare, I might dare

Call me on Thursday, if you will
Or call me on Wednesday, better still
Ain't lost yet, so I gotta be the winner
Fingernails and cigarettes, a lousy dinner
How young are you?
Oh, oh, oh
Come on!

Meet me anyplace or anywhere or anytime

Drive yourself right up the wall
No one hears and no one calls
It's a boring state
It's a useless wait, I know
Brag about things you don't understand
A girl and a woman, a boy and a man
Everything's sexually vague
Now you're wondering to yourself if you might be gay

Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
One day, baby, maybe help you through

Drive your ma to the bank
Tell your pa you got a date
But you're lying
Now you're lying on your back
Trying to figure out, they wonder what next you'll pull
You don't understand anything sexual
I don't understand
Tell my friends I'm doing fine
And your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny, you ain't laughing, are you?
Sixteen blue
Sixteen

Your age is the hardest age

Try and breathe some life into a letter
Losing hope, we'll never be together
My courage is at its peak
You know what I mean

How do you say you're okay to an answering machine?
How do you say good night to an answering machine?

Big town's got its losers
Small town's got its vices
A handful of friends:
One needs a match, one needs some ice
Call-waiting phone in another time zone

How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do say good night to an answering machine?

(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, hang up and then dial the number...)
I get enough of that
Try and free a slave of ignorance
Try and teach a whore about romance

How do you say I miss you to an answering machine?
How do you say good night to an answering machine?
How do you say I'm lonely to an answering machine?

The message is very plain
Oh, I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
I hate your answering machine
(If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, if you need help, if you need help...
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again

If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again

Hey!
Yeah, kid, it's a-really hip
With plenty of flash and you know it
Yeah, dad, you're rocking real bad
Don't break your neck when you fall down laughing
Donna, wanna, Donna
Yeah, I know, I look like hell
I smoke and I drink and I'm feeling swell
Yeah, I hear you think it's weird
But I don't give a single shit
Yeah, man, it's a-hip, you know what I'm saying
It's a-hip, you know what I'm saying and I hear it
My heart aches, it's a-looking for a dolly
Looking for a dolly, can't you hear it?
Wanna be something
Wanna be anything
Yeah, I know I feel this way
But I ain't gonna never change
Yeah, I hear, I think, I know
Rock don't give a shit, you know

I'll be there in an hour
Take half a month there on foot
Watering hole, scummy waterin' tower
Sit on a boat if I could
I'll be sad in heaven
You won't follow me there
There
Jesus rides beside me
Never buys any smokes
Hurry up, hurry up
I've got enough of this stuff
Ashtray floor, dirty clothes, filthy jokes
Lights flash in the evening
I guess we'll follow them there
I'll be sad in heaven
If I don't find a hole in the gate
Climb on the top of this scummy water tower screamin'
I can't hardly wait
I can't wait
I can't wait

All eyes look up to me
High above the filthy streets
Heed no bullhorn when it calls
Watch me fly and die, watch me fall

I'm the boy they can't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
All the love sent up high to pledge
Won't reach the ledge

Wind blows cold from the west
I smell coffee, I smell doughnuts for the press
A girl that I knew once years ago
Is tryin' to be reached on the phone

I'm the boy she can't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
All the love sent up high to pledge
I'm the boy she can't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
All the love sent up high to pledge

Priest kneels silent, all is still
Policeman reaches from the sill
Watch him try to try his best
There'll be no medal pinned to his chest, yeah

I'm the boy they couldn't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
I'm the boy they couldn't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
I'm the boy for the last time in my life
All the love that they pledge
For the last time will not reach the ledge

You take the skyway
High above the busy little one-way
In my stupid hat and gloves
At night, I lie awake wonderin' if I'll sleep
Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street

But you take the skyway
It don't move at all like a subway
It's got bums when it's cold
Like any other place, it's warm up inside
Sittin' down and waitin' for a ride
Beneath the skyway

Mmm-mmm, mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm

Oh, then one day
I saw you walkin' down that little one-way
Where the place I'd catch my ride most everyday
There wasn't a damn thing I could do or say
Up in the skyway

Oh
Mm, well, well, well, I bought it
Down on all fives
Let me crawl
If I want I could die
Oh, by my hand

Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade

Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Well, well, well
Anyone could tell
Classic awe
A lucky shot
Ooh-leh-do
Hate 'em
Someday soon
Face 'em

Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade

Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Just might, just might, just might

We might crack up in the sun
But we'll lose it in the shade

Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

And hold my life

If it's a temporary lull
Why'm I bored right outta my skull?
Man, I'm dressin' sharp and feelin' dull
Lonely, I guess that's where I'm from
If I was from Canada
Then I'd best be called lonesome
And if it's just a game
Then I'll break down just in case
Hurry up, (hurry up) we're runnin' in our last race
Well, I laughed half the way to Tokyo
I dreamt I was Surfer Joe
And what that means, I don't know
A dream too tired to come true
Left a rebel without a clue
And I'm searching for somethin' to do
And if it's just a game
Then we'll hold hands just the same
So what? (so what?) We're bleeding but we ain't cut
And I could purge my soul perhaps
For the imminent collapse
Oh yeah, (oh yeah) I'll tell you what we could do
You be me for a while and I'll be you
Oh yeah
A dream too tired to come true
Left a rebel without a clue
Won't you tell me what I should do?
Oh, if it's just a lull
Why'm I bored right outta my skull?
Oh yeah, (oh yeah) keep me from feeling so dull
And if it's just a game
Then we'll break down just in case
Then again, I'll tell you what we could do
You be me for a while

After one, and there's one that's long gone
For the moon, you keep shootin'
Throw your rope up in the air

You nap 'em and you slap 'em in a highchair

All you ever wanted

All you're ever losin' is
