Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Cool town, evenin' in the city
Dressin' so fine and lookin' so pretty
Cool cat, lookin' for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
'Til I'm wheezin' like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city

Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryna tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face in somebody's new-mowed lawn
I've been havin' a sweet dream
I've been dreamin' since I woke up today
It's starrin' me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for droppin' my load
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy bull toad
And you can be sure that if you're feelin' right
A daydream will last along into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be dreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Come and talk of all the things we did today
Hear and laugh about our funny little ways
While we have a few minutes to breathe
And I know that it's time you must leave

But darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

And now a quarter of my life is almost past
I think I've come to see myself at last
And I see that the time spent confused
Was the time that I spent without you
And I feel myself in bloom

So darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

So darling, my darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to

Go and beat your crazy head against the sky
Try and see beyond the houses and your eyes
It's okay to shoot the moon

Darling, be home soon
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling, be home soon
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Don't give me a place for my memories to stay
Don't show me an end or a light to find the way
I ain't got time for the things on your mind
And I'm leavin' you today
On my way

Please don't you cry when the time to part has come
It's not for what you've said or anything that you've done
I've got to go anywhere any time
And I'm leavin', gone today
On my way
I'm goin' home


Please don't stick around to see me when I'm feelin' low
Don't pass the cards to me to deal the crushin' blow
I'll even close the door so you won't see me go
When I'm leavin', gone today
I'm on my way

I'll walk away like a shadow in the night
I won't give cause for you to feel we have to fight
I'll make it easy so that you won't really - quite
Know I'm leavin' you today
On my way
And now I'm goin'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I was down in Savannah
Eatin' cream and bananas
When the heat just made me faint
I began to get cross-eyed
I thought I was lost, I'd
Begun to see things as they ain't
As the relatives gathered
To see what's the matter
The doctor came to see was I dyin'
But the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
I was told a little tale
About a skinny as a rail
Eight-foot cowboy with a headache
He was hung-up in the desert slottin' rats
And tryin' to get a drink of water
With his knees a-gettin' mud-caked
And I'll tell you in a sentence
How he stumbled into Memphis
Tennessee, hardly crawlin' lookin' dust-baked
We gave him little water, a little bit of wine
He opened up his eyes
But they didn't seem to shine
And the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
So, if you ever get sickly
Get sis to run quickly
To the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard
And play a guitar chord
And do a little do-it-yourself
Call on your neighbors
To put down their labors
And come and play the hardware in time
'Cause the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
I was floatin' in the ocean
Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy
He was surfin' when he hit me
But jumped off his board to get me
And he dragged me by the armpit
Like a child's toy
As we staggered into land
With all the waders eatin' sandwiches
And tried to mooch a towel from the hoi polloi
He emptied out his eardrums
I emptied out mine
And everybody knows that the very last line
Is the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"
And the doctor said "Give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's really true how nothin' matters
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters
In Coconut Grove
Don't bar the door, there's no one comin'
The ocean's roar will dull the drummin'
Of any city thoughts and city ways
The ocean breezes cool my mind
The salty days are hers and mine
Just to do what we want to
Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly she will speak the stars
Until sunup
It's all from havin' someone knowin'
Just which way your head is blowin'
Who's always warm, like in the mornin'
In Coconut Grove
The ocean breezes cool my mind
The salty days are hers and mine
Just do what we want to
Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly she will speak the stars
Until sun-up
It's really true how nothin' matters
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters
No one's pitchin' cause there ain't no batters

Why must every generation think their folks are square?
And no matter where their heads are they know mom's ain't there
Cause I swore when I was small that I'd remember when
I knew what's wrong with them that I was smaller than

Determined to remember all the cardinal rules
Like sun showers are legal grounds for cutting school
I know I have forgotten maybe one or two
And I hope that I recall them all before the baby's due
And I know he'll have a question or two

Like "Hey pop, can I go ride my zoom?
It goes two hundred miles an hour suspended on balloons
And can I put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue
And imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?"
And I must be permissive, understanding of the younger generation

And then I'll know that all I've learned my kid assumes
And all my deepest worries must be his cartoons
And still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done
Relating to what he can do when he becomes a man
And still he'll stick his fingers in the fan
And "Hey pop, my girlfriend's only three
She's got her own videophone and she's a taking LSD
And now that we're best friends, she wants to give a bit to me
And what's the matter, daddy?  How come you're turning green?
Can it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
You pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Did you ever have to finally decide?
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl

And then you know you better make up your mind
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you a line
And says, "Better go home, son, and make up your mind"

Then you bet you'd better finally decide
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You didn't have to be so nice
I would have liked you anyway
If you had just looked once or twice
And gone upon your quiet way
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
And it's true
You came upon a quiet day
You simply seemed to take your place
I knew that it would be that way
The minute that I saw your face
And when we've had a few more days (When we've had a few more days)
I wonder if I'll get to say (Wonder if I'll get to say)
You didn't have to be so nice (Be so nice)

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to break your heart
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' from the very start
But you kept on a-tryin'
And I knew that you'd end up a-cryin'
And I knew I didn't wanna have to do it at all
Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then
No, I didn't wanna have to be the one to say "The end"
There was a time that I thought our love could fly
And never, never fall
Why should I suppose we were never really meant
To be close to each other at all?
No, I...
Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then

Nashville Cats, play clean as country water
Nashville Cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats, get work before they're two
Well, there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar pickers in Nashville
And they can pick more notes than the number of ants
On a Tennessee anthill
Yeah, there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar cases in Nashville
And any one that unpacks 'is guitar could play
Twice as better than I will
Yeah, I was just thirteen, you might say I was a
Musical proverbial knee-high
When I heard a couple new-sounding tunes on the tubes
And they blasted me sky-high
And the record man said every one is a Yellow Sun
Record from Nashville
And up North there ain't nobody buys them
And I said, "But I will"
And it was
Nashville Cats, play clean as country water
Nashville Cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats, get work before they're two
Well, there's sixteen thousand eight hundred 'n' twenty one
Mothers from Nashville
All their friends play music, and they ain't uptight
If one of the kids will
Because it's custom made for any mother's son
To be a guitar picker in Nashville
And I sure am glad I got a chance to say a word about
The music and the mothers from Nashville
Nashville Cats, play clean as country water
Nashville Cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats, get work before they're two

A younger girl keeps rollin' 'cross my mind

No matter how much I try

And why?

There's something special about six o'clock
In the mornin' when it's still too early to knock
And the dusty light shines down on the block
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock
Six o'clock, six o'clock

A few hours ago she was standin' here
Just watchin' the stars in our eyes and the lights as uptights disappear
And I could feel I could say what I want
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante
And now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front
At six o'clock, six o'clock

I went home and found that tryin' to sleep was a laugh
Just watchin' my eyelids knowin' my brain bids the night not to pass
I got up and got scufflin' around
But somehow it just wasn't the same happy town
And the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound
At six o'clock, six o'clock

If I go back where we parted
Could I ever be like that again?
Guess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow
But what can I do 'til then?
Guess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn
Guess I had to learn goin' back where we were wouldn't help at all
And I wish my head had been workin' right
We'd have gone for coffee and talked all night
But now I'm back alone feelin' twisted up tight
Six o'clock, six o'clock

Now, I'm back alone
Yes, now I'm back alone
I'm back aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sun
You and me, we're gabbin' away
Dreamy conversation, sittin' in the hay
Honey, how long was I laughin' in the rain with you?
'Cause I didn't feel a drop 'til the thunder brought us to
You and me underneath a roof of tin
Pretty comfy feelin', how the rain ain't leakin' in
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour
'Cause the way it makes you look makes me hope it rains some more
You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sunEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
Four eyes and how much do you see now?
How many fingers?
Ha, ha, ha
When your kids that see through plastic with a harness of elastic
So the girls all think you're icky and the boys all think you're queer
Then the hinges all get rusted and the seventh pair gets busted
So you graduate to tortoise shell that makes you look severe
Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
Four eyes and how much do you see now?
How many fingers?
Ha, ha, ha
When you're so blind they call you Batman, you can't even see a fat man
You can't dig just where he's at man without windows on your eyes
But the frames ain't your decision and they're fitted with precision
And they magnify your eyes like they're a pair of cherry pies
Four eyes, what you gonna do now? What you gonna do?
Four eyes and how much do you see now?
How many fingers?
Ha, ha, ha
Here's a word to all you parents, give a break to little Clarence
When he says the blackboard's fadin' and the world's a fuzzy place

Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
Four eyes and how much do you see now?

I'm gettin' tired of runnin' 'round
Believe I'll get married, and I'll settle down
Because this old night life, this mean old sportin' life
You know it's killin' me

And I got a letter from my home
And most of my good friends, they are dead and gone
And it makes me worry, no need to wonder
About the times to come

And Mother used to fall on her knees and pray
And these are the very words she did say
She said, "Oh Johnny, my lovin' Johnny
Won't you please change your ways?"


I've been a gambler and a cheater, too
But now it's come my, my time to lose
Because this old night life, you know she's holdin' the best hand
And what can I do?
And I'm gettin' tired of runnin' 'round
Believe I'll get married and I'll settle down
Because this old night life, ooh it's a bad life
And it's killin' meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I'm just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes and lovin' you

Walkin' all the avenues findin' you
But I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
Now, the reasons never send me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead to calm me down
She can even get me up and on my feet
When I got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone (All my streets alone)
I would keep walkin' keep from goin' home (Keep from goin' home)
I couldn't quite barely conceive of you
Now, I can't conceive of ever leavin' you
'Cause I'm just sittin' back lovin' you
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
If you are wond'rin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin' too?
