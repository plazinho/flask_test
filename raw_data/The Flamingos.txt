My love must be a kind of blind love;
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
 
Mio amore
Take my lips and a kiss them
Take my love
Take my hands and hold them
I am yours my love
Till the end of time
Mio amore
Take my arms let them hold you
Take my love
Take my eyes let them show you
I am yours my love
Till the end of time
Whoo, till the end, till the end
Till the end, till the end of time
Oh my love, oh my love, can't you see?
Woo, our love was meant to be
Oh my love, oh my love
You were meant for me
Mio amore
Take my heart and my soul
Take my love
Our love will never run cold
I am yours my love, till the end of time
Whoo, till the end
Till the end of time, of time
 
Please wait for me; for I shall return;
My love for you will forever burn
Though we must part;
There's no reason to cry
Just say so long;
Because lovers never say goodbye
I love you;
My darling more than life itself
I wouldn't try to hurt you;
For I'd only be hurting my self
Just kiss me dear;
And hold me tight;
For you know this is not our last night
Though we must part;
There's no reason to cry
Just say so long;
Because lovers never say goodbye
 
A kiss, from your lips
Changed my whole life around
A kiss like yours
No where can be found
Gee gee how blest I am
To have a kiss from your lips
A kiss from your lips
Holds a story still untold
A kiss from your lips
More precious oh than gold
Gee gee how blest I am
To have a kiss from your lips
I've loved for many years
And kissed oh oh a thousand lips
But nothing went right
Until that night
I slipped a kiss
From your lips
A kiss from your lips
Changed my whole life around
Gee gee how blest I am
To have a kiss
From your lips
 
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
(Wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
Once more our love will be free
At the corner drugstore
Each Saturday we would meet
(We would meet)
I'd walk you home in the moonlight
All of these things we'll repeat
So darling, as I write this letter
Here's hoping you're thinking of me
My time's about up
So long until I'll be home to start serving you
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
(Wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
All of these things we'll repeat
So, darling, as I write this letter
Here's hoping, here's hoping you're thinking of me
Because my time's about up, doll
So long until I'll be home to start serving you
I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me
(Wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
Once more our love will be free
 
I can't be lying.  Can't you see that I'm crying?
Would I be crying if I were lying to you?
My heart is about to break, I regret making my mistake
My love for you burns the same, and my tears can't put out the flame

Won’t you forgive me, Oh, darling, forgive me
You must believe me, I will always be true
Would I be crying my heart out for you, and hurting the way I do
Would I be crying if I were lying to you

Won’t you forgive me, Oh, darling, forgive me
You must believe me, I will always be true
Would I be crying my heart out for you, and hurting the way I do
Would I be crying if I were lying to you
 
Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken
One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you
 
Tonight
I mustn't think of her
Music maestro please

Tonight
Tonight I must forget
How much I need her
So mister leader

Play
Your  melodies
Ragtime, jazztime, swing

Any old thing
To help me ease the pain
That solitude
Solitude can bring

She used to like waltzes
So please don't play a waltz
She danced divinely
And I love her so
But there I go

Tonight I mustn't think of her
No more memories
Swing out
Tonight I must forget

Music
(Music)
Maestro
(Maestro)
Please
 
For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice
Bless the beasts and the children
For the world can never be
The world they see
Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them
Bless the beasts and the children
Give them shelter from a storm
Keep them safe
Keep them warm
Repeat
Repeat
 
I'm in the mood for love
I'm  in the mood for love

I'm  in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're, when you're near me
I'm  in the mood for love

Heaven  is in your eyes
Bright as the star we're under
Oh,  is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fail
We've  put our hearts together
Now we are one
(I'm not afraid)
No, no, no

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight forget it
'Cause I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood for love
 
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
How long can a girl keep goin'
Like every day's the last
I've paid off the rent and the government
Maybe I could pay off the past
If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
Wouldn't I be on easy street
Livin' this life of mine
I could keep right on till the hurt's all gone
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
If the jukebox took teardrops
And the whiskey was free
And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
 
I still can't believe it, I can't see it
I should just stop counting days
On the subject of the future
Wouldn't it be nice to leave it open-ended
And pretend it could go either way?
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say, yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back, if I could have you back
On the topic of the time we spent together
I can't say I never wondered
If you ever think about these days
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say, yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back
It's game over, you've lost this round
And now I get to turn you down
Thanks for all the lessons learned
I'm taking in what I have heard
Practice makes perfect
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say, yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision
If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back, if I could have you back
I still can't believe it, I can't see it
I should just stop counting days
 
You're the dream of a lifetime
Too sweet to tell it all things right
You're everything I ever hoped for
Sweetheart, will you be mine
You're the dream of a lifetime
With voice like mission bells that chime
And eyes that grow in sweet surrender
Two lips are sweet as wine
Heaven must have sent you
Dear, when I was feeling lonely, sad and blue
Will you be my lover, I don't want another
Please believe me, do
You're the dream of a lifetime
You'll change the autumn days to spring
With you my life would be complete, dear
My heart will always sing
You're the dream of a lifetime
You'll change the autumn days to spring
With you my life would be complete, dear
My heart will always sing
 
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me (she’s not for me)
 
Doo do doo do doo    wop wop

My heart belongs only to you and
I’ll never, never ever, let you go (let you go, never let you go)
I made a vow to love only you and
I’ll never, never ever, let you go (never let you go)

Oh, all the joy we share
No other love could compare
Having no, no regrets
Never to forget (Oh Ohhh)

I believe true love never ever dies and
I’ll never, never ever, let you go (never let you go)

Oh, the joy we share (oh, the joy we share)
No other love could compare (No other love could compare)
Having no, no regrets (Having no regrets)
(Never, never darling forget) (Oh Ohh)

I believe true love never ever dies and
I’ll never, never ever, let you go

Doo do doo do doo    wop wop Doooo
 
When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendour
It brings back a memory evergreen

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavour
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapturous 
'Til clouds come along to disperse the joy we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine
Let them play
'Til the stars that were there before return above you
'Til you whisper to me once more darling I love you

And we suddenly know
(And we suddenly know)
What heaven we're in
(What heaven we're in)
When they begin the beguine
 
(Yours, yours)
(Yours)
Yours 'til the stars
Lose their glory
Yours 'til the birds
Fail to sing
Yours 'til the end
Of life's story
This pledge to you
I bring
I'm
Yours In the gray
Of December
Here or on far distant shores
I've never loved anyone the way I love you
How could I?
When I was born
To be only
Yours?
 
Some folks want mansions, and some want gold
Others seek wisdom and fame untold
And some want something they can’t explain
As they climb the ladder of love

The ladder of love is not easy to climb
The things we want most seem the hardest to find

Some want a little and some a lot
Some are happy with what they’ve got
But I want someone here by my side
As I climb the ladder of love

(Some want little and some a lot)
(Some folks are happy with what they’ve got)
But I want someone here by my side
As I climb the ladder of love
As I climb the ladder (Ooo) of love
 
You must remember this:
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental
Things apply
As time goes by (as time goes by)
(As time goes by)

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that, you can rely
No matter what
The future brings
As time goes by (as time goes by)

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his maid
That, no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
As time goes
By (goes by)
(goes by)
(goes by)
 
It seemed we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling, you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened
For thе first time
Seem to be happening again

Thеn, so it seems
We've met before
And loved before
And loved before
But who knows where or when?
Where or when?
