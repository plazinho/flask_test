I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said, son

(Papa was a rolling stone)
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone)
(Papa was a rolling stone) my son, yeah
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone)
Well, well

Hey momma
Is it true what they say that papa never worked a day, in his life
And momma, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
I heard them talking papa doing some store front preachin'
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Momma just hung her head and said
(Papa was a rolling stone) my son
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone) hey
(Papa was a rolling stone) dadgummit
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone)
Uhh!

Hey momma
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey momma
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

(Papa was a rolling stone) well well well well
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) hey yeah huh
(And when he died) all he left us was alone lone lone lone alone
(Papa was a rolling stone) huh huh huh huh huh huh
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) hey yeah
(And when he died) all he left us was alone
I say yeah
(Papa was a rolling stone) yes he was
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) huh huh huh
(And when he died) all he left us was alone

‘Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
In my mind, I want you to be free
For all of our friends
To listen to me
Now hear what I say
We wish you a Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
To each one of you (To all of you)
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep, sleep in heaven, heavenly peace
Go on and rest your mind
And sleep, sleep, in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born, oh yes
Christ (Christ), Christ the Savior is born
What a joyous day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Silent night (As I sit around by the fireplace)
Holy night (Watching the gleaming tree)
All is calm (If I had one wish in this world)
All is bright (It would be that all men would be free)
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Oooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Ooh (Soon)
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I (I, I) can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Tell you, it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me"
Or I will surely die, hmm
(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

(Just my imagination) Once again
Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I’ve never met her but I can't forget her
(Just my imagination) Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runnin' away with me, ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
She's never hard to find (Just my imagination)
She's always on my mind (Runnin' away with me)6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you, I don't mind weepin'
If it'll keep you by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave (don't leave) me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!

People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learnin'
But the teacher

Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
Oh, yeah
That's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey

The sale of pills are at an all-time high
Young folks walkin' 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh, the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows

Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey

Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand, population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on

Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
It's a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey (Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya)

Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange

But I wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside (Such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying, ooh, eases the pain
Oh yeah, people, this hurt I feel inside, words could never explain

I just wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh, let it rain, rain, rain, rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh baby, let it rain (Let it rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the windowpane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying (Crying, crying, crying)
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside, my tears I refuse to explain
Oh I wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, let it rain, let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes (Rain, rain, rain, let it rain)
Oh, let it rain (Doo doo doo doo)

Oh yeah, yeah, listen (Let it rain, let it rain)
I'm a man and I got my pride (Rain, rain, rain, rain, let it rain)
'Til it rains I must be inside (Doo doo doo doo)

The childhood part of my life
It wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised
In the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept
Ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food
Or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease
My troubled mind
Mmm, listen
My father didn't know
The meaning of work
He disrespected Mama
And treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job
That I never did find
Depressed and downhearted
I took to Cloud Nine
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Folks down there tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance, son
Don't let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race
Where only the strongest survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world
And that ain't no lie
Listen, it ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night"
I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine
Let me tell you about Cloud Nine
(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine)
You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine)
And every man, every man is free
(Cloud Nine)
And you're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
Cloud Nine
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud Nine
I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high
(On Cloud Nine)
You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud Nine)
There's no difference between day and night
(Cloud Nine)
It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud Nine)
You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be

You ain't got no responsibility

It's a dream come alive
Heaven must have sent me
An angel of the night
'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul
You're my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole, oh, mmm

I always knew we end up together
Right from the very start
And I believe we'll make it forever
It's written right here in my heart
Oh yeah

You're my, you're my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole
Whoa whoa oh oh

I want a love I can see

Don't want a love you have to tell me about
That kind of a loving I can sure do without
(I can sure do without)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a love I can feel
That only kind of a loving I think is real
Don't wanna be quoted by something I heard now

Your love is fading, I can feel your love fading
Girl, it's fading away from me
Cause your touch, your touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurtin', downhearted and worried girl
Cause that face doesn't belong to me
Oh, it's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness inside
Ooh, I can tell I'm losing you
Ooh
I don't wanna lose you
Ooh, I can tell when we kiss
From the tenderness I miss
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
Girl, I can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be gone
Oh baby, I'm losing you
Oh my dear
What happened to the love we shared?
Oh baby, I'm losing you
I know it's true
There's someone new
Oh baby, baby, baby, I'm losing you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The sun is shining
There's plenty of light
A new day is dawning
Sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold
And the new day seems old

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)

The birds are singing
And the children are playing
There's plenty of work
And the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should
A young heart be saying
But fun is a bore
And with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Next time I'll be kinder
(Next time I'll be kinder)
Won't you please help me find her
(Won't you please help me find her)
Someone just remind her
(Someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her
(Of this love she left behind her)
'Til I find her I'll be trying
('Til I find her I'll be trying)
Every day I'm more inclined to find her
Inclined to find her
(Inclined to find my baby)
Been looking everywhere (Baby)
Baby, I really, really care

Oh, determination is fading fast (Oh yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past (Oh yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad
And what's happy is sad

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
I feel so bad (Since I lost my baby)
I feel so sad (Since I lost my baby)
Everything is wrong (Since I lost my baby)
This heart is hard to carry on (Since I lost my baby)
I'm lost as can be (Since I lost my baby)
What's gonna happen to me?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
