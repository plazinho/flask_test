In different states trynna come up now
Haters talking I don't hear a sound
Ain't nothing really that could get me down

I'm just trynna stack up money now
Ain't nothing really that could get me

Got a passion
And I made a vow

(Sky's Verse)
Run it up
Stack it up
Fuck it up
I just came in here to fuck it up
Never had shit when I was young
That's why I had come and fuck it up
Step on the stage and I fuck it up
Spend all my money on big ol blunts
Then I make it right back
I got that rubber band stack
I had to go and work for that
Never asking for a hand out
Gotta work with the cards dealt
Every move I had to figure out
All my checks getting bigger now
Been grindin since I left my momma house
There ain't nothing that can bring me down
All my dreams getting closer now
So I gotta go and run it up
So I gotta go and stack it up
So I gotta go and fuck it up
Fuck it up
Fuck it up
Fuck it up
So I gotta go and fuck it up
Fuck it up
Fuck it up
Fuck it up

Run it up, Stack it up, Fuck it up
Yeah!
Run it up, Stack it up, Fuck it up
Aye!
Run it up, Stack it up, Fuck it up
Run it up, Stack it up, Fuck it up
Woah!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
