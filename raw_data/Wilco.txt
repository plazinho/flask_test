Jesus, don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can combine anything you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

Don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can come by any time you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around
Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

Our love
Our love
Our love is all we have
Our love
Our love is all of God's money
Everyone is a burning sun

Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I am an American aquarium drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?

Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
This is not a joke, so please stop smiling
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt?

I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
Take it from the inside, baby hold on tight
You were so right when you said I've been drinking
What was I thinking when we said good night?

I want to hold you in the Bible-black predawn
You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
Take off your Band-Aid because I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when we said hello?

I'd always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in?
I am trying to break your heart
I am trying to break your heart
But still,​ I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
I am trying to break your heart

Disposable Dixie-cup drinking
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?

(... Loves you
I'm the man who loves you)16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine your teeth 'til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies

And whatever's going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
That's how you fight it

Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The cash machine is blue and green
For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee
I could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents
On Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes
I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck
How hot and sorrowful, this machine begs for luck

All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I want a good life with a nose for things
Fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering
A hole without a key if I break my tongue
Speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come?

All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache when I hear myself sing
All my lies are only wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I would like to salute
The ashes of American flags
And all the fallen leaves
Filling up shopping bags3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff
Shoulders shrugging off

Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with radio cures
Electronic surgical words

Picking apples for the kings and queens
Of things I've never seen
Oh, distance has no way
Of making love understandable

Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
There is something wrong with me
My mind is filled with silvery stars
Honey, kisses, clouds of fluff

Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
Wherever you go
Wherever you land
I'll say what this means to me
I'll do what I can
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
The fundamental problem
We all need to face
This is important
But I know you're not listening
Oh, I know you're not listening
If this was still new to me
I wouldn't understand
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
But this is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face
With no larger problems
That need to be erased
Nothing more important than to know
Someone's listening
Now I know
You'll be listening

You and I
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I
You and I

Me and you
What can we do
When the words we use sometimes
Are misconstrued
Well, I won't guess
What's coming next
I can't ever tell you
The deepest well I've ever fallen into

Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't need to know
Everything about you
Oh, I don't wanna know
And you don't need to know
That much about me
You and I
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I

It's my father's voice trailing off
Sailors sailing off in the morning
For the air-conditioned rooms
At the top of the stairs

His jaw's been broken
His bandage is wrapped too tight
His fangs have been pulled
And I really want to see you tonight

There's bourbon on the breath
Of the singer you love so much
He takes all his words from the books
That you don't read anyway

His jaw's been broken
His bandage is wrapped too tight
His fangs have been pulled
And I really want to see you tonight

Someone ties a bow
In my backyard to show me love
My voice is climbing walls
Smoking and I wanted love
My jaw's been broken
My heart is wrapped in ice
My fangs have been pulled
And I really want to see you tonight

And it makes no difference to me
How they cried all over overseas
When it's hot in the poor places tonight
I'm not going outside

They cried all over overseas
It makes no difference to me
When it's hot in the poor places tonight
I'm not going outside
("Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot")
It's hot in the poor places tonight

Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned

Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks are ringing in my ears

Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer

I've never been alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child
I was tied up like a boat
Unbuttoned like a coat
Set free for a while
Well I jumped to jolt my clumsy blood
While my white, green eyes
Cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?
I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain never fades
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
And I cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Over night?
So I won't ever want to touch
Your heart too much
Or hold you too tight
I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain will never fade
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
I never was alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I need a camera to my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I've counted out
The days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With echoes in my heart

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eye, deciding
Which lies have I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Where memories distort
Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

I've counted out
And no one knows how far
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
With echoes in my heart
(Tell 'em I'm lost)

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
Yeah, I'm lost
And no, it's not okay

No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I dreamed about killing you again last night
And it felt alright to me
Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies
I sat and watched you bleed
Buried you alive in a fireworks display
Raining down on me
Your cold, hot blood ran away from me
To the sea

I printed my name on the back of a leaf
And I watched it float away
The hope I had in a notebook full of white, dry pages
Was all I tried to save
But the wind blew me back via Chicago
In the middle of the night
And all without fight at the crush of veils and starlight

I know I'll make it back
One of these days and turn on your TV
To watch a man with a face like mine
Being chased down a busy street
When he gets caught, I won't get up
And I won't go to sleep
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Via Chicago

Where the cups are cracked and hooked
Above the sink, they make me think
Crumbling ladder, tears don't fall
They shine down your shoulders
And crawling is screw faster lash
And I blow it with kisses
I rest my head on a pillowy star
And a cracked door moon
That says I haven't gone too far


Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Via Chicago
I'm coming home
I'm coming homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
How can I convince you, it's me I don't like
And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes
When I've always been distant
And I've always told lies for love

I'm bound by these choices, so hard to make
I'm bound by the feeling, so easy to fake
None of this is real enough to take me from you

Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you

I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say
How can I get closer and be further away
From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie

Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you
Oh, I've got reservations
About so many things
But not about you

Not about you
Not about you
Not about you
It's not about you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page
I was meaning to send to you
I couldn’t tell if it’d bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you

But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you

All I can be is a busy sea
Of spinning wheels and hands that feel for
Stones to throw and feet that run but
Come back home
It made no difference
Ever known, it made no difference
Ever known to me

But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand
I’m the man who loves you
All I can see is black and white
And white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page
I was meaning to send to you
I couldn’t tell if it’d bring my heart

Writing this letter to you

But if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you’d understand

Crazy rides rockets
Where's your magic wand?
Empty out your pockets
Words without a song
I, myself, have found a real rival in myself
I am hoping for a re-arrival of my health

Sleeping eye sockets
Baby, suck your thumb
I'll keep you in my locket
A string I never strum
It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later

Lazy locomotives
Wherever you may roll
I think you have no motive
I know you have no home
It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself
Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later

Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught

Let's watch the miles flying by
You are not my typewriter
But you could be my demon
Moving forward through flaming doors

You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive

She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her
She says forever
To light a fuse
We could use
A hand full of wheel
And a day off
On a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real
When I forget how to talk I sing
Won't you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed
Just climb aboard
The tracks of a train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people underneath
Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes, you poor devil
Are there really ones like these
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you
I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Just climb aboard
The tracks of a train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me
She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit herEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing

Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon
Oh I'm bragging
I'm always in love

When I let go of your throat-sweet throttle
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model
Will I catch the moon, like a bird in a cage
It's for you I swoon
I'm always in love

I don't get the connection
This is only a test
I hope I do my best
You know I won't forget

When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
When I soak so long I forget my mother
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon
I'm bragging
I'm always in love

It's a drag I snag
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm always in loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The ashtray says
You were up all night
When you went to bed
With your darkest mind
Your pillow wept
And covered your eyes
And you finally slept
While the sun caught fire
You've changed

We fell in love
In the key of C
We walked along
Down by the sea
You followed me down
The neck to D
And fell again
Into the sea
You changed
Oh, you've changed

Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
The ashtray says
You were up all night
When you went to bed
With your darkest mind
You changed
Oh, you've changed

What you once were isn't what you want to be any more2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I try to stay busy
I do the dishes, I mow the lawn
I try to keep myself occupied
Even though I know you're not coming home
I try to keep the house nice and neat
I make my bed I change the sheets
I even learned how to use the washing machine
But keeping things clean doesn't change anything
What am I going to do when I run out of shirts to fold?
What am I going to do when I run out of lawn to mow?
What am I going to do if you never come home?
Tell me, what am I gonna do?

I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone

I caught myself thinking
I caught myself thinking once again
Have to try to keep my mind out of this
Try not to pretend
I'll check the phone
I'll check the mail
I'll check the phone again and I call your mom
She says you're not there and I should take care
I hate it here
When you're gone
I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone

I try to stay busy
I take out the trash, I sweep the floor
Try to keep myself occupied
Because I know you don't live here anymore4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
