Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do


Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

(Da-da-da, da-dum-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Da-dum-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da, da-dum-da-dum-da)
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24-hour shopping in rapture

Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinnin' I said, "My My"
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
France Soir c'est pas Flash et Nous Deux
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rap-ture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars, get up6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure?
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my

Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free

I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by - we just keep on dreaming

Feet feet, walking a two mile
Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him
Dream, dream, even for a little while
Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away, radiate
I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold just to have some

Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free

She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
You wanna make her all your own?

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights

I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and fool on fire
Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire
Don't you wanna make her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?

Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights

Ooh, don't you wanna break her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?

She walks like she don't care
You want to take her everywhere
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She's like a millionaire
Walking on imported air
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but, who cares?
Racing down the bowery, on a crowded afternoon
Dripping from the downpour of your insecure typhoon
Can you even want me, or this is just a way to keep you safe?

Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?

Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted, is this everything you had in store?

Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?
Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, i can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?

I've been running circles round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but, who cares?

Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend

Take me, then lose me, then tell them Im yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours

I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall
I know he's there, but I just had to call

Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

I heard your mother, now she's going out the door
Did she go to work or just go to the store?
All those things she said, I told you to ignore

Oh, why can't we talk again?
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Oh, why can't we talk again?

Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long
If I don't get your calls, then everything goes wrong
I want to tell you something you've known all along
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

I had to interrupt and stop this conversation
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection

Oh, I can't control myself
Oh, I can't control myself
Oh, I can't control myself

Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

Hang up and run to me (oh)
Hang up and run to me (oh)
Hang up and run to me (oh)

I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday Girl
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams, Sunday Girl
Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home, Sunday Girl
Ooh

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl
When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait
I got the blues, please, please
Please come see what'cha do to me

All I want is a room with a view
A sight worth seeing, a vision of you
All I want is a room with view, oh-oh
I will give you my finest hour
The one I spent watching you shower
I will give you my finest hour, oh yeah

All I want is a photo in my wallet
A small remembrance of something more solid
All I want is a picture of you

Picture this - a day in December
Picture this - freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids
If it weren't for your job at the garage
If you could only oh-oh
Picture this - a sky full of thunder
Picture this - my telephone number
One and one is what I'm telling you, oh yeah

All I want is 20-20 vision
A total portrait with no omissions
All I want is a vision of you, oh-oh
If you can picture this - a day in December
Picture this - freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids
If it weren't for your job at the garage
If you could only oh-oh

I saw you standing on the corner, you looked so big and fine
I really wanted to go out with you, so when you smiled
I laid my heart on the line

You read me my rights and then you said
"Let's go" and nothing more
I thought of my nights, and how they were
They were filled with

I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh

We sat in the night with my hands cuffed at my side
I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more

I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh
Walking the line, you were a marksman
Told me that law, like wine, is ageless
Public defender
You had to admit
You wanted the love of a sex offender

I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh

My vision in blue, I call you from inside my cell
And in the trial, you were there
With your badge and rubber boots

I think all the time how I'm going to
Perpetrate love with you
And when I get out, there's no doubt
I'll be sex offensive to you

Hey, psst-psst, here she comes now

Oh, you know her
Would you look at that hair?
Yeah, you know her
Check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebody's blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks she's Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar

Ew, she's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds

Oh, you know her, "Miss Groupie Supreme"
Yeah, you know her, "Vera Vogue" on parade
Red eye shadow, green mascara
Bleh, she's too much
She looks like she don't know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen
Yeah, she's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds

She got the nerve to tell me she's not on it
But her expression is too serene
Yeah, she looks like she washes with Comet
Always looking to create a scene

Yeah, she's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull
Rip her to shreds

Oh, you know her, "Miss Groupie Supreme"

Sidewalk social scientist don't get no satisfaction from your cigarette
It's ten to ten and time is running out
Lock up all your memories, get out of here, you know that we can run

Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
It's 11:59, and I want to stay alive

Pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night
Take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean
Wait until the morning, take tomorrow by the hand
Take it down the highway like a rocket to the ocean, we can run

Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
It's 11:59, and I want to stay alive

Hanging on a frequency and burning like a fire
Boy you've got the motion down, it's getting late, I'm tired and I've lost control
Don't leave me here, time is running out

You can't create more time, you just make it
If you want a new life, just take it
And if you wanna change the world then speak real clear
And make sure someone's listening, listening
And if you wanna break my heart then stay right here
Yeah, don't go anywhere

Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?

Everything comes in pieces

Do you love me yet? Fucking prove it
Try to ask yourself; are you really different?
Know that your life is more frightening than writing a song
It's an action of fractions you're passing along
And these oceans of emotion will crash once they hit the shore, I promise you
And it's the closest I will get to sincerity
The praise I make just looks so fake and cruel to me
And it's the closest I will come to purity
Simulations never follow me
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?

My heart is made up of pieces

Do you get it yet? Can you see through this?
You know all too well you cannot make things perfect
No, I'll be shifting through lists of these possible loves
With this pain in my brain it feels scattered like doves
Through this sky where my eyes have been drifting towards recently
And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak up behind and tear at me
And it'll slam me to the ground into reality
And I'll deal with my disparity

Oh, do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
This is where I fall down, shattered on the floor
As I'm swept along with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget
The truth, the truth, oh, the truth, the truth...
