To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep

To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together

To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracing


To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time for love, a time for hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late
 
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' you
Take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Unto my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
 
Eight miles high, and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street, that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own
Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town, known for its sound
In places, small faces unbound
Round the squares, huddled in storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes, and black limousines
Some living, some standing alone
 
Sun warm on my face, I hear you
Down below moving slow
And it's morning
Take my time this morning, no hurry
To learn to kill and take the will
From unknown faces
Today was the day for action
Leave my bed to kill instead
Why should it happen?
 
Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair
I don't care
How many letters they send
Morning came and morning went
Pack up your money
Pick up your tent
You ain't goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair
Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To a tree with roots
You ain't goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair
Now Genghis Kahn
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it
Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair
 
Oh I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no one knows the names of
And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside a legendary fountain
'Til I see your form reflected
In its clear and jeweled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another
I will want to dive beneath
The white cascading waters
She may beg, she may plead
She may argue with her logic
And mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
In the end she will surely know
I wasn't born to follow
 
Crimson flames tied through my years
Flowing high and mighty trapped
Countless fire and flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges soon", said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate", I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
Sisters fled by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now


Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
 
I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more electric trains
No more trees to climb
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
But every day can be
A magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

La la la la la

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
But every day can be
A magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

La la la la
 
The reasons why, oh, I can't say
I have to let you go, babe, and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone

Baby, for a long time, you had me believe
That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know, that you were putting me on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone

Now I've got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games anymore
After what you did, I can't stay on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
 
Oh how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention
All my two dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working
And as I continued to drop through the hole
I found all the surrounding
To show me the joy that innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you
And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teacher's had made
Scientific delirium madness
I will keep falling as long as I live
All without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning
Oh how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention
 
Woke up this morning with light in my eyes
And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light comin' down from the sky
I don't know who or why
Must be those strangers that come every night
Whose saucers shaped lights put people up tight
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark
I hope they get home all right
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride
Woke up this mornin', I was feeling quite weird
Had flies in my beard, my toothpaste was smeared
Over my window, they'd written my name
Said: "So long, we'll see you again"
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride
 
So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star?
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time and learn how to play
And with your hair swung right
And your pants too tight
It's gonna be alright

Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plasticware
And in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

The price you paid for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game?
You're a little insane
The money, the game and the public acclaim
Don't forget what you are
You're a rock 'n' roll star

La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
 
Always alone never with a herd
Prettiest mare I’ve ever seen
You’ll have to take my word
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I’ll give her my brand
Well I was up on stony ridge after this chestnut mare
I’d been chasin’ her for weeks
Oh, I’d catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
Takin’ her meal, or bathin'
A fine lady
This one day I happened to be real close to her
And I saw her standin’ over there
So I snuck up on her nice and easy
Got my rope out
And I flung it in the air
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I’ll give her my brand
And we’ll be friends for life
She’ll be just like a wife
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
Well I got her, and I’m pullin’ on her, and she’s pullin’ back
Like this mule goin’ up a ladder
And I take a choice and I jump up on her
Damned if I don’t land right on top of her
And she takes off, runnin’ up on to the ridge
Higher than I’ve ever been before
She’s runnin’ along just fine, 'til she stops
And something spooked her
It’s a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
She doesn’t know what to do for a second
But then she jumps off the edge
Me holding on
Above the hills
Higher than eagles were gliding
Suspended in the sky
Over the moon
Straight for the sun we were riding
My eyes were filled with light
Behind us black walls
Below us a bottomless canyon
Floating with no sound
Gulls far below
Seemed to be suddenly rising
Exploding all around
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I’ll give her my brand
And we’ll be friends for life
She’ll be just like a wife
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
And we were falling down this crevice
About a mile down I’d say
I look down and I see this red thing below us
Comin’ up real fast
And it’s our reflection in a little pool of water
About six feet wide, and one foot deep
And we're crawling down right through it
We hit and we splashed it dry
That’s when I lost my hold and she got away
But I’m going to try to get her again some day
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I’ll give her my brand
And we’ll be friends for life
She’ll be just like a wife
I’m going to catch that horse
I’m going to catch that horse
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
I’m going to catch that horse if I can
 
The jukebox is playin' a honky-tonk song
"One more", I keep sayin', "and then I'll go home"
What good will it do me, I know what I'll find
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
The people are dancin' and havin' their fun
And I sit here thinkin' about what you have done
To try and forget you, I've turned to the wine
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
Alone and forsaken, so blue I could cry
I just sit here drinkin' till the bottle runs dry
What good will it do me, I know what I'll find
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
An empty bottle, a broken heart and you're still on my mind
 
My buddies tell me that I should've waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I still love them, and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life


My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
I live without them and walk in the light
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
I like the Christian life
 
Everybody has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Anyone in this place can tell you to your face
Why you shouldn't try to love someone

Everybody knows it never works
Everybody knows and me
I know that door that shuts just before
You get to the dream you see

I know all too well how to turn, how to run
How to hide behind a bitter wall of blue
But you die inside if you choose to hide
So I guess instead I'll love you
 
He's a drug store truck drivin man
He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town
Well he's got him a house on the hill
He plays country records till you've had your fill
He's a fireman's friend, he's an all night DJ
But he sure does think different from the records he plays
He's a drug store truck drivin man
He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town
Well he don't like the young folks I know
He told me one night on his radio show
He's got him a medal he won in the war
Weighs five hundred pounds and sleeps on his floor
He's a drug store truck drivin man
He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town
He's been like a father to me
He's the only DJ you can hear after three
I'm an all night musician in a rock 'n' roll band
And why he don't like me, I can't understand
He's a drug store truck drivin man
He's a head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town
 
One hundred years from this day will the people still feel this way
Still say the things that they're saying right now
Everyone said I'd hurt you, they said that I'd desert you
If I go away, you know I'm gonna get back some how
Nobody knows what kind of trouble we're in
Nobody seems to think it'll all might happen again
One hundred years from this time would anybody change their minds
And find out one thing or two about life
But people are always talking
You know they're always talking
Everybody's so wrong that I know it's gonna work out right
Nobody knows what kind of trouble we're in
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again
 
You want to know how it will be
Me and her, or you and me
You both stand there, your long hair flowing
Your eyes alive, your mind still growing
Saying to me what can we do now that we both love you
I love you too
And I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
You are afraid, embarrassed too
No one has ever said such a thing to you
Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulders
A face like ice, a little bit colder
Saying to you, you cannot do that
It breaks all the rules, you learned in school
But I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
We love each other, it's plain to see
There's just one answer that comes to be
Sister lovers, water brothers, and in time maybe others
So you see what we can do is to try something new
If you're crazy too
And I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
 
Oh what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future?
Say the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner?
Say the black bells of Rhondda
And who killed the miner?
Say the grim bells of Blaina
Throw the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport
All will be well if, if, if, if, if
Say the green bells of Cardiff
Why so worried sisters? Why?
Sang the silver bells of Wye
And what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Oh what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future?
Say the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner?
Say the black bells of Rhondda
And who killed the miner?
Say the grim bells of Blaina
