I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried


Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
And I'm a believer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm a believer
 
Chip: 7A
Davy: What number is this, Chip?
Other 3 Monkees: 7-A!
Davy: OK!, know what I mean, like don't get excited man. It's 'cos I'm short, I know

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times starts and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen


Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
 
Me and Magdalena
We're driving south through Monterey
As the sun is slowly sinking
Into a distant ocean wave

And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Tell me Magdalena
What do you see in the depths of your night?
Do you see a long lost father?
Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child?

But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under

Me and Magdalena
Always leaving early and sleeping late
Secluded in the canyon
Lost within a turn of fate

But know everything lost will be recovered
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she's under
 
{Intro}
She's a wonderful lady
And she's mine, all mine
And there doesn't seem a way
That she won't come and lose my mind
It's too easy humming songs
To a girl in a yellow dress
It's been a long time since the party
And the room is in a mess
The four kings of EMI are sitting stately on the floor
There are birds out on the sidewalk
And a valet at the door
He reminds me of a penguin
With few and plastered hair
There's talcum powder on the letter
And the birthday boy is there
Why don't you cut your hair?
Why don't you live up there?
Why don't you do what I do
See what I feel when I care?
Now they've darkened all the windows
And the seats are naugahide
I've been waiting for an hour
I can't find a place to hide
The being known as wondergirl
Is speaking, I believe
It's not easy trying to tell her
That I shortly have to leave
Why don't you be like me?
Why don't you stop and see?
Why don't you hate who I hate
Kill who I kill to be free?
{Vocal Bridge}
Why don't you cut your hair?
Why don't you live up there?
Why don't you do what I do
See what I feel when I care?
Why don't you be like me? (She's a wonderful lady)
Why don't you stop and see? (And she's mine, all mine)
Why don't you hate who I hate, (And there doesn't seem a way)
Kill who I kill to be free? (That she won't come and lose my mind)
Why don't you cut your hair? (It's too easy humming songs)
Why don't you live up there? (To a girl in a yellow dress)
Why don't you do what I do, (It's been a long time since the party)
See what I feel when I care? (And the room is in a mess)

Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
Cause I made your reservation
Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again
We'll have one more night together
Till the morning brings my train and I must go
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Take the last train to Clarksville
I'll be waiting at the station
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses
And a bit of conversation, oh
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
{bridge}
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Take the last train to Clarksville
Now I must hang up the phone
I can't hear you in this noisy railroad station all alone
I'm feeling low
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Ohhh
Ahhhhhhh
Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
Cause I made your reservation
Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Take the last train to Clarksville (repeat and fade)
 
Here we come, walkin'
Down the street
We get the funniest looks from
Ev'ry one we meet
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
We go wherever we want to
Do what we like to do
We don't have time to get restless
There's always something new
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
We're just tryin' to be friendly
Come and watch us sing and play
We're the young generation
And we've got something to say
Any time, Or anywhere
Just look over your shoulder
Guess who'll be standing there
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
And people say we monkey around
But we're too busy singing
To put anybody down
We're just tryin' to be friendly
Come and watch us sing and play
We're the young generation
And we've got something to say
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
You never know where we'll be found
So you'd better get ready
We may be comin' to your town
 
Sock it to me...
Floatin' down the river
With a saturated liver
And I wish I could forgive her
But I do believe she meant it
When she told me to forget it
And I bet she will regret it
When they find me in the morning wet and drowned
And the word gets 'round
Goin' down
Goin' down
Coming' up for air
It's pretty stuffy under there
I'd like to say I didn't care
But I forgot to leave a note
And it's so hard to stay afloat
I'm soakin' wet without a boat
And I knew I should have taken off my shoes
It's front page news
Goin' down
Goin' down
I wish I had another drink
It wouldn't be so hard to sink
I should have taken time to think
Besides I got the picture straight
She must have had another date
I didn't need this extra weight
I wish that I could see the way to shore
Don't want no more
Goin' down
I'm goin' down
And now I see the life I led
I slept it all away in bed
I should have learned to swim instead
And now it's really got me stumped
I can't believe why I jumped
I'd like to get my tummy pumped
I can't believe they drink this stuff in town
This dirty brown
Goin' down
Goin' down
I wish I looked before I leaped
I didn't know it was so deep
Been down so far I don't get wet
Haven't touched the bottom yet
This river scene is gettin' old
I'm hungry, sleepy, wet and cold
She told me to forget it. Nice
I should have taken her advice
I only want to go on home
I'd gladly leave that girl alone
What a way to spend the night
If I don't drown, I'll die of fright
My pappy taught me how to float
But I can't swim a single note
He threw me in to teach me how
I stayed there floatin' like a mama cow
And now I've floated way down stream
I know this has to be a dream
If I could find my way to shore
I'd never, never do this anymore
They give you three, I've been down nine
I'm goin' down just one more time
Goin' down
Goin' down
Now the sky is gettin' light
An everything will be alright
Think I finally got the knack
Just floatin' here lazy on my back
I never really liked that town
I think I'll ride the river down
Just movin' slow and floatin' free
There's a river swingin' under me
Waving back to the folks on shore
I should have thought of this before
I'm floatin' on down to New Orleans
Goin' to pick up on some swingin' scenes
I know I'll know a better day
I'll go down groovin' all the way
Goin' down
Goin' down
 
The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn this song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care

See Mrs. Gray she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand

Creature comfort goals
They only numb my soul
And make it hard for me to see
My thoughts all seem to stray
To places far away
I need a change of scenery

Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta
Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta (Ahh)
Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta
Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta (Ahh)

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Charcoal burnin’ everywhere
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
 
I can tell by your face
That you're looking to find a place
To settle your mind
And reveal who you are
And you shouldn't be shy
For I'm not gonna try
To hurt you, or heal you, or steal your star

Open your eyes
Get up off your chair
There's so much to do in the sunlight
Give up your secrets
And let down your hair
And sit with me here by the firelight

Why think all about
Who's gonna win out?
We'll make up our story as we go along
There's so little time
For us to try to rhyme
And so many highways to travel upon

Open your eyes
Get up off your chair
There's so much to do in the sunlight
Give up your secrets
And let down your hair
And sit with me here by the firelight
 
I, I, I, I, I'm not your steppin' stone
I, I, I, I, I'm not your steppin' stone
You're tryin' to make your mark in society
You're usin' all the tricks that you used on me
You're readin' all them high-fashion magazines
The clothes you're wearin', girl, are causin' public scenes
I said I, I, I, I, I'm not your steppin' stone
I, I, I, I, I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
When I first met you girl you didn't have no shoes
But now you're walkin' 'round like you're front page news
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But you won't find my name in your book of Who's Who
I said I, I, I, I, I'm not your steppin' stone (no girl, not me)
I, I, I, I, I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone...
 
You know my girl⁠—

You know my girl just called me up
And she woke me from my sleep
You should have heard the things she said
You know, she hurt my feelings deep
I'm gonna buy me a dog



'Cause I need a friend now

I'm gonna buy me a dog
My girl, my girl, no love me no how


She used to bring me my
My newspapers

'Cause she knew where it was at
She used to keep me so contented
But I can teach a dog to do that!
I'm gonna buy me a dog

'Cause I need a friend now (I need a friend now)
Now (Yeah)
I'm gonna buy me a dog

My girl, my girl, no love me no how












I'm gonna buy me a dog (Dog!)
A dog, hmm (Yeah!)
'Cause I need a friend now (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, boop-boop-sh-bop-bop ram-a-lama
I'm gonna buy me a dog

When my girl
My girl don't love me no how
How
 
I'll love you this year, I'll love you next year, and then forever
I'll always need you, I'll never leave you, I'll love you forever
And if you ever change your mind, think again, and give me time
You're my first love, you are my last love, you're my forever
I love this feeling, my heart is beating a mile a minute
No other woman has ever been so deep inside in it
And when the sun shines on our love, that's when I thank the Lord above
You're my first love, you are my last love, you're my beginning
And when the sun shines on our love, that's when I thank the Lord above
You're my first love, you are my last love, you are my everlasting love
You are my first love, you are my last love, you're my forever
 
Look out, here comes tomorrow
That's when I'll have to choose
How I wish I could borrow
Someone else's shoes

Mary (Mary, oh)
Oh, what a sweet girl
Lips like (Berry pie)
Strawberry pie
Sandra (Sandra, oh)
Long hair and big girl
Can't make up my mind

I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come

Told them (Told them both)
Both that I loved them
Said it (Yes, I did)
And it was true
But I (But I can't)
Can't have both of them
Don't know what to do

I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come

Mary, I love you
Sandra, I love you

Well, I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come, ooh

I love you
Darling
I love you
 
When the world and I were young
Just yesterday
Life was such a simple game
A child could play
It was easy then to tell right from wrong
Easy then to tell weak from strong
When a man should stand and fight
Or just go along
But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray
I remember when the answers seemed so clear
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear
It was easy then to tell truth from lies
Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate
The foolish from the wise
But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray
It was easy then to know what was fair
When to keep and when to share
How much to protect your heart
And how much to care
But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray
Only shades of gray
 
One, two, three, four, five
Four, three, two, one, zero
Ah-ah

Reasoned verse, some prose or rhyme
Loses themselves in other times
And waiting hopes cast silent spells
That speak in clouded clues
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you

Careful plays on fields
That seem to vanish
When they're in between
And softly as I walk away
In freshly tattered shoes
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you
Na-na-na

Sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

Silhouettes and figures stay
Close to what he had to say
And one more time, the faded dream
Is saddened by the news
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you

Well, sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

Sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

Silhouettes and figures stay
Close to what he had to say
And one more time the faded dream
Is saddened by the news
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you
 
Love is understanding
Don't you know that this is true
Love is understanding
It's in everything we do
In this generation
In this lovin' time
In this generation
We will make the world shine
We were born to love one another
This is something we all need
We were born to love one another
We must be what we're goin' to be
And what we have to be is free
In this generation
In this lovin' time
In this generation
We will make the world shine
We were born to love one another
This is something we all need
We were born to love one another
We must be what we're goin' to be
And what we have to be is free
Love is understanding, we gotta be free
Love is understanding, we gotta be free
 
Girl, don't you know everytime I see you smilin'?
Hurts so bad 'cause when I see you, I start trying
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying
Falling in love with you girl is just like dying

Oh, don't walk away
Oh, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away
I can still hear you saying those

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Girl don't you know we can work it out with talkin'?
You won't turn around or slow down your walking
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it
You had to get your kicks outta tryin' to steal it

Now I'm standing here
Strange, strange voices in my ears
I feel the tears
But all I can hear are those

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Oh, I'm standing here
Strange, strange voices in my ears
I feel the tears
But all I can hear are those

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Words that never were true
Spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside
But small enough to hide
'Til your playin' was through

Words that never were true
Just spoken to help nobody but you
 
My, my, the clock in the sky
Is pounding away
There's so much to say
A face, a voice
An overdub has no choice
An image cannot rejoice

Wanting to be
To hear and to see
Crying to the sky
But the porpoise is laughing
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Clicks, clacks
Riding the backs of giraffes
For laughs is alright for a while
The ego sings
Of castles and kings and things
That go with a life of style

Wanting to feel
To know what is real
Living is a lie
The porpoise is waiting
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
 
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary, can I go too
This one thing I will vow ya
I'd rather die than to live without ya

Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary, tell me truly
What did I do to make you leave me?
Whatever it was I didn't mean to
You know I never would try and hurt ya
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?

What more, Mary, can I do
To prove my love is truly yours?
I've done more now than a clear-thinkin' man would do

Mary, Mary, it's not over
Where you go, I will follow
'Til I win your love again
And walk beside you, but until then
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?

Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
Aw, Mary, where you goin' to?
Mary, Mary
Mary, where you goin' to?
