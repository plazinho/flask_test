Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

So happy together
How is the weather?
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
Happy together
So happy together
So happy together (ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba)
 
You've got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you, Elenore, near me
Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you, Elenore, really

Elenore, gee, I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy, et cetera
Elenore, can I take the time
To ask you to speak your mind?
Tell me that you love me better

I really think you're groovy
Let's go out to a movie
Whadda you say now, Elenore, can we?
They'll turn the lights way down low
Maybe we won't watch the show
I think I love you, Elenore, love me

Elenore, gee, I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy, et cetera
Elenore, can I take the time
To ask you to speak your mind?
Tell me that you love me better

(One more time)
Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, ha-ha
Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, ha-ha, ha-ah-ah

Some girls love to run around

She don't fly although she can

Mornin', mornin' glory
If you'd like to know where was I last night
Well, I saw a girl with a boy in her eye
And she's so outta sight

She's my girl
And that's where I was last night
Off in a dream

She's my girl
I took her away last night
Went for a ride
Off in the sky, that's where I was last night

I just come back to tell ya
There's a little bit of Heaven underneath the apple tree
And every time I see you with that smile upon your face
There's a little bit there for me

And she's my girl
And that's where I was last night
Went for a ride

She's my girl
I took her away last night
We went for a ride
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Off in the sky

She's my girl
I took her away last night
Off in the sky
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Gettin' so high

Off in the sky, that's where I was last night

My girl
I took her away last night
We went for a ride
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Gettin' so high

My girl
I took her away last night
Off in the sky
My girl
And that's where I was last night
Gettin' so high
 
From the time I fall asleep
'Til the mornin' comes I dream about
You, baby
And I feel alright
'Cause I know tonight I'll be with
You, baby
And who makes me feel like smilin'
When the weary day is through?
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
They say candy is sweet
But it just can't compete with
You, baby
You've got everything I need
And nobody can please like
You do, baby
And who believes all my wildest dreams
And my craziest schemes will come true?
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
A little ray of sunshine
A little bit of soul
Add just a touch of magic
You got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)
 
No wonder why I feel so bored
Each day's like the one before
I think I'll run away
And climb higher than I've climbed before
Life should show me so much more
I think I'll run away
And you can come (And we'll be calm)
We'll run away (Together run)
Things will be so (Much better, run)
Live as we die
High, high on some green hill we'll be
Laughing at reality
Glad we ran away
Climb higher than we've climbed before
Life should show us so much more
I think I'll run away
(I think I'll run away)
(I think I'll run away)
(I think I'll run away, ooh)
 
Bacon fried, squinty-eyed, moments of the dawn
Misty street callin' me, "Get dressed and walk around"
In the square, standing there girl so sad
"What's the matter"?
She said
"Oh, oh dear sir, the world has got me down
And folks preach happiness when there's none to be found
I type and answer phones to earn my meager pay
To keep me alive so I can waste another day"
I sadly turned and walked away
For there was nothing I could say
Walking on, noonday sun, dusty road to town
Saddened by the girl that I had chanced to come upon
Then, I'd seen a limousine
A rich old guy, mean of eye
He said
"Oh, bah humbug, you can't understand
The world is one big bank, you must steal what you can
Because it's fools like you who waste their precious time
By walking in the sun instead of trying to make a dime"
The words he spoke turned my world grey
Could everybody feel this way?
As if in answer down the road
A lovely girl picked flowers of gold
She smiled sweetly and gave one to me
And said
"Please, kind sir, don't look so down
For in this hard world (OK) love still abounds
And hand in hand friends of beauty can lie
On clover beds 'neath a blanket of sky"
Oh, oh dear sir, the world has got me down
(Oh, bah humbug, you can't understand)
And folks preach happiness when there's none to be found
(The world is one big bank, you must steal what you can)
I type and answer phones to earn my meager pay
(Because it's fools like you who waste their precious time)
To keep me alive so I can waste another day
(By walking in the sun instead of trying to make a dime)
"How are you? How are you? How are you?"
"Hi, how are you?"
 
Shouldn't we two be together?
You know what I mean
To be with you is something like a dream (You know what I mean)
And if you want me to
I'll bring sunshine to you only
You better stop, take a look about
You know what I mean
If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me
Then you'd know the reason why
I would love to say "I do" than say
"Goodbye" and let you go forever
Wouldn't we two be together?
Can't you see that I want you (Why can't you see?)
For me forever
Wouldn't we two be together?
Do you know what I mean? Can't you read in between the lines?
Sometimes I'm talking and it doesn't seem too clear
But, if you have to know (But if you have to know)
I'm in love with only you know what I mean (I'm in love)
Do you know what I mean? (Know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Know what I mean?)
 
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
A-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Well it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only lead you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more

But it ain't me, babe
A-no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Well, it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
No, it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I said no, no, no, it ain't me, babe
 
The eastern world, it is explodin'
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'
You don't believe in war but what's that gun you're totin'?
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say?
And can't you feel the fears that I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy

And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Think of all the hate there is in Red China
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
You may leave here for four days in space
But when your return it's the same old place
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor but don't forget to say grace

And tell me over and over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Ah, no, no you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

I have learned
That love can turn
Like the seasons
And I know
You had to go
You've got your reasons
Still, I wish you'd stay
Tell me why you're going away
It hurts me not knowing
And I believe
That love's like leaves
In September
But Fall
And all
I do is remember
Still, I wish you'd stay
Tell me why you're going away
It hurts me not knowing
How I have wronged you
Oh, how I long to hold you again
Like summer never ended
But winter must fall
And I will give all
Of my love to someone new
For summer must follow too
And you and I have learned
That love can turn
Like the seasons
And I know
You had to go
You've got your reasons
Still, I wish you'd stay
 
And this is but an island in an ocean
This is our home, third from the sun
Let it be ever green
Let it be ever green
And this is but an island in an ocean
This is our home, third from the sun
God, keep it ever green
To keep it ever green I would lay my life down
And this is but an island in an ocean
 
Perhaps another time or maybe another place
Could've eased my mind, would've never seen your face
Or heard about you
But now you call my name and you're reality
Though it's hard to explain, I know I'll never be
Without you
I know nothing about you
But I know I don't doubt your love and I know that it's real
By God above I know how I feel
About you
Got a handful of gold and a pocketful of dreams
But a heart full of love and I know what it means
To be without you
Please sit by my side and share with me
All the feelings inside and the things that you see
About you
I'd always known you'd be here today
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so you'll hear me say
That for all my life I will always stay
About you
I'd always known you'd be here today
Waiting for me; now the time is right, so you'll hear me say
That for all my life I will always stay
About you
About you
About you
About you
(About you)
(About you)
(About you)
(About you)
(About you)
(About you)
(About you)
 
Everybody says "Be strong" but I just can't take it
Every time I look at you, I feel funny inside, yeah
I've been meaning to ask you this for such a long, long time
Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?
I know that you think of me as just a friend
But you don't know how friendly I can be, yeah
I want so much to prove my love, baby, give me half a chance
Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?
Now I don't think I can go another day without you
And one little kiss will tell me what I wanna know 'bout you
It ain't gonna hurt you, come on, baby
Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?
Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?
 
The cold clean air, it sets my boot heels on fire
But if I told you I've forgotten my past, I'd be a motherless liar
A woman of the street, a woman of the world
A hell-made model of the devil's girl
I'm gonna hold my head up high and take a walk in the sun
Well, she gave her heart to so many that shattered my world
Ah, but a man can't ruin his life for the love of a girl
I'm gonna throw away my crutches, gonna run in the rain
Gonna let my nostrils swell with the nature of the plains
I'm gonna hold my head up high and take a walk in the sun
Well, she loved so many men, my heart was breakin'
With every little kiss, well I'd be achin'
Yet whatever I've be given to be taken
Ah, but a man can't live when the story begins, begins to slip away
I'm gonna walk right down that road and never return
And not until these fires inside me are startin' to burn
'Cause I don't need a gal beside me or a gal to keep me warm
Or a gal that I can talk to 'til the early hours of morn'
I'm gonna hold my head up high and take a walk in the sun
Well, I'm gonna walk on down that road and never return
And not until these fires inside me are startin' to burn
'Cause I don't need a gal beside me or a gal to keep me warm
Or a gal that I can talk to 'til the early hours of morn'
I'm gonna hold my head up high and take a walk in the sun
I'm gonna hold my head up high and take a walk in the sun

Listen we're gonna take five now
Pause for the cause
We'll be right back
And then sign a record with Howie, Mark, John, Jim and Al
Sockin' it to ya)
 
While you sit and seek
A crescent moon is laying at your feet
With hope that's made of sand
You don't think you can
But you've held it all in your hands
I've been tryin' hard to keep
From needing you but from the start
My heart just rolled and flowed
I've seen where it goes
Still somehow my love for you grows, Lady-O
So on my heels I'll grow wings
Gonna ride silver strings
But I'll see you in my holiest dreams, Lady-O
So on my heels I'll grow wings (Ooh, la, la, la, la-la-la)
Gonna ride silver strings (La, la, la, la, la-la-la)
But I'll see you in my holiest dreams, Lady-O
I've been tryin' hard to keep
From needing you but from the start
My heart just rolled and flowed
I've seen where it goes
Still somehow my love for you grows, Lady-O
