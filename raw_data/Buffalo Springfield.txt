There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A-telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Are gettin' so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

What a field day for the heat (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
A thousand people in the street (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Singing songs and a-carryin' signs (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

It's time we stopped
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life, it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
 
Oh, hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head
Is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face
Could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world
Could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange
But don't change" and I let her

In a while will the smile on my face
Turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick
Does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face
Is moving much faster

Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange, I should change?
I don't know, why don't you...
 
There you stood on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowing that you'd gone
By the summer it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I found
Knowing it was gone
If I ever lived without you
Now you know I died
If I ever said I loved you
Now you know I tried
Babe, now you know I tried
Babe, now you know I tried
Babe
 
Listen to my bluebird laugh
She can't tell you why
Deep within her heart, you see
She knows only crying, just crying

There she sits, aloft a perch
Strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now
Thinks only of you, just you, oh yeah

So get all those blues
Must be a thousand hues
And be just differently used
You just know

You sit there mesmerized
By the depth of her eyes
That you can't categorize
She got soul, she got soul
She got soul, she got soul

Do you think she loves you?
Do you think at all?


Soon she's going to fly away
Sadness is her own
Give herself a bath of tears
And go home, and go home
 
The lights turned on and the curtain fell down
And when it was over, it felt like a dream
They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream
The agents had paid for the black limousine
That waited outside in the rain
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?
Eighteen years of American dream
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall
His mother had told him a trip was a fall
And don't mention babies at all
Did you see him, did you see him?
Did you see him in the river?
He was there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?
The streets were lined for the wedding parade
The queen wore the white gloves, the county of song
The black-covered caisson her horses had drawn
Protected her king from the sun rays of dawn
They married for peace and were gone
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?
 
When the dream came I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now, I won't be back till later on if I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now
In a strange game, I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same, you can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?
Though we rush ahead to save our time, we are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now?
 
Got a good reason for loving you
It's an old-fashioned sign
I kinda get the feeling like, mmm, you know when
I fell in love the first time
Kind woman, won't you love me tonight
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right
Remember once before, you're hearing the old folks say
Love's an ageless, old rhyme
Now-a-days, you know they're saying "Depends so much on
The kind of woman that you find"
Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Are you saying it's all right?
Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes
Kind woman, don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right
 
There's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock n' roll, she's a joy to know
'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand
And she will follow me wide, do you know
Familiar places she's been by, that I know
Could it be, she don't have to try
And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to find
 
Is my world not falling down
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I miss you
Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I miss you
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a kid
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home
City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I miss you
 
Sit down I think I love you
Anyway I'd like to try
I can't stop thinking of you
If you go I'll know I cry
Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I get high just being around
You oughta know what they say about the bird in the hand
And that's why I ain't leaving without you
So if you want someone to love you
Pretty baby I'm your guy
It's not much I'm asking of you
Just to please give me a try
Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I get high just being around
You know what they say about the bird in my hand
And that's why I ain't leaving without you
So if you want someone to love you
Pretty baby I'm your guy
It's not much I'm asking of you
Just to please give me a try
Sit down I think I love you x4
 
Where are we going, love?
What are you feelin'?
Now that I've caught my love
My head is reelin'

With the questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Come on lover, talk to me

When I was on my own
Chasin' you down
What was it made you run
Tryin' to get around

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Come on lover, talk to me


Now that we've found each other
Where do we go now?
I'd like to know what you're thinkin'
Answer me slowly now

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Come on lover, talk to me, yeah
 
Who's that stomping all over my face
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun
To sing in the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joining and a-listening and talking in rhymes
Stopping the feeling to wait for the time
Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
And who's all hung up on that happiness thing
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score
Who's trying to act like he's just in-between
The line isn't black if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be
Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five
Who's got the feeling to keep him alive
Though having it, sharing it ain't quite the same
It ain't a gold nugget, you can't lay a claim
Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor
There it is, baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleeping, but is writing this song
Wishing and a-hoping he weren't so damned wrong
Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
 
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
 
Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?
If it was a game I could play it
Tryin' to make it but I'm losin' time
I got to bring you in, you're overworkin' my mind
Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she'd care
Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared
Once before
Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine (Look so fine)
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?
Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she'd care
Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared
Once before
Do I have to come right out and say it, girl?
Tell you that you look so fine (Look so fine)
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?
If it was a game I could play it
Tryin' to make it but I'm losin' time (Losin' time)
I got to bring you in, you're overworkin' my mind
Do I have to come right out and say it, girl?
Tell you that you look so fine (Look so fine)
 
You ask me to read this letter
That you wrote the night before
And you really should know better
Now she's worth a whole lot more
Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries, is that why
You won't go and say goodbye
Then you said the fault was yours
When you really were to blame
'Twas as if to close the doors
And to hide away in shame
Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries, is that why
You won't go and say goodbye
Yes, and why, tell me why
Can't you see that it's not right
It's a lie, it's a lie
Don't hide your sorrow in the night
Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries, is that why
You won't go and say goodbye
And you know the pain is double
But for her it's even worse
You must face her with the trouble
'Though it's hurting like a curse
Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries, is that why
You won't go and say goodbye
Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries, is that why
You won't go and say
Gonna go and say, gonna go and say goodbye
 
Listen to my song
It isn't very long
You'll see before I'm gone
That everybody's wrong
Those of us who run
To catch a moment in the sun
Seem to find the when we're done
That we weren't supposed to run
And there's too many words going down
They keep wrecking against the walls with the hollow sounds
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you see
It ain't paying, you and me not a crown
Finding what you sought
After all the time you fought
Sometimes leaves you with the thought
That perhaps you just been caught
And there's too many words going down
They keep wrecking against the walls with the hollow sounds
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you see
It ain't paying, you and me not a crown
Finding what you sought
After all the time you fought
Sometimes leaves you with the thought
That perhaps you just been caught
 
I don't tell no tales about no hot dusty roads
I'm a city boy and I stay at home
I make no excuses I just don't want to roam
And I don't like being alone
I give you loving and a place to take off your shoes
It does surprising things for a case of the blues
It ain’t no club, you don’t have to pay no dues
You just love me and I love you
And if you take some pride
In being alive
If you're interested in looking inside
Of yourself
Just drop on by
Baby ask me why
At least you don't have to be by yourself
Just come knock, most likely I'll be there
Then you look around
Find a comfortable chair
And then you sit, and you might think about
Why he's there, I can't tell you why, only where
 
There goes another day
And I wonder why
You and I
Keep telling lies?
I can't believe what you say
'Cause tomorrow's lullaby
Can't pacify
My lonesome crying
Make-believe is all you know
And to make-believe is a game
A child's rein
You've changed your name
So sadly I watch the show
As you see what you became
Truth is a shame
Too much fame
There goes another day
And I wonder why
You and I
Keep telling lies?
 
Been burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful comin' down
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'
Flashed and I think I'm fallin' down
Crashed, and my ears can't hear a sound
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'
Burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful comin' down
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'
 
Out of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for
All I hear are screams from outside the Limousines
That are taking me
Out of my mind
Through the keyhole in an open door
Happy to find
That I don't know what I'm smiling for
Tired of hanging on
If you've missed me
I've just gone
Cause they're taking me
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for
All I hear are screams from outside the Limousines
That are taking me
Out of my mind
