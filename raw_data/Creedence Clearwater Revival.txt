Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, no
But when the taxman come' to the door
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!"
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, son, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yeah!

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?

I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise


Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life

Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

1:14 - 1:50

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearing high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doot, doo doo
A wondrous apparition, provided by magician
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door


Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doot, doo doo
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door
Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows

Early in the evenin', just about supper time
Over by the courthouse, they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard, and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor boy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet


Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner, there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet
Down on the corner, out in the street

Well, take me back down where cool water flow, y’all
Let me remember things I love, ah
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me, aww
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoo fly, dragon fly, get back to your mother
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River
Well


Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world is smolderin'
And if you get lost, come on home to Green River"
Well
Come on home5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton

Whoa, thought it was a nightmare, Lord, it all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow, the Devil's on the loose

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see

Thought I heard a rumblin', callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded, Satan cries, "Take aim"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see


Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom, fill the land with smoke"
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune
And lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar
For every song I sung
Every time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Now, when I was just a little boy
Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My papa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
An' do what he done to me."
Because he'll get you
Because  he'll get you now, now

An' I can remember the fourth o' July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
An' I can still hear my ol' hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, oh, oh


Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
I'm just a chooglin' on down to New Orlean’
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, mm mm mm
Born on the Bayou
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh, Lord

Oh, get back, boy

An' I can remember the fourth o' July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
An' I can still hear my ol' hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, oh, oh
Born on the Bayou

Long as I remember, the rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring, confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun

And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains

And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring, falling on my ears

And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Well, you wake up in the mornin'
You hear the work bell ring
And they march you to the table
You see the same old thing
Ain't no food upon the table
And no pork up in the pan
But you better not complain, boy
You get in trouble with the man

Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special

Let the Midnight Special
Shine a ever lovin' light on me

Yonder come miss Rosie
How in the world did you know?
By the way she wears her apron
And the clothes she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
She come to see the gov'nor
She wants to free her man, lord
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me

If you're ever in Houston
Well, you better do the right
You better not gamble
There and you better not fight, at all
Or the sheriff will grab ya
And the boys will bring you down
The next thing you know, boy
Oh! You're prison bound

Bet you're wondering how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before?
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say, when I found out yesterday

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself that you found someone else
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
People say "You hear from what you see
Not, not, not from what you hear."
I can't help but being confused
If it's true, won't you tell me dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before?

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine

And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

First thing I remember
Was asking papa "Why?"
For there were many things I didn't know

And Daddy always smiled
Took me by the hand
Saying, "Someday
You'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes

The time and tears went by
And I collected dust
For there were many things
I didn't know

When Daddy went away
He said, "Try to be a man
And, Someday you'll understand"
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes

And then, one day in April
I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know

A son was born to me
Mama held his hand
Saying "Someday you'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
Ooh, someday never comes

Think it was September
The year I went away
For there were many things
I didn't know
And I still see him standin
Tryin' to be a man
I said, "Someday
You'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
Ooh someday never comes

There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Oooh!

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Oooh!

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!

Oooh!

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen
Laid on the ground and shook, fearing for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screaming "It came out of the sky"

Well, a crowd gathered 'round and a scientist said it was marsh gas
Spiro came and made a speech about raising the Mars tax
The Vatican said, "Woe, the Lord has come"
Hollywood rushed out an epic film
And Ronnie the Popular said it was a communist plot

Oh, the newspapers came and made Jody a national hero
Walter and Eric said they'd put him on a network TV show
The White House said, "Put the thing in the Blue Room"
The Vatican said, "No, it belongs to Rome."
And Jody said, "It's mine, but you can have it for seventeen million."
