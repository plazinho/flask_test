Through the valleys of this life I have wandered
And I've worked for Jesus all along the way
But now I see the sun for me is setting
I have reached the ending of my way
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home
Looking back upon the life I've lived for Jesus
I can see how He has helped me all the way
And the tears I've shed just helped to keep me humble
And each burden only taught me how to pray
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home
Though I hate to leave so many friends behind me
And the parting of our ways will touch my heart
But I'll wait for them inside the gates of heaven
Where the children of God will never part
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray
I attended service at a little church
In the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
"My God is real"
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard
In the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, "Preacher, tell them that satan is real too"
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment
Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astrayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I met a little girl in Knoxville, a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening, out in her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
Oh Willie dear don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My Mother she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying "Dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?"
I told my anxious Mother, I was bleeding at my nose
I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a hankerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night throught, as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see
They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so wellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
Do you fear this man's invention
That they call atomic power
Are we all in great confusion
Do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion
May rain down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction
Blotting out the works of man
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
There is one way to escape it
Be prepared to meet the lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus
He will be your shielding sword
He will surely stay beside you
And you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety
And eternal peace and rest
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
There's an army who can conquer
All the enemy's great band
It's the regiment of Christians
Guided by the Savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls
Fall in all it's fury great
God will surely save His children
From that awful awful fate
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Last night, my dear, the rain was falling
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then, I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
And then we met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
"I don't believe you've met my baby"
You looked at him, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on his shoulder
You smiled at him, he smiled at you
His eyes were filled with victory
He said, "My sister wants to marry"
Then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Kneel at the cross, Christ will meet you there
Come while He waits for you
Listen to His voice, leave with Him your cares
And begin life anew
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there
Kneel at the cross, there is room for all
Who would His glory share
Bliss there awaits, harm can nary fall
Those who are anchored there
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you there
Kneel at the cross, give your idols up
Look unto realms above
Turn not away to life's sparkling cup
Trust only in His love
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Jesus will meet you thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
Thats made you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Was 19 coaches long
The only girl I ever loved
Is on that train and gone
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blowsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh Katie dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking
She's in her room a takin’ rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Oh Katie dear go ask your father
If you can be a bride of mine
If he says yes come back and tell me
If he says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear, there's no use in asking
He’s in his room a takin’ rest
And by his side there's a golden dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Then he picked up this golden dagger
And stove it through his troubled heart
Saying goodbye Katie goodbye darlin'
At last the time has come to part
Then she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lily-white breast
Saying goodbye papa goodbye mama
I'll die with the one that I love bestEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone else
And asked me if I could forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop wanting you
I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected, transplanted in vain
To a garden of sadness where it's petals would fall
In the shadow of undying pain
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop thinking of you
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop crying for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone

The milkman whistles softly as he comes up to my door
The mailman brings the letters by just like he did before
They seem so busy all day long as though there's nothing wrong
Don't they know the world has ended? My baby's gone

Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone


I wake up sometimes in the night and realize you're gone
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone
But it cries, "The world has ended, my baby's gone"
Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended, my baby's gone6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
To the River Of Jordan our Savior went one day
And we read that John The Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air
I'm on my way to the River Of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I'm going down to the River Of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul
King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman "go dip yourself in Jordan"
And let the cool waters wash your spots away
So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself in the River Of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole
Oh the River Of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an alter in an old fashioned church
And my River Of Jordan that will beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'll deck my brow with roses
My true love may be there
And gems that others gave me
Shall shine within my hair
And even them that know me
Will think my heart is light
Though my heart will break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight
And when the room he entered
The bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him
As though he were a charm
And then he smiled upon her
As once he smiled on me
They know not what
I suffered
They found no change in me
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight
And when the dance is over
And all have gone to rest
I'll think of him, dear mother
The one that I love best
He once did love, believe me
But now he's cold and strange
He sought not to deceive me
False friends have brought this change
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
A house not a home was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was prayin'
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he'd swear his voice low and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside the house of God
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on Mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in Heaven last night
I heard my daddy pray "Dear God, make it right"
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When burdens seem to overcome there's a higher power
Who's able and refuses none there's a higher power
Then why ask men to help you through there's a higher power
They're helpless pilgrims just like you there's a higher power
So sing and shout walk and talk there's a higher power
Lay down your soul cause Jesus bought it there's a higher power
Amen amen amen amen there's a higher power
Amen amen amen amen there's a higher power
Oh go tell people lost in sin there's a higher power
They need not fear the works of men there's a higher power
Believe in him to rest on high there's a higher power
Unless they do they'll surely die there's a higher power
Those men have built these mighty guns there's a higher power
They've built these automobiles that run there's a higher power
But brothers and sisters mark this down there's a higher power
They can't build you no heavenly crown there's a higher powerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict I was a guilty man
He said, "Forty five dollars or thirty days in the can"
That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
You can make your choice, you're twenty one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you 'cause I'm a busy man
Found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good hearted jailer with a six gun hip
He let me call long distance, she said, "Number please"
And no sooner than I told her she shouted out at me
That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
Not part, not half but the entire sum
No money down, no credit plan
'Cause a little bird tells me you're a traveling man
Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry, my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming, stuck up my thumb
Just as I was being seated the driver caught my arm
That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
This old grey dog is paid to run
When the engine stops, the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrel head, I'll take you down the road

"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
"Bring my darling boy to me"
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late
Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in heaven, his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
I know that God in heaven looked downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Kentucky, you are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky, your laurels and your redbud trees
When I die, I want to rest upon your graceful mountain so high
Kentucky, that is where God will look for me


Kentucky, I miss the voices singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky, I miss the hound dog chasing coon
I know that my mother, dad and sweetheart all are waiting for me
Kentucky, I will be coming soon

Kentucky, I will be coming soonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
She's mine everywhere she may be
She may ramble this wide world all over
But she'll never find a friend like me
I went to church last Sunday
I saw my old true love there
And I knew her mind was a'changin'
From the way that she done up her hair

I'm going to the races
To see my pony run
And if I win any green back
We're sure gonna have some fun

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
But sometimes
I take a good notion
To jump in the river and drown

I like the Christian life
My buddies tell me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian life
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I still love them they burden my heart
I'll try to lead them to walk in the light
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He can be found in a mother's smile
He can be found in the eyes of a child
He can be found He is everywhere
When we kneel in prayer each plea He hears
He can be found in the air that we breath
He'll always hear a heart that grieves
He can be found on life's stormy seas
He can be found in you and me
He can be found in the hearts of great men
He will reach down for one who has sinned
The peasant's daughter or the rich man's son
All who believe and who will let Him comeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
