The world is in a maze
The way of life today
Is strange and odd
What happened across the sea
May come to you and me
Oh, come let us go back to God
Oh come on, let us go back
Come on, let us go back
I know the way
Without my Lord is mighty hard
That I know death has marked a path
Death has marked a path we trod
Come on, let us go back, go back to God
There's trouble in the air
Destruction is everywhere
And man are being tramped
Beneath the soil
And nations great and small
Have now begun to fall
Oh, come let us go back to God
Go back to God
 
When your way gets dark as night
Jesus will bring things out alright

Until the end
In my Savior, always trust
Don't lose your faith and hope in disgust
For he's your friend, I know he is, now
Until the end

And every step of the way
When from the fold I stray
He tenderly gathers me in
I never have to worry
I know he's always there to defend
Jesus is a friend
Why don't you try my God now
Until the end?
Times may come when you may doubt
But just have faith and he'll bring you out
He'll be your friend, I know he will now
Until the end
Then one day you'll see God's face
After you've won this Christian race
He'll be your friend, I know he will now
Until the end

And every step of the way
When from the fold I may stray
I know he tenderly gathers me in

I can tell the world about this
I can tell the nation that I'm blessed
Tell them what my Jesus has done
Tell them that the comforter has come
And he brought joy, great joy unto my soul
Well my Lord done just what he said

Oh Father, You've been my friend
Now that I'm in trouble
Stand by me to the end, oh Lord
I want You to stand by, stand by
Well, all of my money and my friends are gone
Lord, I'm in a mean world
And I'm so all alone, oh Lord
I need You, Jesus, stand by, stand by
Well, they tell me
That Samson killed in ancient times
I know that You helped him kill
Ten thousand Philistines, oh Lord
Whoa, I need You, stand by, stand by
Here's another thing
They tell me that they put Daniel
Down in the lion's den
I know You went down there, Father
You free Daniel once again
That's why I said, oh Lord
Do me like You did Daniel
And stand by, stand by
Well, sometimes I feel
Like the weight of the world
Is on my shoulders and it's all in vain
When I begin to feel weak along the way
You come and You give me strength again, oh
The Hebrew children have been in fire
Ten times hotter that it ought to be
Just like You delivered them, Father
I know You can deliver me, oh Lord
I'm calling You, Jesus, stand by, stand by
When I'm sick, Father
Stand by me
When the doctor walk away from my bedside
Stand by me, Father
When it seem like I don't have a friend
I wonder will You be my friend?
Stick closer than my brother
Stand by
 
If I walk in the pathway of duty
If I work ?til the close of the day, Lord
I shall see the great king in all his beauty
When I've gone the last mile of the way, Lord, yes sir
When I've gone the last mile of the way, oh yeah
I shall rest at the close of day
For I know there are joy awaiting
When I've gone the last mile of the way
If I were, for Christ to proclaim the glad story, oh Lord
If I see for his sheep who gone astray, oh Lord
I am sure he will show me in his glory
When I've gone the last mile of the way, Lord, yes sir
When I've gone the last mile of the way, oh yes
I shall rest at the close of day, oh yeah
For I know, there are joy awaiting
When I've gone the last mile of the way

Woah, Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water and it was not in the well

Paroles de la chanson End Of My Journey :
Wow singing if when you give
The best of your service
Telling the world that the savior has come
You be not dismayed
When men don't believe you
I know he'll understand
And he'll say well done
Misunderstood, O Lord
The savior of sinners
How did he die on the cross
Tell me he was God 's only son
Singing o, hear him call
To his father up in heaven
Crying not by will
Till ?? be done
When I come
To the end of my journey
I'll be waried of life
Tell me that the battle will be won
I'll be carrying the staff
And the cross of redemption
I know he'l understand
And he'll say well done
Well done
You know that he'll understand
He'll say well done
 
When you have troubles, don't cry
Just remember that God is standing near by
And if disappointment come, it will surely pass by
So don't you worry, don't be discouraged and don't cry, no
Oh, God is standing by
So hush, there's no need to cry, no
Oh, God is standing by
So hush, wipe your eyes and don't cry, no, listen
And when you have heartaches
You wanna know why sometimes, listen
Just remember that God is standing near by
And when you have troubles, don't cry, no, no
He told me, that He would always be standing near by
Oh, God is standing by
He told me that He would always be standing by, oh yeah
Oh, God is standing by
So hush and wipe your eyes and don't cry
 
Somebody knows when I am taunted
Somebody cares when things go wrong
Somebody's love is always there to guide you
And make you strong, oh Lord
Lord, I have a friend, He's above all others
His love is so far beyond brothers
Eternal life is yours to know Him
Savior divine, friend of mine
But Lord, I cannot tell how much I love Him
I cannot tell, all of my God's love for me
I only know cannot be measured
Deeper than the sea, Lord
Jesus alone can know my sadness
Jesus alone can bring me gladness
I'm filled with joy just because I know Him
Savior divine, friend of mine
But Lord, I have a friend above all others
Who's love is far beyond brothers
Eternal life, I know is yours to know Him
It's deeper than the sea
 
Oh Lord, the time is growing nigh
When I must breathe my last breath inside
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Oh Lord, my friends have gathered 'round
They're watching me slowly, slowly sinking down
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Now Lord, now Lord, now Jesus time have come
When I'm a leave my earthly home
Friends standing around, tear in the eyes
They know that I am about to die
But I'm not worried, I'm not afraid
I know you do, Jesus, just what You say
Come with me and follow ???
You be with me Lord, day and night
I'm not afraid, I said I'm dying, don't leave me now
Oh Lord, I know you'll stand by me
When I'm in trouble, when I'm in misery
And Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Oh oh Lord, I know You'll stand by Your word
Whenever I call You, I know You have already heard
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Now Lord, I said farewell, fare thee well
Fare thee well to my friends down here
I got loved ones waiting for me up there
Oh Lord, others are waiting for me
What a reunion, I know that will be
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
 
Must Jesus bear this cross alone
And all this world go free?
There's the cross for everyone
And the the cross for me
Amazing grace, how sweet, how sweet it all sounds
I know, You saved, You saved the rich like me
Then I was once lost but know I now that I'm found
I was blind but now I know that I can see
Not alone, not alone, not alone
No Jesus cannot bear this cross alone
There's the cross for everyone and the cross for me
I came to my Jesus just as, just as I was
I was weary, I was wounded and sad
But I know that I found in Him a resting, a resting place
And now, right now my heart, my heart feel bad, oh, Lord
Not alone, not alone, not alone
No, not alone, oh, Jesus, not alone
No not alone, I know, the world go free
There's the cross for everyone and I know, the cross for me

One of these mornings
I'm a-going away
Any day now
I'm going to heaven to stay
I don't know how soon
May be morning, night or noon
But I'm a-going to see the Father
And by his side to stand
There'll be no sorrow
No sadness
Just only complete gladness
But any day I know I
Am a-going home
Then I"ll shout "Hallelujah"
And your praises to the name, but oh
But any day I know, I know that I
Am a-going home
 
Them was going to Jerusalem
He met two strangers along the way
They were talking all about the Crucifixion
They stopped and here's what he said, he asked them
Were you there when they crucified the Lord?
(Were you there?)
Were you there when they crucified the Lord?
He asked them, were you there when the crucified the Lord?
And one of them told him
No, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
He said I was there
I was there when they crucified the Lord
A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
Tell me, did they really pierce Him in the side that morn
O Lord, he said if you were there
I wonder did they pierce the Savior in the side?
Sometimes it causes me to tremble
Every time I think about how they did the Lord
It makes me tremble 'cause I was there
And they really pierced him in the side that morning
A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
If you were there kindly tell me
Did he hang there and never say one word?
Sometimes I have to tremble
Every time I think about how they done the Lord
It makes me tremble
'Cause I was there when they crucified the Lord
