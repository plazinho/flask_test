You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul, baby

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see
So in love when we're together
Now I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
When you love somebody 'til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind
No one needs you more than I
When you love somebody 'til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind
I need you
 
Waiting for the break of day
Searching for something to say
Flashing lights against the sky
Giving up, I close my eyes

Sitting cross-legged on the floor
Twenty five or six to four

Staring blindly into space
Getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake
Wondering how much I can take

Should I try to do some more?
Twenty five or six to four
Oh yeah


Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day

Twenty five or six to four
Twenty five or six to four
 
"Everybody needs a little time away"
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
You're going to be the lucky one


(Get Away)
When we get there gonna jump in the air
No one'll see us because there's nobody there
After all, you know we really don't care
Hold on, I'm going to take you there
 
If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go

And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh girl, I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today


A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go

Ooh girl, I just got to have you by my side
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh mama, I just got to have your lovin'
 
When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing, I'm with you, that's all that matters
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Mmm, silent la la la la la
Never think of bad words to say

When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings
The color of chills all over my body
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Mostly I'm silent
Silent la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Silent

Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever, yeah
Oh no whoa
Yes, only the beginning of what I want to feel forever
Only the beginning, only just the start, yeah
I've got to get you into my life
Got to get you next to me, yeah
Only the beginning, only just the start

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Mm hmm mm mm mm


Only the beginning

As time goes on

And now
Now that you're near
Promise your love

And dreams
Of our moments together
Color my world
With hope of loving you

Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs

Eh Cumpari, ci vo sunari
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar
Singing for us all

Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children, all is not lost
All is not lost, oh no oh

Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July (Yes it is)
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, really touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all

If you want it, really want it
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day, yeah yeah yeah
 
Well my Daddy said I'm messy 'bout the whiskers on my chin
Never had no problems 'cause I've always paid the rent
I got no time for loving 'cause my time is all used up
I spend my time creating for some groovy kinds of love

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

If I had my choice of matter, I'd rather be content
Being closer to the chatter, showing where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how strong your love could be
'Cept for only sometimes groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so


If I had my choice of matter, I would rather be content
All engrossed in mental chatter, showin' where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how good your love can be
Resisting only some times groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
 
As I was walking down the street one day
A man came up to me and asked me
What the time was that was on my watch
Yeah... and I said

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

And I was walking down the street one day
A pretty lady looked at me
And said her diamond watch had stopped cold dead
And I said

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so, I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to cry

And I was walking down the street one day
Being pushed and shoved by people
Trying to beat the clock, oh, no
I just don't know, I don't know, I don't know-oh
And I said... yes, I said
(Background:)
People runnin' everywhere
Don't know where to go
Don't know where I am
Can't see past the next step
Don't have time to think past the last one
Have no time to look around
Just run around, run around think why

(I don't) Does anybody really know what time it is?
(Care) Does anybody really care?
(About time) If so I can't imagine why
(Oh no, no) We've all got time enough to die

Everybody's working
(I don't care) I don't care
(About time) About time
(Oh no, no) I don't care
 
Sleepless hours and dreamless nights and far aways
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Heaven knows, and Lord it shows, when I'm away
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

Same old show in a different town on another time
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Even though you're far away, you're on my mind
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

And I'd like to change my life, and you know I would
Just to be with you tonight, baby, if I could
But I've got my job to do, and I do it well, oh
(Change my life, change my life)
So I guess that's how it is

Ooh, wishing you were here
Ooh, wishing you were here
Ooh, wishing you were here (Wishing you were here)
Wishing you were here (You were here)

On the road it's a heavy load, but I'll be by
Ooh ooh ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Pay the price, make a sacrifice, and still I'll try
Ooh ooh ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)

Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Ooh, wishing you were (Wishing you were here)
Wishing you were here
Wishing
Wishing
 
Take me as I am
Put your hand in mine now and forever (Forever)
Darling here I stand, stand before you now
Deep inside I always knew
It was you, you and me
Two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you and you for me
Every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own (My own)

Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
Because I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove
There was you
You and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on (Can't go on)
If I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so strong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on
If I'm on my own
I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)

Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be alone
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be alone
 
I guess I thought you'd be here
Forever
Another illusion
I chose to create
You don't know what you got
Until it's gone
And I found out
A little too late

I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone
And it was all wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you, babe
You're a hard habit to break

You found someone else
You had every reason
Know I can't blame you
For running to him
Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading my love too thin

After all of these years
I'm still trying to shake it
Doing much better (They say that it just takes time)
But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you, babe
You're a hard habit to break

I can't go on (Can't go on)
Just can't go on (Just can't go on)
I can't go on (Can't go on)
Just can't go on (Just can't go on)

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you, babe
You're a hard habit to break

You're a hard (You're a) habit to (Hard) break (Habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
Such a hard (Such a) habit to (Hard) break (Habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
I'm addicted to you
You're a hard (You're a) habit to (Hard) break (Habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
Such a hard (Such a) habit to (Hard) break (Habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
I'm addicted to you, baby!
 
Can this feeling that we have together
Ooh, suddenly exist between?
Did this meeting of our minds together
Ooh, happen just today, somewhere?

I'd like to know
Can you tell me? Please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Was your image in my mind so deeply?
Ooh, other faces fade away
Blocking memories of unhappy hours
Ooh, leavin' just a burnin' love

I'd like to know
Can you tell me? Please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing
Got to know now, baby


Can this lovin' we have found within us
Ooh, suddenly exist between?
Did we somehow try to make it happen
Ooh, was it just a natural thing?

I'd like to know
Can you tell me? Please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing
Yes, it does now, baby

Questions 67 and 68
 
I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And now we realize
Love's not all that it's supposed to be
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feeling stronger every day

I know we really tried
Together we had love inside
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feeling stronger every day

After what you've meant to me
Ooh baby now
I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that we both agree
Best thing to happen to you
The best thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We love you

Merely by chance
Very unsuspecting
You caught my heart
Unprotecting me
Now I'm fallin' in love with you

Just when I thought
I was free and easy
You came along
To me soft and breezy
Now I've fallen in love with you

Woo hoo
I've fallen in love with you

And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man, mhm
Happy man
And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can understand, mhm
Being a happy man

Be with me now
Love me forever
Leaving you lady
Was something that I'd never do
I've fallen in love with you

All of my life
It seems I have waited
Now I can say
All these words I have stated are true
I've fallen in love with you

Woo hoo
I've fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
Ooh, uh
 
Hoo hoo hoo yeah

You are my love in my life
And you are my inspiration
Just you and me
Simple and free
Baby, you're everything I've ever dreamed of
Yeah, yeah

Give me your own special smile
Promise you'll never leave me
Just you and me
Simple and free
Life is so easy
When you're beside me
Oh girl

Come hold me close
Yeah, never release me
(Oh baby don't release me)
Open your arms, let my love in
(Let me in, let me in, let me in)
Love me tonight
Yeah
Love me forever
And ever

You are my inspiration
Just you and me

Baby, you're everything I've ever dreamed of
Yeah, yeah
 
Hey there, everybody
Please don't romp or roam
We're a little nervous
'Cause we're so far from home

So this is what we do
Sit back and let us groove
And let us work on you, yeah, mm

We've all spent years preparing
Before this group was born
With Heaven's help, it blended
And we do thank the Lord

So if you've nothing to do
Sit back and let us through
And let us play for you


Now we put you through the changes
And turned around the mood
We hope it's struck you different
And hope you feel moved

So forget about your troubles
As we search for something new
And we play for you
 
Old days
Good times, I remember
Fun days
Filled with simple pleasure
Drive-in movies
Comic books and blue jeans
Howdy Doody
Baseball cards and birthdays

Take me back
To a world gone away
Memories
Seem like yesterday


Old days
Good times, I remember
Gold days
Days I'll always treasure
Funny faces
Full of love and laughter
Funny places
Summer nights and streetcars

Take me back
To the world gone away
Boyhood memories
Seem like yesterday

Old days
On my mind and in my heart to stay (Ah)
Old days
Darkened dreams of good times gone away (Ah)
Old days
Days of love and feeling fancy free (Ah)
Old days
Days of magic still so close to me (Ah)
Old days
On my mind and in my heart to stay (Ah)
Old days
Darkened dreams of good times gone away (Ah)
Old days
Days of love and feeling fancy free (Ah)
Old days
 
When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"
Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming around
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby, whoa...
And from what you saying
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's got to be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, whoa...
I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way


If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me
If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me

When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"
