Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah

Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da

My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
The true love we share today

Hey, hey, hey

Dance, boogie wonderland, hah, hah

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face

You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
Temperature's rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
And I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la

After all our reasons why

No longer feeling hypnotized
Find our reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Had no pride

After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons, love
Love was left aside

People of the world all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own, yeah

Master told me one day
I'd find peace in every way
But in search for the clue
Wrong things I was bound to do
Keep my head to the sky
For the clouds to tell me why
As I grew, and with strength
Master kept me as I repent
And he said!

Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

He gave me the will to be free
Purpose to live His reality
Hey, and I found myself never alone
Chances came to make me strong
To step right up and be a man
Cause you need faith to understand
So we're saying for you to hear
Keep your head in faith's atmosphere

Keep your head to the sky
So the clouds
Keep your head to the sky
So they can tell you why, Lord
Keep your head to the sky
Surely, the clouds are gonna tell you why
 
Would you mind
If I touched, if I kiss, if I held you tight?
In the morning light, yeah
Would you mind
If I said how I felt tenderly tonight?
Again 'cause I never ever felt this way
In my heart before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart, tonight, yeah, yeah
Would you mind
If I looked in your eyes 'til I'm hypnotized?
And I lose my pride, yeah
Would you mind (Hey, do you mind?)
If I made love to you 'til I'm satisfied?
Once again 'cause I never felt, felt this way
In my heart, oh before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart, tonight
Once again 'cause I never ever felt this way
In my heart before, oo, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart, tonight

Oh love

Make love to you, baby, 'til I'm satisfied
Look into your eyes 'til I'm hypnotized
Make love to you, baby, 'til I'm satisfied
Look into your eyes
 
I thirst but never quench
I know the consequence, feeling as I do
We're in a spinning top
Where, tell me, will it stop?
And what am I to say?
Open our music book, that only few can look
And I'll write a song for you
Love is a symphony, hearts in one melody
'Cause I'll write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate
They only recreate in another place
There's in your silent night
Joy of a song's delight
'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
We'll write a song of love, of love
My magical mystique
Finding it all complete
In your lovely face
Feelings we try to chase
Memories that won't erase
Stay forever new
We have a magic box in which is never locked
'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
We'll write a song of love, of love, yeah
We write a song of love, my baby
Write a song of love
(You, for you, you, for you, you, you)
We have a magic box
We write a song of love
We write, write a song of love
Sounds, they never dissipate
They only recreate
To another place or time
We write a song, we write a song
Just you and me, baby
We're... We're on a spinning top
We write a song
We write a song
We write a song
 
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
And no matter how you try to hide, it states your case
Now a frown will bring your spirits down to the ground
And never let you see the good things all around
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck run out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Help you set your pace
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)
Wish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
We wonder how your attitude is going down
Is it waking and shaking and safe and sound?
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Life is on your case

Yes it is, yeah
This world can't shake me (This world can't shake me)
Bad times can't make me sad
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow, I'll feel the same old way
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wake me, my heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feeling bad
Use the sunshine in your heart (Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow, I'll feel the same old way
I start to wonder what's goin' down, gotta feel it, feel it
Wake me, my heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feeling bad
I start to wonder what's going down
In your life, is it safe and sound?
I start to wonder, is your life alright?
Are you dealing with it every day it cause you strife?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

Blow my mind (you're so fine)
Ooh, yeah (out of my mind)
Out of my mind (out of my mind)

Would you mind if I touch, if I kiss
If I held you tight in the morning light? Yeah
Would you mind if I said
How I felt tenderly tonight again?
'Cause I never ever felt
This way in my heart before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart, yeah
Would you mind if I looked in your eyes till
I'm hypnotized and I lose my pride? yeah
Would you mind if I make love to you
Till I'm satisfied once again?
'Cause I never ever felt
Felt this way in my heart oh before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart tonight
