Out here
Barely see my breath
Surrounded
By jealousy and death
I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you all
You all
This time
Lost my own return
In spite of
Everything I've learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks
Stripped of all my cares
My cares
I'm so tired
Sheep are counting me
No more struggle
No more energy
No more patient
You can write that down
It's all too crazy
I'm not sticking 'round
 
I am a patient boy
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait
My time is like water down a drain
Everybody's moving, everybody's moving
Everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving
Please don't leave me to remain
In the waiting room

I don't want the news (I cannot use it)
I don't want the news (I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up

(Ahh, come on and get up)
(Come on and get up)

But I don't sit idly by (ahh)
I'm planning a big surprise
I'm gonna fight for what I wanna be
And I won't make the same mistakes (Because I know)
Because I know how much time that wastes
(And function), function is the key
To the the waiting room

I don't want the news (I cannot use it)
I don't want the news (I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up

(Ahh, come on and get up)

Up for the waiting room

Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up
 
You can't be what you were
So you better start being
Just what you are
You can't be what you were
The time is now, it's running out
It's running out, it's running, running, running out
You can't be what you were
So you better start living the life
That you're talking about
You can't be what you were
The no movement, the no movement
The no movement in a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
The no movement in a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
The no movement, in a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
You're always talking, talking, talking, talking, talking shit now
But you will talk yourself down
You're going way down!
 
You say I need a job
I've got my own business
You want to know what I do?
None of your fucking business
But now I'm lying here
And knowing that business
I had a name, but now I'm a number

Down by law
I've got this nasty habit
When I need something
I just reach out and grab it
Once upon a time I had a name and a way

Did you hear something outside?
It sounded like a gun
Stay away from that window, boy
It's not anyone that we know
Only about ourselves and
What we read in the paper
Don't you know ink washes out
Easier than blood
But we don't have to try it
And we don't have to buy it

You've got

Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Is my body my only trait in the eyes of men?
In the eyes of men
I've got some skin
When you want to look in
I've got some
There lays no reward (in what you, in what you)
In what you discover
You spent yourself, boy
Watching me suffer
Suffer your words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands
Suffer your interpretation (of what it is)
Of what it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is) to be a man
I've got some skin
When you wanna look in
Well, I've got some
She does nothing to deserve it
He touches her 'cause he wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us
He just wants, he wants to prove it
She does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us
So we play the roles that they assigned us
She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there
We are all here
But we are all...
Guilty!
 
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
You've got your hands over your ears
You've got your mouth running on
You've got your eyes looking for something
That can never be found
Like a reason
Good god, I don't need a reason
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never thought on the dying
I never ever held the hand of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
And you've got to, and you've got to
And you've got to
Gimme the shot
Gimme the pill
Gimme the cure
Now what you've done to my world
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never thought on the dying
I never walked the side of dying before
And now I'm feel like I'm...
And now I'm feel like I'm... (it breaks, it breaks, it breaks, yeah)
Under your skin
Cap over your eyes
I'm at the tip of your finger
(it breaks, it breaks, it breaks, yeah)
Tell me the reason
Gimme the shot
Gimme the pill
Gimme the cure (it breaks, it breaks, it breaks)
Now what you've done to my world
(Coming around, coming around)
(Coming around, coming down)
(Give me the shot)
(Give me the pill)
(Give me the cure)
(Now what you've done to my world)
(Give me the shot)
Now c'mon (give me the pill)
(Give me the cure)

Gimme the shot
 
Words
Words and expressions
All these confessions
Of where we stand
How I see you
And you see me
Dedications of symmetry
Together
We will be forever
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see it through
Stupid fucking words
Tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
There were no truer words than when spoken
Let that stand as it should
There was nothing left when broken
We grab anything when we fall
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see us through
Stupid fucking words
Tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
You will do what you do
And I will do what I do
And we will do what we do
Rearrange, see it through
You will do what you do
And I will do what I do
And we will do what we do
Rearrange, see it through

Go where you think you wanna go
Do everything you were sent here for
Fire at will if you hear that call
Touch your hand to the wall at night

When we have nothing left to give
There will be no reason for us to live
But when we have nothing left to lose
You will have nothing left to use

We owe you nothing
You have no control
We owe you nothing
You have no control

Merchandise, it keeps us in line
Common sense says it's by design
What could a businessman ever want more
Than to have us sucking in his store

We owe you nothing
You have no control
We owe you nothing
You have no control

You are not what you own
You are not what you own
You are not what you own
You are not what you own

We owe you nothing
You have no control
We owe you nothing (nothing)

Languor rises reaching
To turn off the alarm
And there's never so much seething
That it can't be disarmed

You just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To leave it off and
Turn over

Lounging against your weapons
Until your muscles find lock
In the ease of that position
A residue of tremor passes
As some cherie amour suggests
Maybe it was time to smash things up

But just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and
Turn over

Stop, turnover
Stop, turn over

Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and
Turn over
To just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and

I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I clean forgot how to play
But you can still come around
In fact I invite you down
Maybe together
We can wipe that smile off your face
'Cause what a difference
What a difference
What a difference
A little difference would make
We'll draw a blueprint
It must be easy
It's just a matter
Of knowing when to say no or yes
Frustrating, frustrating
Always waiting for the bigger axe to fall
A patient game I can't find my way to play
Find my way to play
Not knowing

You think this shit just dropped right out of the sky
My analysis:
It's time to harvest the crust from your eyes
To surge and refine
To rage and define ourselves
Against your line
So sorry friend, you must resign

You want to figure it out
We'll throw down
We'll throw down
We'll throw down
You want to figure it out
Well throw down your bulldog front

Bold, bold mouth talking, not so bold
Now that you've eaten your own
Lips flecked, mouth specked
You strip the skin right off of the bone
But I would never say
You act without precision or care, but
It's all attention to armor
To the armor you wear so well

You want to figure it out
We'll throw down
We'll throw down
You want to figure it out
We'll throw down your bulldog front

You want to figure it out

I broke the surface so I can breathe
I close my eyes so I can see
I tie my arms to be free
Have you ever been free?

She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back

I burn a fire to stay cool
I burn myself, I am the fuel
I never meant to be cruel
Have you ever been cruel?

She's not breathing
She's not moving
She's not coming back, back, back

Shut the door, so I can leave
Shut the door
 
On the morning of the first eviction
They carried out the wishes of the landlord and his son
Furniture's out on the sidewalk next to the family
That little piggie went to market so they're kicking out everyone

Talking about process and dismissal
Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

The elected are such willing partners
Look who's buying all their tickets to the game
Development wants, development gets, it's official
Development wants this neighborhood gone so the city just wants the same

Talking about process and dismissal
Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location

Everybody wants somewhere, somewhere

When they start falling, executions will commence
Sides will not matter now, matter makes no sense
How did a difference become a disease?
I'm sure you have reasons, a rational defence
Weapons and motives, bloody fingerprints
But I can't help thinking it's still all disease
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument

It's all about strikes now
So here's what's striking me
That some punk could argue
Some moral ABC's
When people are catching
What bombers release
I'm on a mission
To never agree
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument

I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see
I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see

It's all illusion, set scenery

Yes I know this is politically correct
But it comes to you spiritually direct
An attempt to thoughtfully affect your way of thinking
That is if you believe in race
And that you were born in the right time or place
That is a thought about face your way of thinking
Your way of...
Your way of...
Your way of...
Your way of...
And the same could be said
For all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found out a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now
And now it's nothing but reaction
If you have to carry a gun
To keep your fragile seat at number one
This is a bullet
You can't outrun... Your way of thinking
So wait and see it's coming round
Conscripted through the lost and found
And still we find so tightly wound
Your way of thinking
Your way of...
Your way of...
Your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now
And now there's nothing but reaction
Action, reaction

You make yourself so beautiful
You make yourself so, so beautiful
And I feel like I'm gonna
I'm gonna set myself on fire
I'm gonna set myself up at a window
This margin walker wants a clear view
This margin walker wants a clear shot
And now I'm shooting it right on you

Untraceable, untranslatable (Now)
Can't explain all I ever wanted to do (And it comes)
Trajectory passing right through me
Threads my needle, sends it right through you

You make yourself so visible
You make yourself so, so visible
And I feel, I feel like I'm
In the tread of some bastard jealousy
Up here, above the avenue
Up here, where the things you do
They lend me a problem with the language
Split my seams and then they drop in a fuse

Untraceable (Now), untranslatable (Now)
I can't explain all I ever wanted to do (And it comes)
Trajectory passing right through me
Threads my needle, sends it right to you

You, I want a clear shot to you (You)
To you (You), I want a clear shot to you (You)
You want the motherlode? I'll swing a payload
You pull my trigger, send it right to you
You want the motherlode? I swing a payload
You pull my trigger, send it right to you

(Oh, yeah)
Untraceable, untranslatable (Now)
I can't explain all I ever wanted to do (And it comes)
Trajectory passing right through me
Pull my trigger, send it right to you
 
Your eyes like crashing jets
Fixed in stained glass
But not religious
You should pay rent in my mind
Say like the French say:
"Bonsoir, regret, à demain"
À demain, à demain
À demain, à demain
À demain, à demain
À demain, à demain

There's something acting on this body
Something goes in when nothing comes out
And someone's acting on this information
But nothing's registered from this location
From this site that I sense that I am in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
I wanted a language of my own
My lips were sucked empty and I mouthed the lines
Of this crowd that surrounds me
Punctured and parcelled I fold my hand
To this site that I sense that I am in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning in my eyes?
What is this burning my eyes?
There’s something acting but it doesn’t complete
Don't you know what I mean?
There's something burning in my eyes
There's something burning in my eyes
There's something burning in my eyes
There's something burning my eyes
