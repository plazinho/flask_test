So messed up I want you here
In my room I want you here
Now we're gonna be Face-to-face
And I'll lay right down In my favorite place

And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well come on

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sands

And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well come on
 
I'm a street walking cheetah
With a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

Honey gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, detonate for me!

Look out honey, cause I'm using technology!
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight

Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin' only to destroy
Hey!

Look out honey, cause I'm using technology!
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight

Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind

And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy

Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said
Hey forgotten boy
 
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel with you at ease
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel your disease

There's nothing in my dreams
Just some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze

Now, if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you can be my master
I will do anything

There's nothing left alive
But a pair of glassy eyes
Raise my feelings one more time

Find a little stranger
Find a little stranger
Say you're gonna feel my hand
Say, gotta gimme danger, wild little stranger
Honey, gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand

Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Gimme danger
Gotta feel me
Gotta feel me
Little stranger

Baby, and now you're gonna try to bring me
Try to bring me to the end

I need somebody, baby

I need somebody, baby
Just like you, just like you, just like you

You took my arm and you broke my will
You made me shiver with a real thrill
You took my arm and we walked along
Down the road to a quiet song
I looked into your cool, cool eyes
I felt so fine, I felt so fine
I floated in your swimming pools
I felt so weak, I felt so blue
Ann, my Ann
I love you
Ann, my Ann
I love you right now!
 

 
Honey, honey
Alright
A girl will steer you wrong
A song can drive you blind
I move to master my machine
And I will not stand in line
Sick boy, sick boy, going wrong
Memory losing grip
Baby, I wanna take you out with me
Come along on my death trip
Come on my death trip
Honey honey, honey my death trip

Tell me, do you care for me?
Once I cared for you
Honey, come and be my enemy so I can love you true
A sick boy, sick boy, fading out, learning to be cruel
Baby, whip me in the heat
Turn me loose on you
Loose on you, honey, loose on you
Honey, loose on you, honey, loose on you

Turn me, turn me loose on you
Turn me, baby, loose on you
Turn me

Said I'm with you, you're with me
Honey, we're going down in history 
We're going down 
Blow my cool, bite my lip
See me through on my death trip
Free this slave, hear me sing
You can save me, everything

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me 
I say I'll stick you, you stick me
Say I'll rip you, you rip me
