Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah, oh
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah


The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah (uhuhuh)
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah
In this town called Malice, uhuh-yeah
 
Some people might say my life is in a rut
I'm quite happy with what I got
People might say that I should strive for more
But I'm so happy I can't see the point

Something's happening here today
A show of strength with your boy's brigade
And I'm so happy and you're so kind
You want more money - of course, I don't mind
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes
And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got

I'm going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

Some people might get some pleasure out of hate
Me, I've enough already on my plate
People might need some tension to relax
Me, I'm too busy dodging between the flak

What you see is what you get
You made your bed, you better lie in it
You choose your leaders and place your trust
As their lies puts you down and their promises rust
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns
And the public wants what the public gets
But I don't get what this society wants

I'm going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
So let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

We talk and we talk until my head explodes
I turn on the news and my body froze
These braying sheep on my TV screen
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!

Going underground
I'm going underground

I'm going underground
I'm going underground
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

These braying sheep on my TV screen
Make this boy shout, make this boy scream!

Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet go pound, pound, pound
Going underground (going underground)
So let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow
 
A police car and a screaming siren
Pneumatic drill and ripped-up concrete
A baby wailing, a stray dog howling
The screech of brakes and lamplight blinking
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
An electric train and a ripped-up phone booth
Paint-splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
Lights going out and a kick in the balls
I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
Days of speed and slow-time Mondays
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
Watching the news and not eating your tea
A freezing cold flat with damp on the walls
I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la
La la la la la
Waking up at 6 A.M. on a cool warm morning
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la
Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
Getting a cab and travelling on buses
Reading the grafitti about slashed-seat affairs
I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah
 
The distant echo -
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps - repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrapers and this morning's papers
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow - they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change - and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows - gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
"Hey boy" they shout "have you got any money?"
And I said "I've a little money and a take away curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork"
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight
The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was "Jesus Saves" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read "Have an Awayday - a cheap holiday - Do it today!"
I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
Cause they took the keys - and she'll think it's me
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight
 
Sup up your beer and collect your fags
There's a row going on down near Slough
Get out your mat and pray to the West
I'll get out mine and pray for myself
Thought you were smart when you took them on
But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?
Hello-hurray, what a nice day
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I hope rain stops play
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse
Tore down the House of Commons in your brand new shoes
Composed a revolutionary symphony
Then went to bed with a charming young thing
Hello-hurray, cheers then, mate
It's the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, an extremist scrape
With the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a guilty schoolboy
What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a naughty schoolboy
We came out of it naturally the worst
Beaten and bloody, and I was sick down my shirt
We were no match for their untamed wit
Though some of the lads said they'd be back next week
Hello-hurray, it's the price to pay
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I'd prefer the plague
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, it's the price to pay
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I'd prefer the plague
To the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
 
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English rose
For no bonds can ever tempt me from she
I've sailed the seven seas
Flown the whole blue sky
But I've returned with haste to where my
Love does lie
No matter where I go I will come back to my English Rose
For nothing can ever tempt me from she
I've searched the secret mists -
I've climbed the highest peaks
Caught the wild wind home
To hear her soft voice speak
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English Rose
For no bonds can ever keep me from she
I've been to ancient worlds
I've scoured the whole universe
And caught the first train home
To be at her side
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English Rose
For no bonds, nothing and no-one can ever keep me from she
 
In the city there's a thousand things I want to say to you
But whenever I approach you
You make me look a fool
I wanna say
I wanna tell you
About the young ideas
But you turn them into fears
In the city there's a thousand faces all shining bright
And those golden faces are under 25
They wanna say
They gonna tell ya
About the young idea
You better listen now you've said your bit-a
And I know what you're thinking
You're sick of that kind of crap
But you'd better listen man
Because the kids know where it's at
In the city there's a thousand men in uniforms
And I've heard they now have the right to kill a man
We wanna say, we gonna tell ya
About the young idea
And if it don't work, at least we still tried
In the city, in the city
In the city
In the city
In the city there's a thousand things I want to say to you
 
It's not important for you to know my name
Nor I to know yours
If we communicate for two minutes only
It will be enough
For knowing that someone in this world
Feels as desperate as me
And what you give is what you get
It doesn't matter if we never meet again
What we have said will always remain
If we get through for two minutes only
It will be a start!
For knowing that someone in this life
Loves with a passion called hate
And what you give is what you get
If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you again
If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you again
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
 
In your white lace and your wedding bells
You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the on-looking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows
When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill
Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken dawn, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else
For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!
 
Life is timeless, days are long when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone
Any guitar and any bass drum
Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young
Life is new and there's things to be done
You can't wait to be grown up
Acceptance into the capital world
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young
But you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to comprehend
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end
But you don't mind you've got time on your side
And they're never gonna make you stand in line
You're just waiting for the right time
You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young
You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone
No corporations for the new age sons
Tears of rage roll down your face
But still you say "it's fun"
And you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to understand
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam
It's got you in its grip before you're born
It's done with the use of a dice and a board
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn
You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone
Any guitar and any bass drum
 
Beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
All the things that I care about
(Are packed into one punch)
All the things that I'm not sure about
(Are sorted out at once)
And as it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
That bullshit is bullshit
It just goes by different names
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
All the things that I shout about
(But never act upon)
All the courage and the dreams I have
(But seem to wait so long)
My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
And if you feel there's no passion
No quality sensation
Seize the young determination
Show the fakers you ain't foolin'
You'll see me come runnin'
To the sound of your strummin'
Fill my heart with joy and gladness
I've lived too long in the shadows of sadness
My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Wake me up with your amphetamine blast
Take me by the collar, throw me out into the world
Rock me gently and send me dreaming of something tender
I was brought here to pay homage
To the Beat Surrender
 
Found myself in a strange town
Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street
I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
But when you ask in a strange town
They say don't know, don't care
And I've got to go, mate
They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs
You've got to move in a straight line
You've got to walk and talk in four four time
You can't be weird in a strange town
You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners
You've got to wear the right clothes
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose
You can't be nice in a strange town
Cause we don't know, don't care
And we got to go, man
Rush my money to the record shops
I stop off in a back street
Buy myself a snort
We got our own manifesto
Be kind to queers
And I'm so glad the revolution's here
It's nice and warm now!
I've finished with clubs where the music's loud
Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd
There's no one there
I look in the mirror
But I can't be seen
Just a thin, clean layer of Mister Sheen
Looking back at me
Oh, oh
Found myself in a strange town
Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street
I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
They say don't know, don't care
And I've got to go, mate
They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs
Strange town
Break it up
Burn it down, shake it up
Break it up
 
Seen you before, I know your sort
You think the world awaits your every breath
You'll be my friend, or so you say
You'll help me out when the time comes
And all the time we're getting rich
You hang around to help me out
But when we're skint, oh God forbid!
You drop us like hot bricks
Artistic freedom, do what you want
But just make sure that the money ain't gone
I'll tell you what, I got you sussed
You'll waste my time, when my time comes
 
Why are you frightened - can't you see that it's you
That ain't no ghost - it's a reflection of you
Why do you turn away - an' keep it out of sight
Oh - don't live up to your given roles
There's more inside you that you won't show
But you keep it hidden just like everyone
You're scared to show you care - it'll make you vulnerable
So you wear that ghost around you for disguise
But there's no need just 'cos it's all we've known
There's more inside you that you haven't shown
So keep on moving, moving, moving your feet
Keep on shuf-shuf-shuffling to this ghost dance beat
Just keep on walking down never ending streets
One day you'll walk right out of this life
And then you'll wonder why you didn't try
To spread some loving all around
Old fashioned causes like that still stand
Gotta rid this prejudice that ties you down
How do you feel at the end of the day
Just like you've walked over your own grave
So why are you frightened - can't you see that it's you
At the moment there's nothing - so there's nothing to lose
Lift up your lonely heart and walk right on through
 
This is a modern world
This is the modern world

What kind of fool do you think I am?
You think I know nothing of the modern world
All my life has been the same
I've learned to live by hate and pain
It's my inspiration drive

I've learned more than you'll ever know
Even at school I felt quite sure
That one day I would be on top
And I'd look down upon the map
The teachers who said I'd be nothing
Hey!

This is the modern world that I've learned about
This is the modern world
We don't need no one to tell us what's right or wrong
This is the modern world!

Say what you like 'cause I don't care
I know where I am and going to
It's somewhere I won't preview
Don't have to explain myself to you
I don't give two fucks about your review

This is the modern world that I've learned about
This is the modern world
We don't need no one to tell us what's right or wrong
Modern world, this is, this is, this is, this is
This is, this is, this is
Hey, we don't need no one to tell us what's right or wrong

Ah...
This is a modern world
This is the modern world
 
It's funny how you never knew what my name was
Our only contact was a form for the election
These days I find that I don't listen
These days I find that we're out of touch
These days I find that I'm too busy
So why the attention, now you want my assistance
What have you done for me?
You've gone and got yourself in trouble
Now you want me to help you out
These days I find that I can't be bothered
These days I find that it's all too much
To pick up a gun and shoot a stranger
But I've got no choice so here I come
War games
I'm up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers
Reconnaissance duty up at 5:30
Shoot, shoot, shoot and kill the natives
You're one of us and we love you for that
Think of honour, Queen and country
You're a blessed son of the British Empire
God's on our side and so is Washington
Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers
Come up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers
Come out on the hills, playing little boy soldiers
Come on outside - I'll sing you a lullaby
Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed
We ruled the world, we killed and robbed
The fucking lot - but we don't feel bad
It was done beneath the flag of democracy
You'll believe and I do - yes I do, yes I do
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
These days I find that I can't be bothered
To argue with them, well what's the point?
Better to take your shots and drop down dead
Then they send you home in a pine overcoat
With a letter to your mum
Saying find enclosed one son, one medal and a note
To say he won
 
Daylight dawns, you wake up and yawn, Mr. Clean
A piece of toast from the one you love most, and you leave
You catch your bus in the 8 o'clock rush
And catch your train in the morning rain
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
If you see me in the street, look away
'Cause I don't ever want to catch you looking at me, Mr. Clean
'Cause I hate you and your wife
And if I get the chance I'll fuck up your life
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
Is that seen?
Surround yourself with dreams
Of pretty young girls, and anyone you want, but
Please don't forget me or any of my kind
'Cause I'll make you think again
When I stick your face in the grind
Getting pissed at the annual office do
Smart blue suit and you went to Cambridge too
You miss page 3, but The Times is right for you
And mum and dad are very proud of you
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean
 
Puts up the closed sign does the man in the corner shop
Serves his last and says goodbye to him
He knows it is a hard life
But it's nice to be your own boss, really
Walks off home does the last customer
He's jealous of the man in the corner shop
He's sick of working at the factory
Says it must be nice to be your own boss, really
La la la la la...
Sells cigars to the boss from the factory
He is jealous is the man in the corner shop
He is sick of struggling so hard
He says it must be nice to own a factory
Go to church do the people from the area
All shapes and classes sit and pray together
For here they are all one
For God created all men equal
La la la la la...
Go to church do the people from the area
Go to church do the people from the area
Go to church do the people from the area
For God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know
La la la la la...
 
Times were so tough, but not as tough as they are now
We were so close and nothing came between us and the world
No personal situations
Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole the friendship that bound us together
We stole from the schools and their libraries
We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep
We stole from the drink that made us sick
We stole anything that we couldn't keep
And it was enough, we didn't have to spoil anything
And always be as thick as thieves
Like a perfect stranger, you came into my life
Then like the perfect lone ranger
You rode away, rode away, rode away, rode away
We stole the love from young girls in ivory towers
We stole autumn leaves and summer showers
We stole the silent wind that says you are free
We stole everything that we could see
But it wasn't enough - and now we've gone and spoiled everything
Now we're no longer as thick as thieves
You came into my life
Then like a perfect stranger
You walked away, walked away, walked away, walked away
Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole the friendship that bound us together
We stole the burning sun in the open sky
We stole the twinkling stars in the black night
We stole the green belt fields that made us believe
We stole everything that we could see
But something came along that changed our minds
I don't know what and I don't know why
But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time
While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind
No, we're no longer as thick as thieves - no
We're not as thick as we used to be, no
We're no longer as thick as thieves, no
We're not as thick as we used to be
No it wasn't enough
And we've gone and spoiled everything
Now we're no longer as thick as thieves

I am a dull and simple lad
Cannot tell water from champagne
And I have never met the Queen
And I wish I could have all he has got, oy

Wish I could be like David Watts
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
And lead the school team to victory
Take my exams, and pass the lot
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)  like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish I could have all he has got, oy

Wish I could be like David Watts
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best, but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts

Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
