How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today


I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)
 
Every time I think of you
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
But there's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
Well, every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself, that if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
 
Won't you please let me go
These words lie inside, they hurt me so
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
Just what you want me to

I saw you this morning
I thought that you might like to know
I received your message in full a few days ago
I understood every word that it said
And now that I've actually heard it
You're going to regret

And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what you want me to
You're not the kind that needs to tell me
About the birds and the bees


Do you find this happens all the time
Crucial point one day becomes a crime
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you

I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
 
This is why events unnerve me
They find it all, a different story
Notice whom for wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she ask's the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
Word will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and lean towards this time

Oh, I'll break them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time

Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever
 
I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning Sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
 
Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch
Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch
They think it's all over... well, it is now!

Express yourself, create the space
You know you can win, don't give up the chase
Beat the man, take him on
You never give up, it's one on one

(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good it's never gone

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

Now is the time, let everyone see
You never give up that's how it should be
Don't get caught make your own play
Express yourself don't give it away

(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) It's one on one
(Express yourself) You can't be wrong
(Express yourself) When something's good it's never gone

Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true
Love's got the world in motion
And I know what we can do
Love's got the world in motion
And I can't believe it's true

We want goals
A beauty scored by Bobby Charlton
We want goals

You've got to hold and give but do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast but you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you, defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them, get round the back
Catch me if you can, cause I'm the England man
And what you're looking at is the master plan
We ain't no hooligans, this ain't a football song
Three lions on my chest, I know we can't go wrong

We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
They think it's all over... well, it is now!
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
We're playing for England (En-ger-land)
We're playing this song
We're singing for England (En-ger-land)
Arrivederci, it's one on one
 
A heaven, a gateway, a hope
Just like a feeling I need, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to treat you this way
Betrayed by words I'd never heard, too hard to say

Oh, up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Each way I turn, I know I'll always try
To break this circle that has been placed around me
From time to time, I find I've lost some need
That was so urgent to myself, I do believe


Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got grey eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got grey eyes
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before
 
On a thousand islands in the sea
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
I watch them walking, falling in a row
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
There's a thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame

And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou

From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
To my teeth, through my nose
You get these words wrong
You get these words wrong
Every time
You get these words wrong
I just smile

But from my head to my toes
From my knees to my eyes
Every time I watch the sky
For these last few days leave me alone
But for these last few days leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
 
Maybe I've forgotten the name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known, it's nothing I regret
Save it for another day, it's the school exam
The kids have run away

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was upset, you see, almost all the time
You used to be a stranger, now you are mine

I wouldn't even trust you, I've not got much to give
We're dealing in the limits and we don't know who with
You may think that I'm out of hand, that I'm naive, I'll understand
On this occasion it's not true
Look at me, I'm not you

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was a short fuse burning all the time
You were a complete stranger, now you are mine

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain about my wounded heart

Just wait 'til tomorrow
I guess that's what they all say
Just before they fall apart
 
Oh I've just come
From the land of the sun
From a war that must be won
In the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave
Your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades
And some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe
The joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave
And I was going home
Oh I flew through the sky
My convictions could not lie
For my country I would die
And I will see it soon

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door
My wife she lay upon the floor
And with tears her eyes were sore
I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand
And I saw the telegram
That said that I was a brave, brave man
But that I was dead

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
 
A thought that never changes remains a stupid lie
It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no colors, just silence
Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care
Sound formed in a vacuum may seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no lyrics, just nothing
The sign that leads the way
The path we can not take
You've caught me at a bad time
So, why don't you piss off?
 
I stood there beside myself
Thinking hard about the weather
Then came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start:
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his gun
I said "let's go out and have some fun"

I know, you know, you believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

I have always thought about
Staying here and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun
I said "let's go out and have some fun"

I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love

When you are alone at night
You search yourself for all the things
That you believe are right
If you give it all away
You throw away your only chance to be here today
Then a fight breaks out on your street
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat
My friend, he took his final breath
Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death
 
My promise could be your fiend
A given end to your dreams
A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
In its escapable view
There's no escape, so few in fear
Give in a changing value

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
Hello, farewell to your love and soul
Hello, farewell to your soul

Now I know what those hands would do
No looking back now, we're pushing through
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste and see
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
 
What can you buy
That lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
What makes your day?
What miracle of life
Has come to stay?
A taste of love
So sweet, so real you can't let go
And how does it feel?
It feels so good...

But how much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?
How much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?

I want a nice car
A girlfriend
Who's as pretty as a star
I want respect
As much, as much as I can get

But how much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?
How much do you need?
How much, how much do you need?

Restless
I feel so restless
And in this changing world
I am lost for words
I feel so restless
Ain't got no interest
I couldn't care less
Can't be a success

Due to current studies
The fiscal climate isn't looking good
Get out of town
The streets are running rivers full of blood
The more I see
The less, the less that I believe
The more I hear
The less, the less that I perceive

Restless
I feel so restless
And in this changing world
I am lost for words
I feel so restless
Ain't got no interest
I couldn't care less
Can't be a success

What can you buy
That lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
What makes your day?
What miracle of life
Has come to stay?
A taste of love
So sweet, so real you can't let go
And how does it feel?
It feels so good...

Restless
I am so restless
And this changing world
Leaves me speechless
I am lost for words
But I kept my nerve
But it's not hopeless
If you take less
 
We're like crystal, we break easy
I'm a poor man, if you leave me
I'm applauded, then forgotten
It was summer, now it's autumn

I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core

We're like crystal, it's not easy
With your love, you could feed me
Every man, and every woman
Needs someone, So keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming

I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core

Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
 
Tutti frutti
Amore mio
Tutti frutti
No
Non è ancora il momento di entrare
Non è ancora il momento di…

Life is so crazy these days
I don't know how to adjust
Are we the master or slave?
Do we need passion or lust?
Are we just caught in a daze?
So many words in a phrase
Life is so crazy these days
Life is so crazy these days


You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
I'm paper in your hand
I'm under your command
And I'll never let you go
'Cause you're that girl
Tutti Frutti


I had a beautiful dream
For a picture so serene
But I don't know what it means - love
I just want your love
Generations lost in space
Trying to find the human race
We're living in a state of grace
Where every scholar means a dollar

And sometimes I just can't go on
I feel like I'm a setting sun
I know my eyes are burning bright
I just need you to make it right

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
I'm paper in your hand
I'm under your command
And I'll never let you go
'Cause you're that girl
Tutti Frutti

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
Whenever I feel low
Whenever I feel low
Whenever I feel low
'Cause you're that girl
Tutti Frutti

Non mi interessa il nome vero
Non mi interessa la vita reale
Quella canzone
E tu? Sei tutti frutti
 
Winter came so soon
Like summer never happened
We're players on a stage
With roles already scripted
We're working for a wage
I'm living for today
On a giant piece of dirt
Spinning in the universe

I can hear your cry out there
And I can feel you close to me

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
For friends not here
We shed our tears

And all I wanna do
Is make the right impression
The instrument of truth
A soldier with no weapons
I care so much for you
I'd crawl a thousand miles
Through deserts full of sand
My love in every land

I can hear your cry out there
And I can feel you everywhere

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
For friends not here
We shed our tears
One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
For friends not here
We shed our tears

I can feel your presence here
Tender softly through the air

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
 
When a new life turns towards you
And the night becomes the day
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets this way

Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours, ooh oh

When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives

Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth

I am still here two days later
Same place, same time
And I'm stuck here two years too long
Same place, the wrong time

Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The sun, the sea and the hours

Their love died three years ago
Spoken words I cannot show
 
I like walking in the park
When it gets late at night
I move round in the dark
And leave when it gets light
I sit around by day
Tied up in chains so tight
These crazy words of mine
So wrong they could be right

What do I get out of this?
I always try, I always miss
One of these days you'll go back to your home
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of these days when you sit by yourself
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
It's got to hurt you a little bit

I like talking in my sleep
When people work so hard
They need what they can't keep
A choice that leaves them scarred
A view without a room
Unveils the truth so soon
And when the sun goes down
You've lost what you have found

What do I get out of this?
I always try, I always miss
One of these days you'll go back to your home
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of these days when you sit by yourself
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
It's got to hurt you a little bit


What do I get out of this?
I always try, I always miss
One of these days you'll go back to your home
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of these days when you sit by yourself
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
It's got to hurt you a little bit
What do I get out of this?
I always try, I always miss
One of these days you'll go back to your home
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of these days when you sit by yourself
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
It's got to hurt you a little bit
What do I get out of this?
I always try, I always miss
One of these days you'll go back to your home
You won't even notice that you are alone
 
I've watched your face for a long time
It's always the same
I've studied the cracks and the wrinkles
You were always so vain
But now you live your life like a shadow
In the pouring rain
Oh, it's called love
Yes, it's called love
Oh, it's called love
And it belongs to us
Oh, it dies so quickly, it grows so slowly
But when it dies, it dies for good
It's called love
And it belongs to everyone but us
I've lived my life in the valleys
I've lived my life on the hills
I've lived my life on alcohol
I've lived my life on pills
But it's called love
And it belongs to us
It's called love
And it's the only thing that's worth living for
It's called love
And it belongs to us
It's called love
Yes, it's called love
Oh, love is found in the east and the west
But when love is at home, it's the best
Love is the cure for every evil
Love is the air that supports the eagle
It's called love
And it's so uncool
It's called love
And somehow it's become unmentionable
It's called love
And it belongs to everyone of us
It's called love
And it cuts your life like a broken knife, no
Love, love, love love love
It's called love and it belongs to us
It's called love, love, love love love
It's called love and it belongs to everyone but us
