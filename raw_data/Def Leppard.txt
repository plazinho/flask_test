If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

I don't want to touch you too much, baby

So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it

It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies

Love begs, love pleads

You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it
But are you getting it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?

Then play it pretty with a pat on the back



Yeah, but are you getting it?

Ooh, really getting it?

Lady luck never smiles
So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill
On and on we rode the storm
The flame has died and the fire has gone
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago

Is anybody out there, anybody there?
Does anybody wonder, anybody care?
Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there and you really care
Because baby I'm not
Fooling, ah fooling, fooling, ah fooling
Won't you stay with me awhile?

Close your eyes don't run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just waking up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad

I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl, for the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall, but I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby, united we fall

Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I can't fight this flame
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby, like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes
There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know got to win this time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby...Crazy...Crazy

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
If you have a heart at all
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collideEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Walk away if you want to
It's ok, if you need to
You can run, but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind

Take the time
To think about it
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

There's a magic running through your soul
But you, you can't have it all
(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind
Two steps behind
Yeah, baby
Two steps behind
Ohh, sugar
Two steps behind2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In the beginning, God made the land
Then he made the water and creatures, then he made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild, one part lady, one part child

I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them

And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild

I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
Skin on skin
Let the love begin
Women

It was one part love, one part wild
One part lover, one part child
A whole lot of fire, a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you can't sacrifice

(I give you) Hair, eyes, skin on skin
(Legs) Legs
(Thighs) Thighs
What's that spell? (Spell, what's that spell?)
(What's that spell?) What's that spell?
(What's that spell?) (Women, women)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(Women) Women
(Women) Calling every girl
(Women, women) All around the world

Do you wanna get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
"Get your butt right out of bed"
Stop bugging me
"Get up and move your sleepy head"
Don't shake my tree
He said, "Mow the lawn", who me?
"Walk the dog", not my style, man
"Take out the trash", no way
"Tidy your room", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialing through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Hey, all I want to do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Somewhere in the distance
I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town
As the children start to sing
And the lady across the street
She shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting
As she turns out the light
But it's too late
Too late
Too late
Too late for love
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
London boys are gazing
Girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence
Their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream
Stands before them all
She stretches out her hand
As the curtains start to fall
But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late
Standing by the trapdoor, aware of me and you
Are the actor and the clown, they're waiting for their cue
And there's a lady over there, she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life, she always plays the fool

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

Is it all too late?
Much too late?
Can't you see it's all too late?
Yeah, it's too late

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late
But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Some kinda rash and reckless scene
To give out such crazy love

And if my time don't ever come
For me you're still the one
Damned if I don't, damned if I do
I got to get a fix on you

Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have

I don't need it
I don't need it
I don't need your understandingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Feeling like it's all over
Feeling like there's no love
Feeling like it's not easy
Breathing life in the dust

On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't going to be heroes
There ain't going to be anything, oh

Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

When we all fall down
When we walk into silence
When we shadow the sun
When we surrender to violence, oh
Then the damage is done
Put away that gun
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be anywhere, oh
Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

We're fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for?
We're fighting with the Gods of war but I'm a rebel
And I ain't going to fight no more, no way

On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There ain't going to be heroes
There ain't going to be anything, oh

Here it comes, here comes the night
Here it comes, hell in the night
Here it comes, here comes the night

We're fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for?
We're fighting with the Gods of war
And I ain't going to fight no more
(Stop)
Stop fighting for the Gods of war
(Stop fighting for the Gods of war)
Yeah what the hell we fighting for?
(What in the hell we fighting for?)
We're fighting with the Gods of war
Heavy!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Billy's got a gun, he's on the run
Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind
Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's going to shoot you down
He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise
There's danger in the air

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

Oh, he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for, in a world of black and white
They were wrong and he was right
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true
He's going underground to track that danger down
Oh, Billy, and why you got that gun?

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)
Never give him an even break
Getting caught is the chance you take
It could be your last mistake
(You could be so hopeless)
As a bird with a broken wing
Like a sheep in a lions den
Going to fall but you won't know when
(He's going to get you)

You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall
And the ghostly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder but the lightning was too late
As the rain came down on the crimson ground was the hand of fate
And a crowd of people gathered around but Billy couldn't wait

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

(Aah, you better run) Never give him an even break
(Better run) Getting caught is the chance you take
(You better run) It could be your last mistake
(Yeah, Billy's got a gun)
As a bird with a broken wing (Oh, Billy)
As a sheep in the lions den (Oh, Billy)
Going to fall but you won't know when
(Yeah, the heat is on, he's going to get you)
Bang, bangEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
