Heto mi halanma
Mine waddimi yiddema
Ko ane tane holimi
Holimi ko ndjidirmi o Dunne Dunne
Hum hum waddimi yidde

In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have

Humm ko ane holimi
Koliyo ngopei ndjoukirade
Hasidagal modiani
Waddimi yiddema
Waddimi yiddema
Mine waddimi yiddema
Ko ane tane rokimi
Ko nanei nanei nanei nanei nanei mi waddno
Ko jonni jonni jonni jonni jonni mi watti
Ko jonni jonni jonni jonni jonni mi watti

So open up my eyes to a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night
But I lift up my eyes to a new high
And indeed there would be time

In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have
In the cold light I live, I only live for you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

There is a time, a time to love
A time to sing, a time to shine
A time to leave, a time to stay
There is a time, a time to cry
A time to love, a time to live
There is a time, a time to sing
A time to love

And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?
 
Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my

Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

Haa-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?
 
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again
 
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground

Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
 
1, 2, 3

All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright

But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you

But don’t just slip away in the night
And don’t just hurl your words from on high

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don’t just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

If we come back and we’re broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we’ll go your way

'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
 
You hold it, in your hands
And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again
Alone, In the compromise of truth

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you leave it open?

And the stakes remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don’t leave a love divine
Its a water tight excuse

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you will always be danger

How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit that greets you in the night
With snake eyes, the most precious kind

It's in the eyes!
I can tell, you will always be danger!
We had it tonight! Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes!
I can tell you will always be danger!
 
And after the storm
I run and run as the rains come
And I look up, I look up
On my knees and out of luck
I look up
Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot

And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall
And remembered our own land
What we lived for

But there will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair

And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more
That's why I hold
That's why I hold with all I have
That's why I hold

And I won't die alone
And be left there
Well I guess I'll just go home
Oh God knows where
Because death is just so full
And man so small
Well I'm scared of what's behind
And what's before

There will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
And there will come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
 
Woman
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

And I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again

I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time, oh-oh-ohh
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again, oh-oh-ohh
I am left in awe of the woman I adore

Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

But say the sun doesn't shine for you
I hope you learn that that's not true, in time
When you're gone again
Just as long again

I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again
But I am left in awe of the woman I adore
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
But as the night ascends, all will slow again
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore
 
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body?
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly?
And can you kneel before the king
And say, "I'm clean, I'm clean"?

But tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention
But denied my affections, my affections

So tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

Lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Oh, lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Har, har, har, har, har
Har, har, har...
 
It's in my blood, it's in my water
You tried to tame me, tame me from the start
With that deadness in your eye, flash your flesh
Desperate for a need to rise

With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
And the place looks safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind

You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love if you want

Beholden now, I find myself awake
Waiting on the edge again
You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends

With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
And the place looks safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind

You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love if you want

But I thought we believed in an endless love
But I thought we believed in an endless love
 
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Preset all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind


Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Lest you want to move away
From the noise of this place

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
 
Serve God, love me and mend
This is not the end
Live unbruised, we are friends
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Sigh no more, no more
One foot in sea, one on shore
My heart was never pure
You know me, you know me

But man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing

Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
 
Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet
 
Wide eyed, with a heart made full of fright
Your eyes follow like tracers in the night
And the tightrope that you wander every time
You have been weighed, you have been found wanting

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for


Shelter, you better keep the wolf back from the door
He wanders ever closer every night
And how he waits, baying for blood
I promised you everything would be fine

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for


Hold my gaze, love, you know I want to let it go
We will stare down at the wonder of it all
And I will hold you in it
And I will hold you in it

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to look you in the eye
'Cause you were all I ever longed for

Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
 
Oh babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
And oh babe, can you tell what’s on my tongue?
Can you guess that I’ll be gone with the twilight?
With the twilight

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No, they don't, they say they don't

Oh babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you lie
One last time
Just one last time
But oh, babe, I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand

But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No, they don't, they say they don't
And we can talk it 'round again, girl
'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round again
Or we could leave it out tonight
Leave it out, just leave it out

I never tried to trick you, babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just wanna hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind


But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No, they don't, they say they don't
 
And in time
As one reminds the other of the past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?
A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time
And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you

Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one

Careful hands
And wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
And now I'm losing you
 
Do not lie to us
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
Tell your stories, tell of your pain
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep

But what have I if I have not love?
I am a waste
My words are empty vessels if I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me I think we'll find a way
And walk with me I think we'll find a way

But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
What's behind, I can clearly see
But that beyond, that's beyond me

When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
And does your love prefer the other?
And does your love just make you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?

When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
When it's all just dust to dust
And how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me

Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?

When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
 
Touch my mouth and hold my tongue
I’ll never be your chosen one
I’ll be home, safe and tucked away
You can’t tempt me if I don’t see the day
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
Stifles the choice and the air in my lungs
Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
Cause when I open my body I breathe a lie
I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot
And oh, my heart was flawed I knew my weakness
So hold my hand, consign me not to darkness
So crawl on my belly ‘til the sun goes down
I’ll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I can take the road and I can fuck it all away
But in this twilight, our choices seal our fate
 
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

Awake my soul
Awake my soul

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love
You invest your life

Yeah
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker
 
You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under
