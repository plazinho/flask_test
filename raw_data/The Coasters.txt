Take out the papers and the trash
Or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor
You ain't gonna rock and roll no more
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's hip; he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside
You ain't got time to take a ride
Yakety yak (don't talk back)
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
Yakety yak, yakety yak
 
Down in Mexicali
There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce
And the boss is a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said "Tell me, man, when does the fun begin?"
He just winked his eye and said, "Man, be cool"

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

In Mexico
All of a sudden in walks a chick
In Mexico
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick
In Mexico
Around her waist she wore three fishnets
In Mexico
She started dancin' with the castanets
In Mexico
I didn't know just what to expect
In Mexico
She threw her arms around my neck
In Mexico
We started dancin' all around the floor
In Mexico
And then she did a dance I never saw before
So if you're south of the border
I mean down in the Mexico
And you wanna get straight, man, don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Hey, como est usted senorita
Come with me to Mexico City
You can get your kicks in Mexico
Hahaha, crazy. Come with me, baby. Come with me
Ah we can watch the bull fights together
Come with me, senorita. yeah... yeah...
 
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
A pretty woman makes her husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he marries her, then she starts
To do the things that will break his heart
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks her meals on time
She'll always give you peace of mind
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Don't let your friends say
You have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly
Her eyes don't match
Take it from me she's a better catch
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Say man
Hey baby
I saw your wife the other day
Yeah?
Yeah, she's ugly
Man, she's ugly but she sure can cook, baby
Yeah? Alright...
If you wanna be happy
For the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy

(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)
(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)

One day while I was eatin' beans (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
Just sittin', diggin' all the scenes (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
A chick came walkin' through the door, that I had never seen before
At least I never saw her down (At Smokey Joe's Cafe) whoa
And I started shakin' when she sat right down next to me, whoa

Her knees were almost touchin' mine (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
A chill was runnin' down my spine (At Smokey Joe's Cafe) ooh-ooh
I could smell her sweet perfume, she smiled at me, my heart went boom
And everybody in the room at Smokey Joe's Cafe
They said, "Man, be careful! That chick belongs to Smokey Joe"

From behind the counter I saw a man
A chef hat on his head and a knife in his hand
He grabbed me by my collar and began to shout
"You'd better eat up all your beans and, boy, then clear right on out!"

Yes, I know I'll never eat again (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
And so we'll never meet again (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
I'd rather eat my chili beans at Jim's or Jack's or John's or Gene's
Than take my chances eatin' down (At Smokey Joe's Cafe)
Whoa, I risk my life with that Smokey Joe, the crazy fool


(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)
(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)
(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe)
(Wah, ah, at Smokey Joe's Cafe) Mm, mm-mm
 
Three cool cats, three cool cats
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car
Dividing up a nickel candy bar
Talking all about how sharp they are, these
Three cool cats
Three cool chicks, three cool chicks
Walkin' down the street swingin' their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
And three cool cats did three big flips for
Three cool chicks
Up popped the first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"I want this middle chick!"
"I want that little chick!"
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"
Three cool chicks, three cool chicks
They look like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
And three cool chicks made three fools of these
Three cool cats
Three cool cats, three cool cats, three cool cats
Three cool cats
 
(Spoken intro)
Who's that I see walkin' in the woods? Why, it's Little Red Riding Hood!
(Song)
Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are looking good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Listen to me
Little Red Riding Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walking in these spooky old woods alone
Ooooowww!
What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought to walk with you for a ways
What full lips you have
They're sure to lure someone bad
So until you get to grandma's place
I think you ought to walk with me and be safe
I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walking with you alone
Ooooowww!
Little Red Riding Hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf so I won't
Ooooowww!
What a big heart I have
The better to love you with
Little Red Riding Hood
Even bad wolves can be good
I'll try to be satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to grandma's place
Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are looking good
You're everything that a big bad wolf could want
Ooooowww!
(Spoken outro)
I mean baa! Baa? Baa!
 
I went and bought myself a ticket and
I sat down in the very first row, wo wo
They pulled the curtain but then when
They turned the spotlight way down low, wo wo
Little Egypt came out strotting
Wearing nothing but a button and a bow, wo wo
Singing, Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!
She had a ruby on her tummy and
A diamond big as Texas on her toe, wo wo
She let her hair down and
She did the hoochie koochie real slow, wo wo
When she did her special number on a zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show, wo wo
Singing, Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!
She did a triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Saying Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty-nine
Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore, wo wo
She's too busy mopping and
A taking care of shopping at the store, wo wo
'Cause we got seven kids and
All day long they crawl around the floor, wo wo
Singing, Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!
 
I saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin:
Look a-there! Look a-there!
Look a-there! Look a-there!
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered:
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
What crazy stuff! She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin':
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one!
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
 
I was walkin' down the street, mindin' my own affairs
When two policemen grabbed me, uh, unawares
He said, "Is your name Henry?" I said, "Why, sure"
They say, "You the boy we've been lookin' for"

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

They put me in the line up and let the bright lights shine
There were ten poor souls like me standing in that line
I knew I was a victim of someone's evil plan
When a stool pidgeon walked in and said, uh, "That's the man"

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

The prosecuting attorney started prosecutin' me
Man, that cat gave me the third degree
He said, "Where were you the night of, uh, June 29th?"
I said, "I was home in bed" he said, "Judge, this man is lying"

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

I deny the charges of robbing the liquor store
Deny the charges of carrying a .44
Deny the charges of vagrancy too
But when the judge came down
Poured whiskey on my head
Turned around to the jury and said
"Convict this man, he is drunk"
What could I do?

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

He was framed (I was framed)
He was framed (I was framed)
He was framed (I got framed)
 
I flopped down in my easy chair and turned on channel 2
A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was a-chasin' poor sweet Sue
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh
"If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'll saw you all in half"
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He turned on the buzz saw (And then? And then?)
Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall, thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones
Commercial came on, so I got up to get myself a snack
You should've seen what was going on by the time that I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine, sweet Sue was a-havin' fits
That villain said, "Give me the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits"
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (And then? And then?)
Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall, thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones
I got so bugged, I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was a-tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said, "If you don't give me the deed to your ranch, I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track"
And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He threw her on the railroad track (And then?)
A train started coming (And then? And then?)
Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall, thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones
Along came lonely, lanky Jones

Picking up cans, I said, "Side by side
Why don't you swing down sweet garbage truck?
And let your buddy ride"
Why don't you wake me, shake me?

(Serve it up)
I took my troubles
Down to Madame Ruth
(And drink it down)
You know that gypsy
With the gold-capped tooth
She's got a storefront
At Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Selling little bottles of
Love potion number nine
(Serve it up)
Love potion number nine
(And drink it down)
(Serve it up)
I told her that I
Was a flop with chicks
(And drink it down)
I've been that way
Since 1966
She looked at my palm
And she made a magic sign
She said, what you need is
Love potion number nine
(Serve it up)
Love potion number nine
(And drink it down)
She bent down and turned
Around and gave me a wink
She said, I'm gonna mix it up
Right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine
And looked like Indian ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes
I took a drink
(Serve it up)
I didn't know if
It was day or night
(And drink it down)
I started kissing
Everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop
Down at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottles of
Love potion number nine
(Serve it up)
Love potion number nine
(And drink it down)
Serve it up
And drink it down
Serve it up
And drink it down
Serve it up
And drink it down...
 
Oh, Red went and bought himself a monkey
Got him from a pawn shop broker
Taught that monkey how to guzzle beer
And he taught him out to play stud poker
Last night when they were gambling in the kitchen
The monkey he was taking a beating
The monkey said Red, "I'm going to shoot you dead
Because I know that well, you been a cheating."
Well, run Red run, because he's got your gun
And he's aiming it at your head
Run Red run, because he's got your gun
And he's aiming it at your head
You better get up and wail
You better move your tail before he fills it full of lead
Oh, Red jumped up and started to move like a P80-Saber Jet
He zoomed around the corner, and he disappeared
And everybody started to stare
The race was on, you know the chase was on
And Red he was all shook up
But, let me tell you sport, don't sell that monkey short
Because he's a travelling son of a gun
Well, run Red run, because he's got your gun
And he's aiming it at your head
Run Red run, because he's got your gun
And he's aiming it at your head
You better get up and wail
You better move your tail before he fills it full of lead
Monkey trapped Red in a parking alot
Down along the Avenue
Monkey said, "Red, you've made a man out of me
Now I'm going to make a monkey out of you
Give me your car keys, give me your wallet
Give it to me here, or I'll shoot
Going to put on your brand new Stetson hat
And go to town in your new brown suit."
Well, run Red run, because he's got your gun
And he's aiming it at your head
Run Red run, because he's got your gun
And he's aiming it at your head
You better get up and wail
You better move your tail before he fills it full of lead

And the boss is a cat named Joe
He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool pianna (to rhyme with "bandanna")
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said "Tell me man, when does the fun begin?"
He just winked his eye and said "Man, be cool."

In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black mustache

I heard the whistle blow then I heard somebody yell
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
There's a riot goin' on
Down in cell block number 9
The riot started down in cell block number 4

Pass the dynamite 'cause the fuse is lit

Down in cell block number 9
 
Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through
"I love you, love you"
I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody devine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again?
But keep repeating through and through
"I love you, love you"
I still recall the thrill, I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody devine
Zing! Oh, Oh, Oh went the strings of my heart
 
In the beginning, there weren't nothin' but rocks
Then somebody invented the wheel
And things just began to roll

Did you ever hear a tenor sax
Swingin' like a rusty axe?
Honkin' like a frog
Down in a hollow log?
Baby, that is rock and roll
Did you ever hear a guitar twang
Dingy, dingy, dingy, dang?
Ever hear those strings
Doin' crazy things?
Baby, that is rock and roll

That ain't no freight train that you hear
Rollin' down the railroad tracks
That's a country boy piano man
Playin' in between the cracks

You say that music's for the birds
And you can't understand the words
Well, honey, if you did
You'd really blow your lid
'Cause, baby, that is rock and roll

That ain't no freight train that you hear
Rollin' down the railroad tracks
That's a country boy piano man
Playin' in between the cracks

You say that music's for the birds
And you can't understand the words
Well, honey, if you did
You'd really blow your lid
'Cause, baby, that is rock and roll (in the mornin')
Baby, that is rock and roll (in the evenin')
Baby, that is rock and roll
