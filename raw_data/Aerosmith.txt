I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah!

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Every timeâ€‹ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away


Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today

There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me

Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me

'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me
Baby, baby, baby

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet
I was cryin' when I met you
 
Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this


Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Just give me a kiss
Like this
 
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

That kinda loving
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

Cause I'm going crazy

You turn it on

Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby

Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on, then your gone

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year


Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did


You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand

Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!

Janie got a gun

Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?

They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

She said, "'Cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same"

Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....

Ooo
Let go, let go, let go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't want to burn, I don't want to burn
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Yeah
 
I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home
Right!
Yeah yeah

Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty

Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer

Home sweet home

Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma she's a cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when boss man's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street

Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home

I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street
 
Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues

Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues

I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues


My girl don't go for smoking
And liquor just make her flinch
Seems she don't go for nothing
'Cept for my big 10 inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues
 
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

You think you're in love
Like it's a real sure thing
But every time you fall
You get your ass in a sling
You used to be strong
But now it's "ooh baby please"
Because falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid, he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone else's name
Yeah!

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

Chip off the old block
Man, you're so much like your sister
My fantasizin' must be outta luck
My old libido has been blowin' a transistor
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck, yeah

I'm jonesing on love
Yeah, I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
Yeah!

What are you looking for
It's got to be hardcore
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash
Own it own it own it


You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I'm good, but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

I'm jonesing on love
Yeah, I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
 
Yeah-yeah!

Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick

'Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said "You'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food"

Now they're smokin' up the jail bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!


Believe in all the good things that money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache from eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches, your inheritance won't last
So take your Grey Pompon my friend and shove it up your ass!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest!
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; don't stop me now I'm going crazy
Eat the rich; that's my idea of a good time baby
