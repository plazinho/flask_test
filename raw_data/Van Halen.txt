Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now

Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune, yeah!

Reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind

The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
Never losing sight, oh!
Well just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
