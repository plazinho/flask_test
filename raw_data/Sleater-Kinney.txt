In one more hour, I will be gone
In one more hour, I'll leave this room
The dress you wore, the pretty shoes
Are things I left behind for you

Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (You never wanted to let it let it go)

If you could talk, what would you say?
'Fore you things were just night and day
Take off the dress, take off the face
I'll hold you close before I leave

Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (It's so hard for you to say goodbye)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (You need a little bit, just a little more time)

Don't say another word
About the other girl
Don't say another word
About the other girl

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (Never wanted to let it, let it go)
 
My baby loves me, I'm so happy
Happy makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a TV
TV brings me closer to the world

My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day

My baby loves me, I'm so hungry
Hunger makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a donut
The hole's the size of this entire world

My whole life
Looks like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Looked like a picture of a sunny day

My baby loves me, I'm so angry
Anger makes me a modern girl
Took my money, I couldn't buy nothin'
I'm sick of this brave new world

My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
 
I spend the afternoon in cars
I sit in traffic jams for hours
Don't push me, I am not OK
The sky is blue most every day
The lemons grow like tumors, they—
Are tiny suns infused with sour

Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent

The only substance is the fog
And it hides all that has gone wrong
Can't see a thing inside the maze
There is a bridge adored and famed
The Golden spine of engineering
Whose back is heavy with my weight

Lonely as a cloud
In the Golden State
The coldest winter that I ever saw
Was the summer that I spent

Be still this old heart
Be still this old skin
Drink your last drink
Sin your last sin
Sing your last song
About the beginning
Sing it out loud
So the people can hear, let's go
Be still this sad day
Be still this sad year
Hope your last hope
Fear your last fear
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one, let's go

My falling shape will draw a line
Between the blue of sea and sky
I'm not a bird, I'm not a plane
I took a taxi to the Gate
I will not go to school again
Four seconds was the longest wait

Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest wait
Four seconds was the longest
 
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!

Atomic tourist
A life in search of power
I found my test site
I made a ritual of emptiness

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!

We walk to walk off
The edge of my own life
Doom Town, a bright flash
My body is a souvenir

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!

It took so long for me to see it
Hope’s a burden or it sets you free
Wandered through the void of you
Wandered through the void of me
I’ve grown afraid of everything that I love

There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
It's not the cities, it's the weather we love!
There are no cities, no cities to love
There are no cities, no cities to love
It's not the weather, it's the nothing we love!
It's not the weather, it's the people we love!
 
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out my head
What do you want, what do you know?
One to get started, three till we go

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

What do you want, what do you know?
Do you get nervous making me go?
Get into your sores, get into your things
Do you get nervous watching me bleed?

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin

I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows
Oh, God, let me in, there's nowhere else to go
Oh, God, let me in, and let me go, go, go, go

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin
 
Every day I throw a little party
But a fit would be more fitting, fitting
And every time I climb a little higher
Should I leap or go on living, living?
Hear the voices venomous and thrilling
In my head they're always calling, calling
But I wanna gotta go the way my blood beats
So I'm not fodder for their folly, folly

No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity

Let's destroy a room with this love
We can drain out all the power, power
Steal from the makers who unmade us
Leave them nothing to devour, devour

Well I am raw material
Make me plastic, make me fuel
I can be, I can be
I can be all

No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
No one here is taking notice
No outline will ever hold us
It's not a new wave, it's just you and me
Eyes are the only witness
Die to prove we ever lived this
Invent our own kind of obscurity
 
So you want to be entertained?
Please look away, don't look away
We're not here cause we want to entertain
Go away, don't go away
Reality is the new fiction they say
Truth is truer these days, truth is man-made
If you're here cause you want to be entertained
Go away, please go away

(Woah, oh, oh) If your art is done
(Woah, oh, oh) Johnny get your gun
(Woah, oh, oh) Join the rank and file
(Woah, oh, oh) On your TV dial

You come around looking 1984
You're such a bore, 1984
Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore
It's better than before
It's better than before
You come around sounding 1972
You did nothing new with 1972
Where's the "fuck you"?
Where's the black and blue
Where's the black and blue
Where's the black and blue

Hey! Look around they are lying to you

One, two, three!
Baby, I've had all my shots and I'm fine
One, two, three!
If you haven't had enough of me, get in line
One, two, three!
You too deserve it now, it's all right
One, two, three!
We can drown in mediocrity, it feels sublime
One, two, three!
It feels like someone pushed rewind
One, two, three!
Give it to me easily, my feeble mind needs time
One, two, three!
Make it sweet and syrupy with rhyme
Don't drag me down
I'm not falling down
Don't drag me down
I'm not falling down

(Woah, oh, oh) The grip of fear
(Woah, oh, oh) Is already here
(Woah, oh, oh) The lines are drawn
(Woah, oh, oh) Whose side are you on?
 
I'm a bubble in a sound wave
A sonic push for energy
Exploding like the sun
A flash of clean light hope
All you scientists can hold your breath
Can I decide to show myself, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(Take me to the source of chaos let me be the butterfly
Oh my, imperfect symmetry has underlying poetry in rhyme)
If you think like Thomas Edison
Could you invent a world for me
Now all that's on the surface
Are bloody arms and oil fields
Could I turn this place all upside down
And shake you and your fossils out, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(You can't predict everything with Newton like certainty, why
Oh my, coz it floats around all we see with oscillating energy on high)
And you soothe yourself with the sounds you know
You tune out out out the hypnotic drone
Perfect hexagon of the honeycomb
And you soothe your soul with the shapes you know
Should I come outside and run your cars
Should I run your rockets to the stars
Could you invent a world for me
I need to hear a symphony
If I'm to run the future
You've got to let the old world go, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(Take me to the source of chaos let me be the butterfly
Oh my, imperfect symmetry has underlying poetry in rhyme)
And you soothe yourself with the sounds you know
You tune out out out the hypnotic drone
Perfect hexagon of the honeycomb
And you soothe your soul with the shapes you know
Your word for me is fusion
But is real change an illusion
Could I turn this place all upside down
And shake you and your fossils out
If I'm to run the future
You've got to let the old world go
Could you invent a world for me
I need to hear a symphony, oh oh
Oh oh oh...
(You can't predict everything with Newton like certainty, why
Oh my, coz it floats around all we see with oscillating energy on high)
 
On the day the duck was born
The fox was watching all along
He said, "Land Ho!" when he saw the duck
"Land Ho!" and the duck saw him too
"Shiny Pretty Fox," thought the duck
The duck came up onto the land
The fox was watching and he just laughed
"I could show you some shiny tricks," he said
"Come along we'll get our kicks," he said
"Land Ho!" for shiny tricks
"Land Ho!" for me
"Oh Fox! Is this love? Can you tell me? What is love?"
That good looking fox only knew one trick
He could break hearts just lickety-split
The duck knew this game she had to quit
And her own pond she was headed too quick
"I'll go I'll go and there's no looking back"
Goodbye, little fox
Goodbye, my fox
 
It's fine when it's all mine
It's on my wall, it's in my head
Memorize it 'til I'm dead
It's yours, now, I'm so bored

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Joey Ramone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pictures of me on your bedroom door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Invite you back after the show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the queen of rock and roll

I just don't care
Are you that scared?
I swear they're looking right at me
Push to the front so I can see
It's what I thought
It's rock and roll

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Thurston Moore
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wrestle on your bedroom floor
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Always leave you wanting more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw away those old records

Go downtown
Put on your best frown
Give me a chance
I know I can dance

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be your Joey Ramone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pictures of me on your bedroom door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Invite you back after the show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the queen of rock and roll

I'm fine 'cause it's all mine
 
Hurry on home to me
I've set a place for two
Hurry on back to me
I've made my mood your mood
You know I'm dress downable, uptownable
Hair grabbable, grand slammable
Just hurry on home to me
'Cause it's just what we do

Disconnect me from my bones
So I can float, so I can roam
Disconnect me from my skin
Erase the marks, begin again

Hurry on home to me
I've been in bed since noon
Hurry on back to me
I've cleared out all the rooms
You know I'm unfuckable, unlovable
Unlistenable, unwatchable
But just hurry on home to me
I've made more space for you

Disconnect me from my bones
So I can float, so I can roam
Disconnect me from my skin
Erase the mark, begin again
Disconnect me from my bones
So I can float, so I can roam
Disconnect me from my skin
Erase the mark, begin again

Ah, ah, ah
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
You got me used to loving you
 
Today I am stitched, I am sewn
Patch me up, I've got want in my bones
Like some doll you thought you could throw away
I found my legs

Ready to climb out from under concrete
Only I get to be sickened by me
My body a smudge
Can't make out the details
Want to start over and come into being

Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
We're sick with worry
These nerve less days
We live on dread in our own gilded age

This dark world is precious to me
My scars make me breathe in so deep
My body has no need for sleep
This time around

Ready to find fragments of stillness
Only I get to be punished by me
Your voice is a crumb, it leads me from the wildness
Wanna start over, forget everything

Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
We're sick with worry
These nerve less days
We live on dread in our own gilded age

Make me a headline
I wanna be that bold
Make me a spotlight
So I can see the gold
Make me a headline
I wanna feel that bold
Make me a spotlight
So I can see the gold

Exhume our idols, bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
We're sick with worry
These nerve less days
We live on dread in our own gilded age

We speak in circles
We dance in code
Untame and hungry
On fire in the cold
Exhume our idols and bury our friends
We're wild and weary but we won't give in
 
Got this feeling when I heard your name the other day
Couldn't say it, couldn't make it go away
It's a hard place, can't be friends, we can't be enemies
It's just too much, feel the weight crushing down on my face

The hardest part is things already said
Getting better, worse, I can not tell
Why do good things never wanna stay?
Some things you lose, some things you give away

Broken pieces, try to make it good again
Is it worth it?
Will it make me sick today?
It's a dumb song, but I'll write it anyway
It's an old mistake, but we always make it, why do we?

The hardest part is things already said
Getting better, worse, I can not tell
Why do good things never wanna stay?
Some things you lose, some things you give away

This time, it'll be alright
This time, it'll be okay
This time, it'll be alright
This time, it'll be okay

The hardest part is things already said
Getting better, worse, I can not tell
Why do good things never wanna stay?
Some things you lose, some things you give away
Some things you lose, some things you give away
 
The bells go off
The buzzer coughs
The traffic starts to buzz
The clothes are stiff
The fabrics itch
The fit's a little rough
But I suck it in
To every stitch
Try to fit inside the glove
I scrambled eggs
For little legs
The day's off in a rush
It's 9 AM
We must clock in
The system waits for us
I stock the shelves, I work the rows
The product's all Iight up
If I could flip the switch
The system fix
I could move us to the top
The numbers roll, it's time to go
But never fast enough

We never really checked, we never checked the price tag
When the cost comes in, it's gonna be high
We love our bargains, we love the prices so low
With the good jobs gone, it's gonna be rough

In the market
The kids are starving
They reach for the good stuff
Let's stay off label
Just 'til we're able
To save a little up
The next big  win
The ship comes in
No more worry for us
Just keep moving
The wheels keep turning
It's time to go pay up

We never really checked, we never checked the price tag
When the cost comes in, it's gonna be high
We love our bargains, we love the prices so low
With the good jobs gone, it's gonna be rough

I was lured by the devil, I was lured by the cost
I was lured by the fear, that all we had was lost
I was blind by the money, I was numb from the greed
I'll take God when I'm ready
I'll choose sin 'till I leave

We never really checked, we never checked the price tag
When the cost comes in, it's gonna be high
I was lured by the devil, I was lured by the cost (We love our bargains, we love the prices so low)
With the good jobs gone, it's gonna be rough (I was lured by the fear, that all we had was lost)
 
Throw me a rope, give me a leg
I haven't seen daylight in what must be days
I took the long way down, lost track of myself
Confidence fell down the steepest of slopes
But if you get me a line, lend me an oar
I'll row you an ocean,  I could do more
I feel so much stronger now that you're here
We've got so much to do, let me make that clear

We win, we lose
Only together do we break the rules
We win, we lose
Only together do we make the rules

I'm breaking the surface, tasting the air
Reaching for things that I could never before
The anchor is heavy, I can't hold the weight
The guilt holds me down, won't let me be myself
Suck it all in, suck it all up
Let go of thoughts that are holding me back
I push twice as hard towards it you see
And the past falls away to the bottom of the deep

We win, we lose
Only together do we break the rules
We win, we lose
Only together do we make the rules


We win, we lose
Only together do we break the rules
We win, we lose
Only together do we make the rules

When we leave say goodbye to your old way of life
I can breathe way up high, now it’s our turn to fly
 
They want to socialize you
They want to purify you
They want to dignify and analyze and terrorize you

This is love and you can't make it
(Look out, they want what you know)
In a formula or shake me
(Steal a kid, break a heart, steal the show)
I'm your monster, I'm not like you
(Peel back the skin, see what's there)
All your life is written for you
(I'll never show you what's in here)

Your life is good for one thing
You're messing with what's sacred
They want to simplify your needs and likes
To sterilize you

This is love and you can't make it
(Don't need you to explain the pain)
In a formula or break it
(I can prove to you it's all fake)
I'm your monster, I'm just like you
(She's dead but she can stand and she can walk)
All my life is right before you
(Call the doctor, miracle, she can talk)

Call the doctor
(you)
Call the doctor
(are)
Call the doctor
(not)
Call the doctor
(me)
Call the doctor
(you)
Call the doctor
(are)
Call the doctor
(not)
Call the doctor
(me)

This is love and you can't break it
(This is not really me at all)
In a formula or make me
(Stunt girl, dance and twirl, watch me fall)
I'm no monster, I'm just like you
(Carbon copy, same body, different hearts)
All my life is right before me
(Can't tell anymore, the real parts)
 
Bearer of the flag from the beginning
Now, who would have believed this riot girl's a cynic?
But they took our ideas to their marketing stars
And now I'm spending all my days at girlpower.com
Trying to buy back a little piece of me
(Everywhere you go they say
"Hello, weren't you the one that sold your soul?"
Everywhere you go they say
"Oh no, weren't you the one that let us go?")

And I think that I sometimes might have wished
For something more than to be a size six
But now my inspiration rests
In between my beauty magazines and my credit card bills

I've been crawling up so long on your stairway to heaven
And now I no longer believe that I wanna get in
And will there always be concerts where women are raped?
Watch me make up my mind instead of my face
The number one must have is that we are safe
(Everywhere you go, teenage is the rage
Inside your pants and on the front page
Everywhere you look, it's die or be born
If you can't decide, it's your own war)

And I think that I sometimes must have wished
For something more than to be a size six
But now my inspiration rests
In between my beauty magazines and my credit card bills

No more
No more
No more

And for all the ladies out there
I wish we could write more than the next marketing bid
Culture is what we make it, yes it is
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time to invent
Invent, invent, invent
Invent
 
And when the body finally starts to let go
Let it all go at once
Not piece by piece
But like a whole bucket of stars
Dumped into the universe
Whoooh! Watch it go!
Good-bye small hands, good-bye small heart
Good-bye small head
My soul is climbing tree trunks
And swinging from every branch
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I am fine)
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I'm not fine)
Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?
Do you like fur
(I'm alright)
Do you wanna come over
Are we captive only for a short time
(I'm not right)
Is there splendor, I'm not ashamed
Desire shoots through me like birds singing
(The way you move no ocean's waves were ever as fluid)
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I am fine)
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
They're calling on me
(I'm not fine)
I hit the mark
I target moon, I target sky, I target sun
Fall down on the world
Fall down on the world
Fall down on the world before it falls on you
Like beggars, like dogs
Like whores, us all
(I'm alright)
Like beggars, like dogs
Like stars, us all
(I'm not right)
Shoot straight for my heart
(And when you were near no sky was ever quite so clear)
Shoot straight for my heart
Like stars, so small
Like us when we fall
(I am fine)
Like beggars, like whores
Like lovers
Oh, get up too far
Oh, get up too far
Like stars above
Look down so far
Like stars above
Look down at us all
 
If you're tired of the big so so
Get yourself into some self control
Play the game by putting on the brakes
Slow down and make less mistakes
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
The way I feel when you call my name
Makes me go crazy to sane
The way I feel when you're close to me
Finally not drifting out to sea
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
It's all in my pocket
(I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind)
I call it my rocket
(Come a little closer, hit the one, go sane)
Come on now, I wish you would
I'm the one who makes you feel good
Never mind those things they say
They don't know it, but I'm here to stay
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
 
Everyone I know is tired
But everyone I know is wired
To machines, it's obscene
I'll just scream 'til it don't hurt no more
Everyone I know is happy
But everyone I know is napping
Half the day thrown away
But I can't find the thrill anymore

Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on, I wanna go on
Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on at all

Everyone I know is funny
But jokes don't make us money
Sell our rage, buy and trade
But we still cry for free every day
Everyone I know is bored
But everyone I know is floored
Crawl around on the ground
Let the sound of your blood lead the way

Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on, I wanna go on
Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on at all

My desire is contagious
My desire is contagious
My desire is contagious
My desire is contagious
My desire is contagious
My desire is contagious

Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on, I wanna go on
Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on at all
Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on, I wanna go on
Maybe I'm not sure
I wanna go on at all
