Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (Black tie)

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Uh-huh
Top coat, top hat
And I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white glove
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

And a beautician at the wheel

Wearing spike-heel shoes

When you wake up in the morning
And the light is hurt your head
The first thing you do
When you get up out of bed
Is hit that streets a-runnin'
And try to beat the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Spied a little thing and
I followed her all night
In a funky fine Levi's and her
Sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut
That was sweet as molasses
But what really knocked
Me out was her cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now go out and get yourself
Some thick black frames
With the glass so dark
They won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you
Cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades
And cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Said, I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
If you believe like working hard all day
Just step in my shoes and take my pay

I was born my papa's son
When I hit the ground I was on the run
I had one glad hand and the other behind
You can have yours, just give me mine
When the hound dog barking
In the black of the night
Stick my hand in my pocket
Everything's all right

I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change

She's really upset with me again
I didn't give her what she likes
I don't know what to tell her
Don't know what to say
Everything got funky last night

She was really bombed
And I was really blown away
And when I asked her what she wanted
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She gets a charge out of being so weird
Digs getting downright strange
But I can keep a handle on anything
Just this side of deranged

She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace

But she won't let me use my passion
Unless it's in a limousine

She got me under pressure

She likes cocaine
And flipping out with great Danes
She's about all I can handle
It's too much for my brain

It's got me under pressure

I'm gonna give her a message
Here's what I'm gonna say:

I'm shuffling through the Texas sand
But my head's in Mississippi
I'm shuffling through the Texas sand
But my head's in Mississippi
The blues has got a hold of me
I believe I'm getting dizzy
 Help me now
I keep thinking 'bout that night in Memphis
Lord, I thought I was in Heaven
I keep thinking 'bout that night in Memphis
I thought I was in Heaven
But I was stumbling through the parking lot
Of an invisible 7-11
What was I doing out there?
Where's my head baby?
Somewhere in Mississippi

Last night I saw a cowgirl
She was floating across the ceiling
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl
She was floating across the ceiling
She was mumbling to some howling wolf
About some voodoo healing

If you're down in Acuna
And you ain't up to being alone
Don't spend all your money
On just any honey that's grown
Go find the Mexican blackbird
And send all your troubles back home

They all call her "Puta"
Cause no one really knows her name
She works the cantina
Dancin' and a-lovin's her trade
Her mama was Mez'can
And her daddy was the ace of spades
Oh, let's drive that old
Chrysler to Mexico, boy

Said, keep your hands on the wheel there
Oh, it sure is fine, isn't it?
Now, you got it
Hand me another one of them
Brews from back here
Oh, this is gonna be so good
She's hot as a pepper
But smooth as a Mexican brew
So head for the border
And put in an order or two
The Mexican blackbird
Will be there waiting for you
Oh, one more timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in
Go for a pallet that's so nice and thin
Zip it on around while it's on the ground
Spread it out and lay it on down

Slip inside my sleeping bag

You're afraid of the dark, baby, no need to be shy
We'll talk about some loving while we look at the sky
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright
We'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

Let's go out to Egypt because it's in the plan
Sleep beside the Pharaohs in the shifting sand
