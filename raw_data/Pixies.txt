Ooh—stop

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah (Yeah)
Your head will collapse, and there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
Bumped into me, I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse, and there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?

Hey
Been trying to meet you
Hey, must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at the door, whore in my bed

Outside there's a boxcar waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait till face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the boxcar waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Big shake on the boxcar moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

Ay-yeah

There was a god
An under water god who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge
From New York and New Jersey

This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven

The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole
Now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
And if the ground's not cold, everything is gonna burn
We'll all take turns, I'll get mine too

This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
This monkey's gone to Heaven
Rock me, Joe

If Man is five, If Man is five
If Man is five, then the Devil is six
Then the Devil is six, the Devil is six
The Devil is six, and if the Devil is six
Then God is seven, then God is seven
Then God is seven

And this I know, his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips she said
She said

Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball

Gigantic, gigantic
Gigantic, a big, big love

Lovely legs, they're a...
What a big black mess, what a hunk of love

He's like the dark, but I'd want him

Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead, but I sail away

On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave, wave

I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Niño
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation

Wave, wave

Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm, mhm, mhm, hm
Hm-hm, mhm, hm

Missy aggravation
Some sacred questions
You stroke my locks
Some marijuana if you got some

Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
La, la
Oh, oh

Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms
You spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers
Gouge away
You can gouge away
Stay all day
If you want to
Mhm

Chained to the pillars
A 3-day party
I break the walls
And kill us all with holy fingers

Gouge away (La la)
You can gouge away
Stay all day

This is a song for Carol!

You're into Japanese fast food
And I dropped off your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That tastes a bit like everyone
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine

I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda, he bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep yep, yep!
I make you pray, you make me hard
Your island skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine

Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

Put this down for the record
It’s more or less un-checkered
Wasted days and wasted nights
Made me a fucking beggar
No soul, my milk is curdled
I’m the burgermeister of purgatory
Look out for that hot plate
Guess that’s all you got, great
You put the cock in cocktail, man
Well I put the tail in WAIT!
Watch me walk
Blowtorch a hole in the armor
And I don’t need the tip

I am in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I’m the one who’s got some trotters
You’ve many mouths to feed

Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me
Mixed messages from Sir Naff
Please authenticate
Just to be sure that you’re a sap
Set for stun automatica
Crap is their operative
Locomotive of the longest death

There goes Indie Cindy whose
Sails were black when it was windy
We offed ourselves in a lover’s pact
We threw ourselves into the sea
Well looksie what the wind washed back
As we follow the bouncing ball
They call this dance the washed up crawl

I am in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I’m the one who’s got some trotters
You’ve many mouths to feed
I am in love with your daughter

Hope everything is alright

What's that floating in the water?
Ol' Neptuna's only daughter
I believe in Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle
I believe in Mr. Grieves

Do you have another opinion? (Yup!)
Do you have another opinion?

La la la la, la la la la

Got finally off to finally dozing

As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile, it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed

I bleed

Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes

I bleed

Oh, oh, oh, oh

There's a place in the buried west
In a cave with a house in it
In the clay, the holes of hands
You can place a hand in hand

Estaba pensando sobreviviendo con mi sister en New Jersey
Ella me dijo que es una vida buena allá
Bien rica bien chévere
Y voy!
Puñeta!

We'll keep well-bred, we'll stay well-fed
We'll have all sons, they will be all well hung
They'll come and play, their friends will say
Your daddy's rich, your mamma's a pretty thing

That maid Maria, she's really OK
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Vamos a jugar por la playa

Ay! Muñeca cabrona! Maricona! Cabrona!

If we get bored we'll move to California

Got hair in a girl that flows to her bones
And a comb in her pocket if the wind get blown
Stripes on her eyes when she walks slow
But her face fall down when she go, go, go

Black tear falling on my lazy queen
Got a tattooed tit say "number 13"
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm...

Choir in the yard in the house next door
Where a grandma brought some songs from the shore
Six foot girl gonna sweat when she dig
Stand close to the fire when they light the pig

Standing in her chinos shirt pulled off clean
Got a tattooed tit say "number 13"
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm...
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I grow lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

I miss your kiss and then I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet then send it to me

I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine

P-I-X-I-E-S

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I hate this street
Give dirt to me
I've got lament
This human form
Where I was born
I now repent

Give me white
Ground to run
Air for gun
Let me knife
Knife me let
I will get
What I like
