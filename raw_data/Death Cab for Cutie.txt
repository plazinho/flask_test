Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind; I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down; the time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Then I'll follow you into the dark69EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The Atlantic was born today, and I'll tell you how
The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no island should go
Oh, no

Most people were overjoyed, they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
Have been silenced forevermore
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before
Oh, no

I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer

I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer

So come on, come on
So come on, come on
So come on, come on
So come on, come on
So come on, come on
So come on, come on33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
And it came to me then that every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me
Amongst the vending machines and year-old​ magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were truth I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself
'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:
That love is watching someone die
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel, feel what it's like to be new
'Cause in my head, there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
Where they're far more suited than here

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me, too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
And I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me, too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) Where all the old buildings stood
(Gold rush) And they keep digging it down and down
(Gold rush) So that their cars can live underground
(Gold rush) The swinging of a wrecking ball
(Gold rush) Through these lath and plaster walls
(Gold rush) Is letting all the shadows free
(Gold rush) The ones I wish still followed me

(Change) Followed me, followed me
(Please don't change)
(Stay) Followed me, followed me
(Stay the same)

(Gold rush) I remember a winter's night
(Gold rush) We kissed beneath the street lamp light
(Gold rush) Outside our bar near the record store
(Gold rush) That have been condos for a year and more
(Gold rush) Now that our haunts have taken flight
(Gold rush) And been replaced with construction sites
(Gold rush) Oh, how I feel like a stranger here
(Gold rush) Searching for something that's disappeared
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) For what they say is the greater good
(Gold rush) But all I see is a long goodbye
(Gold rush) A requiem for a skyline
(Gold rush) It seems I never stopped losing you
(Gold rush) As every dive becomes something new
(Gold rush) And all our ghosts get swept away
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way

(Change) Be this way, be this way
(Please don't change)
(Stay) Be this way, be this way
(Stay the same)
(Cranes) Be this way, be this way
(Devour the light)
(Strange) Be this way, be this way
(Appetite)

I've ascribed these monuments
A false sense of permanence
I've placed faith in geography
To hold you in my memory
(Gold rush) I'm sifting through these wreckage piles
(Gold rush) Through the rubble of bricks and wires
(Gold rush) Looking for something I'll never find
(Gold rush) Looking for something I'll never find
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) Where all the old buildings stood
(Gold rush) And they keep digging it down and down
(Gold rush) So that their cars can live underground
(Gold rush) It seems I never stopped losing you
(Gold rush) As every dive becomes something new
(Gold rush) And all our ghosts get swept away
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way

Change
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
Please don't change
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
Stay, stay the same
(Gold rush)
It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush)
It didn't use to be this way
Stay the same
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way

:
There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
There is fear in the eyes of your father
And there is "yours" and there is "mine"
There is a desert veiled in pavement
And there's a city of seven hills
All our debris flows to the ocean
To meet again, I hope it will
:
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
:
There is an answer in a question
And there is hope within despair
And there is beauty in a failure
And there are depths beyond compare
There is a role of a lifetime
And there's a song yet to be sung
And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

There is whiskey in the water
And there is death upon the vine
And there is grace within forgiveness
But it's so hard for me to find

How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
And when I see you, I really see you upside down
But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around, turns you around
If you feel discouraged that there's a lack of color here
Please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams
From absorbing everything, the spectrums A to Z

This is fact, not fiction, for the first time in years
All the girls in every girly magazine can't make me feel any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone to call at 7:03
And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But I know it's too late, I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay

This is fact, not fiction, for the first time in years9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
This is the moment
That you know
That you told her that you loved her, but you don't
You touch her skin
And then, you think
That she is beautiful
But she don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she is beautiful
But she don't mean a thing to me

I spent two weeks
In Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl
With light brown streaks
And she was beautiful
But she didn't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she was beautiful
But she didn't mean a thing to me

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling, all the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave that left a mark
When tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did, and so did I that day
And all I see
Are dark grey clouds
In the distance, moving closer with every hour
So when you ask, "Is something wrong?"
I think, "You're damn right there is
But we can't talk about it now"
No, we can't talk about it now

So one last touch, and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful
But you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, you are beautiful
But you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, you are beautiful
But you don't mean a thing to me11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I roll the window down
And then begin to breathe in
The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as
You are driving me home
Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between
Shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as
You are driving me home
"Do they collide?"
I ask, and you smile
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter
When you feel embarrassed
Then, I'll be your pride
When you need directions
Then, I'll be the guide
For all time
For all time17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If only you had known me before the accident
For with that grand collision, came a grave consequence
Receptors overloaded; they burst and disconnect
Til there was little feeling, please work with what is left

Oh, I need not be flattered, that you've never been here before
So there’s no need to mention, that you've no firsts anymore
But if you let me be your skyline, I’ll let you be the wave
That reduces me to rubble, but looked safe from far away

I don’t know why, I don’t know why I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

You wanna teach but not be taught
And I wanna sell but not be bought
So let us not be lonesome
So let us not be lonesome
Lost in between our needs and wants
Our needs and wants
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
Cause I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident
On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete
In the city where we still reside
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
Cause I'm not who I used to be8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
The glove compartment
Is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it
So I'm proposing
A swift, orderly change
Because behind its door
There's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find
Are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam
Of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life

I was searching
For some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon
Pictures I tried to forget
And that's how this idea
Was drilled into my head
'Cause it's too important
To stay the way it's been

But there's no blame
For how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone
It's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest
Where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

And there's no blame
For how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone
It's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest
Where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night
Up all night
When I'm lying awake at night9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I dreamt we spoke, I dreamt we spoke again
It'd been so long, it'd been so long my mind filled in the blanks
I dreamt we spoke, I dreamt we spoke again
It'd been so long, it'd been so long, your voice was like a ghost

In my head
In my head

Only in, yes, only in a dream
Is anything, is anything the way it used to be?
I dreamt we spoke, I dreamt we spoke again
But when I awoke, when I awoke I could not remember

Anything you said

It was 100 degrees
As we sat beneath a willow tree
Whose tears didn't care—they just hung in the air
And refused to fall, to fall
And I knew I'd made a horrible call
And now, the state line felt like the Berlin Wall
And there was no doubt about which side I was on
Mhm

'Cause I built you a home in my heart
With rotten wood, and it decayed from the start

'Cause you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along

I braved treacherous streets
And kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep
At all, woohoo, woohoo, ooh
'Cause at night the sun in retreat
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both
You're so cute when you're slurring your speech
But they're closing the bar, and they want us to leave

And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along

I'm a war of head versus heart
And it's always this way
My head is weak, and my heart always speaks
Before I know what it will say

And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
There were churches, theme parks, and malls
But there was nothing there all along4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
How I wish you could see the potential
The potential of you and me
It's like a book elegantly bound, but
In a language that you can't read just yet

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart

There are days when, outside your window
I see my reflection as I slowly pass
And I long for this mirrored perspective
When we'll be lovers, lovers at last

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart

You reject my advances
And desperate pleas
I won't let you let me down
So easily
So easily

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart

I will possess your heart

God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of springtime
Remembering when you were mine
In a still suburban town
When every Thursday I'd brave those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes
And we'd learn how our bodies worked

God damn the black night, with all its foul temptations
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside

And together there
In a shroud of frost the mountain air began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer than anyone would ever guess

Do you remember the J.A.M.C.?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you, but I swear on my name
They could smell it on me
But I've never been too good with secrets
No...

And together there
In a shroud of frost the mountain air began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Cath, she stands
With a well-intentioned man
But she can't relax
With his hand on the small of her back
And as the flash-bulbs burst
She holds a smile
Like someone would hold
A crying child

And soon everybody will ask
What became of you
'Cause your heart was dying fast
And you didn't know what to do

Cath, it seems
That you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed

But you said your vows
And you closed the door
On so many men
Who would have loved you more
And soon everybody will ask
What became of you
'Cause your heart was dying fast
And you didn't know what to do

The whispers that it won't last
Roll up and down the pews
But if their hearts were dying that fast
They'd have done the same as you
And I'd have done the same as you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If I could open my arms
And span the length of the Isle of Manhattan
I'd bring it to where you are
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson
If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing
And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings
I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you
And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate
"Half empty or half full?"
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown
Your love is gonna drown (5x)5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
So this is the new year
And I don't feel any different
The clanking of crystal
Explosions off in the distance
In the distance

So this is the new year
And I have no resolutions
Or self-assigned penance
For problems with easy solutions

So everybody put your best suit or dress on
Let's make believe that we are wealthy for just this once
Lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn
As thirty dialogs bleed into one
I wish the world was flat like the old days
Then I could travel just by folding a map
No more airplanes, or speed trains, or freeways
There'd be no distance that could hold us back

There'd be no distance that could hold us back
There'd be no distance that could hold us back
So this is the new year
So this is the new year
So this is the new year
So this is the new year7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don’t know where to begin
There’s too many things that I can’t remember
As I disappeared like a trend
In the hum of the five in the early morning
And now I'm taking my time
Up through Coalinga, through the valley
This highway lived in my mind
It takes me back to the place that made me

Was I in your way?
When the cameras turned to face you
No room in frame
For two

You cannot outrun a ghost
Speeding southbound lanes with abandon
It catches you on the coast
Or on the cliffs of the palisades, you killed the engine
And then it hovers above
Reeling bodies failing to discover
The thing they once knew was love
Raising their voices to convince one another
Was I in your way?
When the cameras turned to face you
No room in frame
For two

How can I stay
In the sun, when the rain flows
All through my veins?
It's true
And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we will both go on to get lonely with someone else
With someone else

Was I in your way?
When the cameras turned to face you
No room in frame

How can I stay

All through my veins?
It's true
