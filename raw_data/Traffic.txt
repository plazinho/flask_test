Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that, you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years


Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy (yeah)


Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy

Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that, you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had

There were three men came out of the West
Their fortunes for to try
And these three men made a solemn vow:
John Barleycorn must die
They've ploughed, they've sown, they've harrowed him in
Threw clods upon his head
And these three men made a solemn vow:
John Barleycorn was dead
They've let him lie for a very long time
Till the rains from heaven did fall
And little Sir John sprung up his head
And so amazed them all
They've let him stand till Midsummer's Day
Till he looked both pale and wan
And little Sir John's grown a long, long beard
And so become a man
They've hired men with the scythes so sharp
To cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him by the way
Serving him most barbarously
They've hired men with the sharp pitchforks
Who pricked him to the heart
And the loader he has served him worse than that
For he's bound him to the cart
They've wheeled him around and around the field
Till they came unto a barn
And there they made a solemn oath
On poor John Barleycorn
They've hired men with the crab-tree sticks
To cut him skin from bone
And the miller he has served him worse than that
For he's ground him between two stones
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl
And his brandy in the glass;
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl
Proved the strongest man at last
The huntsman, he can't hunt the fox
Nor so loudly to blow his horn
And the tinker he can't mend kettle nor pot
Without a little BarleycornEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
If you see something that looks like a star
And it's shooting up out of the ground
And your head is spinning from a loud guitar
And you just can't escape from the sound
Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you
We were children once, playing with toys

And the thing that you're hearing is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys

The percentage you're paying is too high priced
While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams
But today you just read that the man was shot dead
By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest
Was the low spark of high-heeled boys

If you had just a minute to breathe
And they granted you one final wish
Would you ask for something like another chance?
Or something similar as this?
Don't worry too much it'll happen to you
As sure as your sorrows are joys
And the thing that disturbs you is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys

The percentage you're paying is too high priced
While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams
But today you just read that the man was shot dead
By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest
Was the low spark of high-heeled boys, high-heeled boys




If I gave you everything that I owned
And asked for nothing in return
Would you do the same for me as I would for you?
Or take me for a ride
And strip me of everything including my pride
But spirit is something that no one destroys
And the sound that I'm hearing is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys, heeled boys

{Intro}
{Verse 1}
Found someone who can comfort me
But there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane
But I just want you to know
{Verse 2}
She's the one makes me feel so good
When everything is against me
Picks me up when I'm feeling down
So I've got something to show
{Chorus}
Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages
{Verse 3}
Often lost and forgotten
The vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard
But I've got something to show
{Chorus}
Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages
{Instrumental Bridge}
{Chorus}
Staring at empty pages
Centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages
Flowing along in the ages
{Verse 4}
Often lost and forgotten
The vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard
But I've got something to show
{Outro}
You know
Found someone who can comfort me
But there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane
But I just want you to know1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone's locked the door and took the key

You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself

Well, boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
And when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Got to stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself
Wait for me, yeah

All right, yeah

Don't get too lost in all I say
Though at the time I really felt that way
But that was then, now it's today
I can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and, yes, a different face

You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself
(Alright) You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well, you feeling all right?
I'm not feeling too good myself
You feeling all right?
I'm not feelin' too good myselfEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
You ride on the swing in and out of the bars
Capturing moments of life in a jar
Playing with children, acting as stars
Guiding your vision to heaven and heaven is in your mind
Take extra care not to lose what you feel
The apple you're eating is simple and real
Water the flowers that grow at your heel
Guiding your vision to heaven and heaven is in your mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Pretty Polly Possum what's wrong with you?
Your body's kind a weak
And you think there's nothing we can do
Good Golly Polly shame on you
Cause Molly made a stew that'll make a newer girl out of you
So follow me, it's good for you
That good old fashioned medicated goo
Ooo, ain't it good for you?
My own homegrown recipe'll see you through
Freaky Freddy Frolic had some I know
He was last seen picking green flowers in a field of snow
Get ready Freddy, they're sure to grow
Mother nature just blew it
And there's nothing really to it I know
So follow me, it's good for you
That good old fashioned medicated goo
Ooo, ain't it good for you?
My own homegrown recipe'll see you through
Aunty Franny Prickett and Uncle Lou
They made some goo
Now they really sock it to their friends
Frantic friends and neighbors charge the door
They caught a little whiff
Now they're digging it and seeking more
So follow me, it's good for you
That good old fashioned medicated goo
Ooo, ain't it good for you?
My own homegrown recipe'll see you through
So follow me, it's good for you
That good old fashioned medicated goo
Ooo, ain't it good for you?
My own homegrown recipe'll see you through2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
So you think you're having good times
With the boy that you just met
Kicking sand from beach to beach
Your clothes are soaking wet
But if you look around and see
A shadow on the run
Don't be too upset because it's just a paper sun
Ahh Paper Sun
Ahh Paper Sun
In the room where you've been sleeping
All your clothes are thrown about
Cigarettes burn window sills
Your meter's all run out
But then again it's nothing
You just split when day is done
Hitching lifts to nowhere, hung up on the paper sun
Standing in the cool of my room
Fresh cut flowers give me sweet perfume
Too much sun will burn!
When you're feeling tired and lonely
You see people going home
You can't make the train fare
Or the sixpence for the phone
And icicles you're crying
Down your cheek have just begun
Don't be sad, good times are had
Beneath the paper sun
Daylight breaks while you sleep on the sand
A seagull is stealing the ring from your hand
The boy who had given you so much fun
Has left you so cold in the paper sunEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
{Intro}
:
I looked in the sky
Where an elephant's eye
Was looking at me
From a bubblegum tree
And all that I knew was
The hole in my shoe which Was letting in water (letting in water)
I walked through a field
That just wasn't real
With 100 tin soldiers
Would shoot at my shoulder
And all that I knew was
The hole in my shoe that
Was letting in water (letting in water)
:
I climbed on the back of a giant albatross
Which flew through a crack in the cloud
To a place where happiness reigned all year round
And music played ever so loudly
:
I started to fall
And suddenly woke
And the dew on the grass
Had stuck to my coat
And all that I knew was
The hole in my shoe that
Was letting in water (letting in water)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Sometimes I feel like I'm fading away
You're looking at me, I've got nothing to say
Don't make me angry with the games that you play
Either light up or leave me alone

Walk in my room, you lie on my bed
Open your mouth, shoot someone dead
All of a sudden you're inside my head
Either light up or leave me alone


Spending my bread like it grew on a tree
You're trying to tell me 'bout the birds and the bees
The skirt that you're wearing is way past your knees
Either light up or leave me alone

You're up all night preaching your mind
Come home in the morning with your latest find
I'm gonna have to lay it to you straight on the line
Either light up or leave me alone

I'm looking for a girl who has no face
She has no name, or number
And so I search within his lonely place
Knowing that I won't find her
Well, I can't stop this feeling deep in inside me
Ruling my mind
I feel no sound
Don't know where I'm bound
The scenery is all the same to me
Nothing has changed or faded
I'm a part of it, some part of me
Painted cool green, and shaded
So, try to find myself must be the only way
To feel freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Struggling with confusion, disillusionment too
Can turn a man into a shadow, crying out from pain

Through his nightmare vision, he sees nothing, only well
Blind with the beggar's mind, he's but a stranger
He's but a stranger to himself

Suspended from a rope inside a bucket down a hole
His hands are torn and bloodied from the scratching at his soul
 (2x)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Like a hurricane around your heart when earth and sky are torn apart
He comes gathering up the bits while hoping that the puzzle fits
He leads you, he leads you
Freedom rider
With a silver star between his eyes that open up at hidden lies
Big man crying with defeat, see people gathering in the street
You feel him, you feel him
Freedom rider
When lightning strikes you to the bone, you turn around, you're all alone
By the time you hear that siren sound, then your soul is in the lost and found
Forever, forever
Freedom rider
Here it comesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Once again I'm northward bound, on the edge of sea and sky
Tomorrow is my friend, my one and only friend
We travel on together searching for the end

I'm a traveling soul and every mother's son
Although I'm getting tired I've got to travel on
Can you please help, my god? Can you please help, my god?
Can you please help, my god? I think it's only fair

Once again I'm northward bound, on the edge of sea and sky
Together we will go and see what waits for us
A backdoor to the universe, that old moon-dust

I'm a traveling soul and every mother's son
Although I'm getting tired I've got to travel on
Can you please help, my god? Can you please help, my god?
Can you please help, my god? I think it's only fair

Once again I'm northward bound, on the edge of sea and sky
Together we will go and see what waits for us
A backdoor to the universe, that old moon-dust

Forty thousand headmen couldn't make me change my mind
If I had to take the choice between the deafman and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea
Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing out towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot
Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine
Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, 'Just look behind'
So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the roadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
We are not like all the rest
You can see us any day of the week
Come around, sit down, take a sniff, fall asleep
Baby, you don't have to speak
I'd like to show you where it is
But then it wouldn't even mean a thing
Nothing is easy, baby, just please me
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
If for just one moment
You could step outside your mind
And float across the ceiling
I don't think the folks would mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Winwood/Capaldi)
'Till I find out, where will I go, where will I go
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where
The space is between my eyes
Open up the heavenly sky
Death awaits with pearly gates
Those who've been mesmerized
Many years has come and gone
Went to see a standing stone
Some in circles, some alone
Ancient, worn and weather torn
They chill me to my very bone
Many of these can be seen
In quiet places, fields of green
Of hedgerow lanes with countless names
But the only thing that remains are the roll right stones
Space age before my eyes
Opening up the skies
Marches slowly on to the pearly gate
For those who've been mesmerized
Many years has come and gone
But progress marches slowly on
In nature's paint, she hides the stain
Cause everybody is going insane
The only, the only thing that will sustain are the roll right stones
Went to see an ancient mound
People buried underground
Long ago, will never know
What it was like to hear their sounds
Black crow, I know you've been here
You've see the sights of yesteryear
You steal the grain of the conquered plain
But the only thing that remains are the roll right stones

And it's a fact, you are cold
They react, dream Gerrard
Hippos don't wear hats
Lobsters shriek if provoked
On long blue ribbons
That he may see
While he sleeps
Monsieur old Neddy
He wears spectacles in
Bed that he
May see dreams more clearly
The night, it will be black
And white raven croaking
I am thirsty, die
They won't let it be
They think it should be done
With reality
I scream from a skull
Fritz, bring your wigwam
They won't let it be
They think it should be done
With reality, with reality
They won't let it be
They think it should be done
With reality, with reality
They won't let it be
They think it should be done
With reality, with reality
They think it should be done
They think it should be done
With reality, with reality
With reality, with reality
They think it should be done
With reality, with reality
They won't let it be
