Only you can make all this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true, my one and only you
(One and only you)
 
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes!
 
When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay
While I pray

My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

My prayer
Is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words
That I'm longing to know

My prayer
And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer
 
Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time
When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time
Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun
I count the moments darling
'Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then
Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time
 
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
 
Remember love notes, the teacher found in school
The whole class laughing, gee I felt just like a fool
But that's not the very part about I
I had to write 1 thousand times
That I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Girl, I love you 1 thousand times
The love notes I treasured, loving you was not a sin
Punishment was pleasure, whoo I'd do it all over again
I wrote, and I wrote, till my fingers got sore
But I had to write just a little bit more
Did you read my letters, it's been on my mind?
All that it said was girl I love you one thousand times
From them until this very same day
I still feel that same old way
 
I'm sorry for the things I've done
I know that I'm the foolish one
Now that I see who's to blame
I'm so ashamed, I'm sorry
I'm sorry for the things I've said
Just like a child I lost my head
I should have known from the start
I'd break your heart, I'm sorry
Please be kind and I know you'll find
It's so easy to forgive
Darling, wait for it's not too late
Give our love a chance to live
I know the heartaches you've been through
I know for I've had heartaches, too
There's nothing more I can do
But say to you "I'm sorry"
Please be kind and I know you'll find
It's so easy to forgive
Darling, wait for it's not too late
Give our love a chance to live, oh live
I know the heartaches you've been through
I know for I've had heartaches, too
There's nothing more I can do
But say to you----"I'm sorry"
(Darling, I'm truly sorry)
 
Living is a dream when you make it seem enchanted
Lovers take for granted all the world's aglow, they ought to know
When you touch a star then you really are enchanted
Find a seed and plant it, love will make it grow
It's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover
And thrill to the wonders of night
And days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover
Your dreams run to dreams in continuous flight
Love is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted
When your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes
It's really grand when you stand hand in hand with your lover
And thrill to the wonders of night
And days, too, will amaze you and soon you'll discover
Your dreams run to dreams in continuous flight
Love is ecstasy, it's divine to be enchanted
When your dreams are slanted through a lover's eyes
 
Moonlight on the river Colorado
How I wish that I were there with you
As I sit and find each lonely, lonely shadow
Takes me back to days that we once knew
We were to wed in harvest time you said
That's why I'm longing for you
When it's moonlight on the Colorado
I wonder if you're waiting for me too
We were to wed in harvest time you said
That's why I'm longing for you
When it's moonlight on the river Colorado
I wonder if you're waiting for me too
 
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when I looked to the moon it turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when I looked to the moon it turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
 
(You'll never know)
You'll never, never know I care
You'll never know the torch I bear
You'll never know it, for I won't show it
Oh, no, you'll never, never know
(You'll never know)
You'll never, never see me cry
Not even when you're glancing by
For I won't weaken, when we're speaking
Oh, no, you'll never, never know
You'll know the used to me
That I was before
You'll see the used to be
That one you did adore
(You'll never know)
No, no I know I won't reveal
The way I really truly feel
But if you guess it
I'll confess it
Oh, darling nows the time to glow
Or else you'll never, never know
You'll know the used to me
That I was before
You'll see the used to be
That one you did adore
(You'll never know)
No, no I know I won't reveal
The way I really truly feel
But if you guess it
I'll confess it
Oh, darling nows the time to glow
Or else you'll never
No, no you'll never
Oh, no you'll never, ever know
(You'll never know)
 
I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights
Beside the silvery sea
I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
"Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me"
I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
"Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me"
 
(You've Got) The Magic Touch
You-oo-ve got The Magic Touch
You make me glow so much
It casts a spell, it rings a bell
The Magic Touch
Oh-uh-oh when I feel your charm
It's like a fourth alarm
You make me thrill so much
You've got The Magic Touch
If I go reeling, uh-oh, Im feeling the glow (uh-oh)
But where can I go from you
I didn't know too much
And then I felt your touch
And now I've learned I can return
The Magic Touch
If I go reeling, uh-oh, Im feeling the glow (uh-oh)
But where can I go from you
I didn't know too much
And then I felt your touch
And now I've learned I can return
The Magic Touch
 
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
Now the Rawlson is a Swedish town, the rillerah is a stream
The brawla is the boy and girl, the Hut-Sut is their dream
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
In a town in Sweden by a stream so clear and cool
There sat a boy just a fishin' and a dreamin' when he should have been in school
Now, he couldn't read or write a single Swedish word but happiness he found
In a little Swedish song he heard here's the way he made it sound
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
Now the girl played hooky from school that day, came down to the stream
She sat down beside the little Swedish boy and they began to dream
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla, brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla sooit
The brawla is the boy and girl, the Hut-Sut is their dream
The sooit is the teacher who caught them by the stream
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla, brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla sooit
Now the boy and girl are back in school, shattered is their dream
The teacher planted poison oak all along the stream
It's a crazy kind of a song to belong to a boy and girl
In love with a beautiful dream
But they love to sing, swing all the live long day
Shood to soon shahoon la shoon da shoo shooga shoogan on the Rillerah
 
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you, but I really must say
So goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
Well, it's three o'clock in the morning, (So there you are, you see)
Baby, you just won't treat me right, (Well I have my reasons)
I hate to leave you baby, and I swear I don't mean maybe
You know I love you so
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you, I really must say
So goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
Well, your mother, oh and your dad, (Wait a minute don't you get personal)
Wouldn't mind if i stayed here tonight, huh? (Oh, are you crazy?)
I hate to leave you baby, but don't mean maybe
You know I hate to go
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you, I really must say
So goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
 
There is one in a million like you
A dream in a million come true
I confess that I really don't know why
But I know that I glow like I do
Only once in a million is par
To find someone rare as you are
But now you're around
I have really found
That there's one in a million like you

Fate was surely kind to help my heart
Find someone like you to be my love
I give thinks each day
That you came my way
Way out of heaven to try love

Yes one in a lifetime you know
Above heaven started below
Though it may be rare
You and I do share
The love that has happened to few
For there's one in a million like you

Fate was surely kind to help my heart
Find someone like you to be my love
I give thinks each day
That you came my way
Way out of heaven to try love
Oh, yes

Yes one in a lifetime you know
Above heaven started below
Though it may be rare
You and I do share
The love that has happened to few
For there's one in a million like you
 
Oh promise me that someday you and I
Will take our love together to some sky
Where we can be alone and faith renew
And find the hollows where those flowers grew
Those first sweet violets of early spring
Which come in whispers, thrill us both, and sing
Of love unspeakable that is to be
Oh promise me, oh promise me
 
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man´s made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that´s a-weak and a back that´s strong
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin´ when the sun didn´t shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ´Well, a-bless my soul´
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin´, it was drizzlin´ rain
Fightin´ and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake* by an ol´ mama lion
Cain´t no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store
If you see me comin´, better step aside
A lotta men didn´t, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don´t a-get you, then the left one will
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store
 
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen)
And never been kissed (Been kissed, been kissed)
My teenage queen (My queen)
I can't resist kissing you
Please, please don't stop me
For you send my soul
And your mommy and poppy will know of my goal
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen)
I love only you (Just you, just you)
You are my queen (My dream)
It's time that you knew
And when our teen age is over
We'll walk down the aisle
And you'll still see
Sweet sixteen
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen)
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen)
I love only you (Just you, just you)
You are my dream (My dream)
Oh, it's time that you knew
And when our teen age is over
Oh, we'll walk down the aisle
And you'll still see
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Sweet sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
 
A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon, and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon, and two hearts in tune, in some lullaby
The firefly's gleam reflects in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high
Falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees, all dance in the breeze, and float on the ripple
We're deep in the spell, as nightingales tell of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon, and you
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon, and you
