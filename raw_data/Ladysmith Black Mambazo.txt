Oh Christ Oh Christ You Were Condemned
To Die On Roman's Cross At End Pilatus He Had Not The Will
To Send The Right Man To The Hill
So He Was Nailed Like Ugly Scum
To Trunks Of Shame The Carpenters Done
And He Screamed Out I Had The Will
But Father Left Me On The Hill
Oh Christ You Are A Lunatic
Oh Christ You're Just A Lunatic
Go On Scream Out You Had The Will
To Die For Us Upon The Hill

A family lived close to the jungle
At the end of the day they all sit together around the fire
They have their supper and relax and talk a little
The youngest boy becomes afraid
He hears all the sounds of the wild animals in the forest
Cheetahs, wolves jackals and lions
He starts crying at the darkness
And wild sounds that fill him with fear
Then his mother takes him in her arms
And sings to him
The family is always strong together
They protect one another
Grandparents, his father and mother
Uncles, aunts, cousins brothers and sisters
They all join and sing together
Soon he falls asleep, only the beautiful song fills his ears
Mbube, mbube, mbube, mbube
Mbube, mbube, mbube, mbube
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight
Hush, my baby, don't fear my darling
The lion sleeps tonight
Hush, my baby, don't fear my darling
The lion sleeps tonight

Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot

Coming for to carry me home
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Coming for to carry me home

Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
The brightest day that I can say
Coming for to carry me home
When Jesus washed my sins away
Coming for to carry me home

(A-wa) O kodwa you zo-nge li-sa namhlange
(A-wa a-wa) Si-bona kwenze ka kanjani
(A-wa a-wa) Amanto mbazane ayeza
She's a rich girl
She don't try to hide it
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
He's a poor boy
Empty as a pocket
Empty as a pocket with nothing to lose
Sing Ta na na
Ta na na na
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
People say she's crazy
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Well that's one way to lose these
Walking blues
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
She was physically forgotten
Then she slipped into my pocket
With my car keys
She said you've taken me for granted
Because I please you
Wearing these diamonds
And I could say Oo oo oo
As if everybody knows
What I'm talking about
As if everybody would know
Exactly what I was talking about
Talking about diamonds on the soles of her shoes
She makes the sign of a teaspoon
He makes the sign of a wave
The poor boy changes clothes
And puts on after-shave
To compensate for his ordinary shoes
And she said honey take me dancing
But they ended up by sleeping
In a doorway
By the bodegas and the lights on
Upper Broadway
Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes
And I could say Oo oo oo
As if everybody here would know
What I was talking about
I mean everybody here would know exactly
What I was talking about
Talking about diamonds
People say I'm crazy
I got diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Well that's one way to lose
These walking blues
Diamonds on the soles of our shoesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ain't No Sunshine
Ladysmith Black Mambazo
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
It's not warm when he's away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away
Wonder this time where he's gone
Wonder if he's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Hallelujah
